lbi-7641-96684-0000 AND AS A MORTAL APOLLO SOUGHT TO EARN HIS BREAD AMONGST MEN
lbi-7641-96684-0001 AFTERWARD PEOPLE WONDERED AT ADMETUS'S EVER SMILING FACE AND EVER RADIANT BEING
lbi-7641-96684-0002 THAT WAS BEFORE ADMETUS SAILED ON THE ARGO WITH JASON AND THE COMPANIONS OF THE QUEST
lbi-7641-96684-0003 THEREAFTER ADMETUS HAVING THE LOVE OF ALCESTIS WAS EVEN MORE HAPPY THAN HE HAD BEEN BEFORE
lbi-7641-96684-0004 A RADIANT FIGURE IT WAS AND ADMETUS KNEW THAT THIS WAS APOLLO COME TO HIM AGAIN
lbi-7641-96684-0005 BUT APOLLO TURNED TO ADMETUS A FACE THAT WAS WITHOUT JOY
lbi-7641-96684-0006 WHAT YEARS OF HAPPINESS HAVE BEEN MINE O APOLLO THROUGH YOUR FRIENDSHIP FOR ME SAID ADMETUS
lbi-7641-96684-0007 BUT STILL APOLLO STOOD BEFORE HIM WITH A FACE THAT WAS WITHOUT JOY
lbi-7641-96684-0008 HE SPOKE AND HIS VOICE WAS NOT THAT CLEAR AND VIBRANT VOICE THAT HE HAD ONCE IN SPEAKING TO ADMETUS
lbi-7641-96684-0009 ADMETUS ADMETUS HE SAID IT IS FOR ME TO TELL YOU THAT YOU MAY NO MORE LOOK ON THE BLUE SKY NOR WALK UPON THE GREEN EARTH
lbi-7641-96684-0010 IT IS FOR ME TO TELL YOU THAT THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD WILL HAVE YOU COME TO HIM ADMETUS ADMETUS KNOW THAT EVEN NOW THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD IS SENDING DEATH FOR YOU
lbi-7641-96684-0011 IF ONE WILL GO WILLINGLY IN THY PLACE WITH DEATH THOU CANST STILL LIVE ON GO ADMETUS
lbi-7641-96684-0012 AND THEN HE CAME UPON AN ANCIENT WOMAN WHO SAT UPON STONES IN THE COURTYARD GRINDING CORN BETWEEN TWO STONES
lbi-7641-96684-0013 THERE SHE WAS SITTING AS HE HAD FIRST KNOWN HER WITH HER EYES BLEARED AND HER KNEES SHAKING AND WITH THE DUST OF THE COURTYARD AND THE HUSKS OF THE CORN IN HER MATTED HAIR
lbi-7641-96684-0014 HE WENT TO HER AND SPOKE TO HER AND HE ASKED HER TO TAKE THE PLACE OF THE KING AND GO WITH DEATH
lbi-7641-96684-0015 BUT WHEN SHE HEARD THE NAME OF DEATH HORROR CAME INTO THE FACE OF THE ANCIENT WOMAN AND SHE CRIED OUT THAT SHE WOULD NOT LET DEATH COME NEAR HER
lbi-7641-96684-0016 ADMETUS TOOK THE MAN'S SHRIVELED HAND AND HE ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD NOT TAKE THE KING'S PLACE AND GO WITH DEATH THAT WAS COMING FOR HIM
lbi-7641-96684-0017 THEN ADMETUS WENT INTO THE PALACE AND INTO THE CHAMBER WHERE HIS BED WAS AND HE LAY DOWN UPON THE BED AND HE LAMENTED THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO GO WITH DEATH THAT WAS COMING FOR HIM FROM THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD AND HE LAMENTED THAT NONE OF THE WRETCHED ONES AROUND THE PALACE WOULD TAKE HIS PLACE
lbi-7641-96684-0018 ONE SHOULD GO IN YOUR PLACE FOR YOU ARE THE KING AND HAVE MANY GREAT AFFAIRS TO ATTEND TO
lbi-7641-96684-0019 NOW THE FOOTSTEPS SEEMED TO STOP
lbi-7641-96684-0020 IT WAS NOT SO TERRIBLE FOR HIM AS BEFORE
lbi-7641-96684-0021 AND THE WORDS HE HAD SPOKEN HE WOULD HAVE TAKEN BACK THE WORDS THAT HAD BROUGHT HER CONSENT TO GO WITH DEATH IN HIS PLACE
lbi-7641-96684-0022 DEATH WOULD SOON BE HERE FOR HER
lbi-7641-96684-0023 NO NOT HERE FOR HE WOULD NOT HAVE DEATH COME INTO THE PALACE
lbi-7641-96684-0024 HE LIFTED ALCESTIS FROM THE BED AND HE CARRIED HER FROM THE PALACE
lbi-7641-96684-0025 NO MORE SPEECH CAME FROM HER
lbi-7641-96684-0026 AND AS FOR ADMETUS HE WENT WITHIN THE CHAMBER AND KNELT BESIDE THE BED ON WHICH ALCESTIS HAD LAIN AND THOUGHT OF HIS TERRIBLE LOSS
lbi-7641-96684-0027 TO WHAT GOD IS THAT SACRIFICE DUE
lbi-7641-96684-0028 AND THEN HERACLES FELT THAT ANOTHER LABOR WAS BEFORE HIM
lbi-7641-96684-0029 I HAVE DRAGGED UP FROM THE UNDERWORLD HE THOUGHT THE HOUND THAT GUARDS THOSE WHOM DEATH BRINGS DOWN INTO THE REALM OF THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD
lbi-7641-96684-0030 WHY SHOULD I NOT STRIVE WITH DEATH
lbi-7641-96684-0031 AND WHAT A NOBLE THING IT WOULD BE TO BRING BACK THIS FAITHFUL WOMAN TO HER HOUSE AND TO HER HUSBAND
lbi-7641-96684-0032 HE LEFT THE PALACE OF ADMETUS AND HE WENT TO THE TEMPLE OF THE GODS
lbi-7641-96684-0033 YOU ARE HELD BY ME DEATH AND YOU WILL NOT BE LET GO UNLESS YOU PROMISE TO GO FORTH FROM THIS TEMPLE WITHOUT BRINGING ONE WITH YOU
lbi-7641-96684-0034 AND DEATH KNOWING THAT HERACLES COULD HOLD HIM THERE AND THAT THE BUSINESS OF THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD WOULD BE LEFT UNDONE IF HE WERE HELD PROMISED THAT HE WOULD LEAVE THE TEMPLE WITHOUT BRINGING ONE WITH HIM
lbi-7641-96684-0035 SHE WAS VEILED AND ADMETUS COULD NOT SEE HER FEATURES
lbi-7641-96684-0036 HERE IS A WOMAN WHOM I AM BRINGING BACK TO HER HUSBAND I WON HER FROM AN ENEMY
lbi-7641-96684-0037 THIS I CANNOT DO SAID ADMETUS I HAVE HAD PANGS ENOUGH
lbi-7641-96684-0038 THEN ADMETUS RAISED THE VEIL OF THE WOMAN HE HAD TAKEN ACROSS THE THRESHOLD OF HIS HOUSE
lbi-7697-105815-0000 HE NOW WENT ON TILL HE CAME TO THE HOUSE AT THE DOOR OF WHICH HE WAS TO KNOCK THIS HE DID TWO OR THREE TIMES
lbi-7697-105815-0001 CHRISTIAN I HAVE COME TO SEE THE GOOD MAN OF THE HOUSE
lbi-7697-105815-0002 CHRISTIAN SIR I AM COME FROM THE CITY OF DESTRUCTION AND AM ON MY WAY TO MOUNT ZION
lbi-7697-105815-0003 I WAS TOLD BY THE MAN THAT STANDS AT THE GATE THAT IF I CAME HERE YOU WOULD SHOW ME GOOD THINGS THAT WOULD HELP ME
lbi-7697-105815-0004 HE STOOD AS IF HE WOULD PLEAD FOR MEN AND A CROWN OF GOLD HUNG NEAR HIS HEAD
lbi-7697-105815-0005 CHRISTIAN WHAT DOES THIS MEAN
lbi-7697-105815-0006 THEN HE TOOK HIM TO A LARGE ROOM THAT WAS FULL OF DUST FOR IT HAD NOT BEEN SWEPT AND INTERPRETER TOLD HIS MAN TO SWEEP IT
lbi-7697-105815-0007 CHRISTIAN WHAT MEANS THIS
lbi-7697-105815-0008 THEN YOU NEXT SAW THE MAID COME IN TO LAY THE DUST SO IS SIN MADE CLEAN AND LAID LOW BY FAITH IN THE BOOK
lbi-7697-105815-0009 JUST AS CHRISTIAN CAME UP TO THE CROSS HIS LOAD SLID FROM HIS BACK CLOSE TO THE MOUTH OF THE TOMB WHERE IT FELL IN AND I SAW IT NO MORE
lbi-7697-105815-0010 AS HE STOOD THUS AND WEPT LO THREE BRIGHT ONES CAME TO HIM AND ONE OF THEM SAID PEACE BE TO THEE THOU HAST GRACE FROM THY SINS
lbi-7697-105815-0011 CHRISTIAN GAVE THREE LEAPS FOR JOY AND SANG AS HE WENT AH WHAT A PLACE IS THIS BLEST CROSS BLEST TOMB
lbi-7697-105815-0012 HE WENT ON THUS TILL HE CAME TO A VALE WHERE HE SAW THREE MEN WHO WERE IN A SOUND SLEEP WITH CHAINS ON THEIR FEET
lbi-7697-105815-0013 CHRISTIAN SIRS WHENCE COME YOU AND WHERE DO YOU GO
lbi-7697-105815-0014 FORMALIST AND HYPOCRISY WE WERE BORN IN THE LAND OF VAIN GLORY AND ARE ON OUR WAY TO MOUNT ZION FOR PRAISE
lbi-7697-105815-0015 KNOW YOU NOT THAT HE THAT COMES NOT IN AT THE DOOR BUT CLIMBS UP TO GET IN THE SAME IS A THIEF
lbi-7697-105815-0016 THEY TOLD CHRISTIAN THAT HE HAD NO NEED FOR CARE ON THAT SCORE FOR LONG USE HAD MADE IT LAW AND THEY COULD PROVE THAT IT HAD BEEN SO FOR YEARS
lbi-7697-105815-0017 YES SAID THEY NO DOUBT OF IT
lbi-7697-105815-0018 AND IF WE GET IN THE ROAD AT ALL PRAY WHAT ARE THE ODDS
lbi-7697-105815-0019 IS NOT OUR CASE AS GOOD AS YOURS
lbi-7697-105815-0020 I SAW THEN THAT THEY ALL WENT ON TILL THEY CAME TO THE FOOT OF THE HILL OF DIFFICULTY WHERE THERE WAS A SPRING
lbi-7697-105815-0021 NOW WHEN CHRISTIAN GOT AS FAR AS THE SPRING OF LIFE HE DRANK OF IT AND THEN WENT UP THE HILL
lbi-7697-105815-0022 NOW HALF WAY UP WAS A CAVE MADE BY THE LORD OF THAT HILL THAT THOSE WHO CAME BY MIGHT REST THERE
lbi-7697-105815-0023 TIMOROUS SAID THAT ZION WAS THE HILL THEY MEANT TO CLIMB BUT THAT WHEN THEY HAD GOT HALF WAY THEY FOUND THAT THEY MET WITH MORE AND MORE RISK SO THAT GREAT FEAR CAME ON THEM AND ALL THEY COULD DO WAS TO TURN BACK
lbi-7697-105815-0024 YES SAID MISTRUST FOR JUST IN FRONT OF US THERE LAY TWO BEASTS OF PREY IN OUR PATH WE KNEW NOT IF THEY SLEPT OR NOT BUT WE THOUGHT THAT THEY WOULD FALL ON US AND TEAR OUR LIMBS
lbi-7697-105815-0025 YET HE THOUGHT ONCE MORE OF WHAT HE HAD HEARD FROM THE MEN AND THEN HE FELT IN HIS CLOAK FOR HIS SCROLL THAT HE MIGHT READ IT AND FIND SOME PEACE
lbi-7697-105815-0026 HE FELT FOR IT BUT FOUND IT NOT
lbi-7697-105815-0027 SO HE FELL DOWN ON HIS KNEES TO PRAY THAT GOD WOULD GIVE HIM GRACE FOR THIS ACT AND THEN WENT BACK TO LOOK FOR HIS SCROLL
lbi-7697-105815-0028 OH FOOL THAT I AM SAID HE TO SLEEP IN THE DAY TIME SO TO GIVE WAY TO THE FLESH AS TO USE FOR EASE THAT REST WHICH THE LORD OF THE HILL HAD MADE BUT FOR THE HELP OF THE SOUL
lbi-7697-105815-0029 SUCH WAS THE LOT OF THE JEWS FOR THEIR SIN THEY WERE SENT BACK BY THE WAY OF THE RED SEA AND I AM MADE TO TREAD THOSE STEPS WITH GRIEF WHICH I MIGHT HAVE TROD WITH JOY HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THIS SLEEP
lbi-7697-105815-0030 HOW FAR MIGHT I HAVE BEEN ON MY WAY BY THIS TIME
lbi-7697-105815-0031 NOW BY THIS TIME HE HAD COME TO THE VALE ONCE MORE WHERE FOR A SPELL HE SAT DOWN AND WEPT BUT AT LAST AS HE CAST A SAD GLANCE AT THE FOOT OF THE BENCH HE SAW HIS SCROLL WHICH HE CAUGHT UP WITH HASTE AND PUT IN HIS CLOAK
lbi-7697-105815-0032 WORDS ARE TOO WEAK TO TELL THE JOY OF CHRISTIAN WHEN HE HAD GOT BACK HIS SCROLL
lbi-7697-105815-0033 HE LAID IT UP IN THE BREAST OF HIS COAT AND GAVE THANKS TO GOD
lbi-7697-105815-0034 WITH WHAT A LIGHT STEP DID HE NOW CLIMB THE HILL
lbi-7697-105815-0035 AH THOUGHT HE THESE BEASTS RANGE IN THE NIGHT FOR THEIR PREY AND IF THEY SHOULD MEET WITH ME IN THE DARK HOW SHOULD I FLY FROM THEM
lbi-7697-105815-0036 THE NAME OF THE MAN WHO KEPT THE LODGE OF THAT HOUSE WAS WATCHFUL AND WHEN HE SAW THAT CHRISTIAN MADE A HALT AS IF HE WOULD GO BACK HE CAME OUT TO HIM AND SAID IS THY STRENGTH SO SMALL
lbi-7697-105815-0037 FEAR NOT THE TWO WILD BEASTS FOR THEY ARE BOUND BY CHAINS AND ARE PUT HERE TO TRY THE FAITH OF THOSE THAT HAVE IT AND TO FIND OUT THOSE THAT HAVE NONE
lbi-7697-105815-0038 KEEP IN THE MIDST OF THE PATH AND NO HARM SHALL COME TO THEE
lbi-7697-105815-0039 THEN I SAW IN MY DREAM THAT STILL HE WENT ON IN GREAT DREAD OF THE WILD BEASTS HE HEARD THEM ROAR YET THEY DID HIM NO HARM BUT WHEN HE HAD GONE BY THEM HE WENT ON WITH JOY TILL HE CAME AND STOOD IN FRONT OF THE LODGE WHERE WATCHFUL DWELT
lbi-7697-105815-0040 CHRISTIAN SIR WHAT HOUSE IS THIS MAY I REST HERE TO NIGHT
lbi-7697-105815-0041 WHEN WATCHFUL TOLD HER WHY CHRISTIAN HAD COME THERE SHE SAID WHAT IS YOUR NAME
lbi-7697-105815-0042 THEN CHRISTIAN BENT DOWN HIS HEAD AND WENT WITH THEM TO THE HOUSE
lbi-7697-105815-0043 PIETY COME GOOD CHRISTIAN SINCE OUR LOVE PROMPTS US TO TAKE YOU IN TO REST LET US TALK WITH YOU OF ALL THAT YOU HAVE SEEN ON YOUR WAY
lbi-7697-105815-0044 CHRISTIAN WITH A RIGHT GOOD WILL AND I AM GLAD THAT YOU SHOULD ASK IT OF ME
lbi-7697-105815-0045 PRUDENCE AND FIRST SAY WHAT IS IT THAT MAKES YOU WISH SO MUCH TO GO TO MOUNT ZION
lbi-7697-105815-0046 THERE THEY SAY IS NO DEATH AND THERE I SHALL DWELL WITH SUCH AS LOVE THE LORD
lbi-7697-105815-0047 CHARITY HAVE YOU A WIFE AND BABES CHRISTIAN YES I HAVE
lbi-7697-105815-0048 CHARITY AND WHY DID YOU NOT BRING THEM WITH YOU
lbi-7697-105815-0049 BUT THEY WOULD NOT COME WITH ME NOR HAVE ME LEAVE THEM
lbi-7697-105815-0050 THUS DID CHRISTIAN TALK WITH THESE FRIENDS TILL IT GREW DARK AND THEN HE TOOK HIS REST IN A LARGE ROOM THE NAME OF WHICH WAS PEACE THERE HE SLEPT TILL BREAK OF DAY AND THEN HE SANG A HYMN
lbi-7697-105815-0051 AND THEY BROUGHT OUT THE JAW BONE OF AN ASS WITH WHICH SAMSON DID SUCH GREAT FEATS AND THE SLING AND STONE WITH WHICH DAVID SLEW GOLIATH OF GATH
lbi-7697-105815-0052 WHAT IS THE NAME OF THIS LAND SAID CHRISTIAN
lbi-7697-105815-0053 THEN THEY TOLD HIM IT WAS IMMANUEL'S LAND
lbi-7697-105817-0000 MORE THAN THIS HE HATH BEEN HEARD TO RAIL ON YOU MY LORD WHO ARE NOW HIS JUDGE
lbi-7697-105817-0001 JUDGE THY JUST DOOM WOULD BE TO DIE ON THE SPOT STILL LET US HEAR WHAT THOU HAST TO SAY
lbi-7697-105817-0002 THEN THE JUDGE TO SUM UP THE CASE SPOKE THUS YOU SEE THIS MAN WHO HAS MADE SUCH A STIR IN OUR TOWN
lbi-7697-105817-0003 THUS WHILE ONE LOST HIS LIFE FOR THE TRUTH A NEW MAN ROSE FROM HIS DEATH TO TREAD THE SAME WAY WITH CHRISTIAN
lbi-7697-105817-0004 COME GOOD HOPEFUL SAID CHRISTIAN LET US WALK ON THE GRASS
lbi-7697-105817-0005 SO THEY SET OFF THROUGH THE FIELD
lbi-7697-105817-0006 HOPEFUL I HAD MY FEARS FROM THE FIRST AND SO GAVE YOU A HINT CHRISTIAN GOOD FRIEND I GRIEVE THAT I HAVE BROUGHT YOU OUT OF THE RIGHT PATH
lbi-7697-105817-0007 HOPEFUL SAY NO MORE NO DOUBT IT IS FOR OUR GOOD
lbi-7697-105817-0008 CHRISTIAN WE MUST NOT STAND THUS LET US TRY TO GO BACK
lbi-7697-105817-0009 THEN SAID GIANT DESPAIR YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO FORCE YOUR WAY IN HERE THE GROUND ON WHICH YOU LIE IS MINE
lbi-7697-105817-0010 THEY HAD NOT MUCH TO SAY AS THEY KNEW THAT THEY WERE IN FAULT
lbi-7697-105817-0011 AND BY THIS ACT WE KILL OUR SOULS AS WELL
lbi-7697-245712-0000 FOUR WHETHER IN THAT STATE MAN WOULD HAVE BEEN MASTER OVER MEN
lbi-7697-245712-0001 THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN HAD NO MASTERSHIP OF THE ANIMALS
lbi-7697-245712-0002 THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE BEFORE MAN HAD DISOBEYED NOTHING DISOBEYED HIM THAT WAS NATURALLY SUBJECT TO HIM
lbi-7697-245712-0003 SECONDLY THIS IS PROVED BY THE ORDER OF DIVINE PROVIDENCE WHICH ALWAYS GOVERNS INFERIOR THINGS BY THE SUPERIOR
lbi-7697-245712-0004 THIRDLY THIS IS PROVED FROM A PROPERTY OF MAN AND OF OTHER ANIMALS
lbi-7697-245712-0005 NOW WHATEVER IS PARTICIPATED IS SUBJECT TO WHAT IS ESSENTIAL AND UNIVERSAL
lbi-7697-245712-0006 THEREFORE THE SUBJECTION OF OTHER ANIMALS TO MAN IS PROVED TO BE NATURAL
lbi-7697-245712-0007 THEY WOULD NOT HOWEVER ON THIS ACCOUNT HAVE BEEN EXCEPTED FROM THE MASTERSHIP OF MAN AS NEITHER AT PRESENT ARE THEY FOR THAT REASON EXCEPTED FROM THE MASTERSHIP OF GOD WHOSE PROVIDENCE HAS ORDAINED ALL THIS
lbi-7697-245712-0008 THIS IS SIGNIFIED BY THE FACT THAT GOD LED THE ANIMALS TO MAN THAT HE MIGHT GIVE THEM NAMES EXPRESSIVE OF THEIR RESPECTIVE NATURES
lbi-7697-245712-0009 SO ALL ANIMALS WOULD HAVE OBEYED MAN OF THEIR OWN ACCORD AS IN THE PRESENT STATE SOME DOMESTIC ANIMALS OBEY HIM
lbi-7697-245712-0010 OBJECTION ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN WOULD NOT HAVE HAD MASTERSHIP OVER ALL OTHER CREATURES
lbi-7697-245712-0011 MUCH LESS THEREFORE WOULD IT HAVE OBEYED MAN IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE
lbi-7697-245712-0012 THEREFORE SINCE IT IS BY HIS REASON THAT MAN IS COMPETENT TO HAVE MASTERSHIP IT SEEMS THAT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN HAD NO DOMINION OVER PLANTS
lbi-7697-245712-0013 NOW IN MAN REASON HAS THE POSITION OF A MASTER AND NOT OF A SUBJECT
lbi-7697-245712-0014 I ANSWER THAT WE MUST NEEDS ADMIT THAT IN THE PRIMITIVE STATE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN SOME INEQUALITY AT LEAST AS REGARDS SEX BECAUSE GENERATION DEPENDS UPON DIVERSITY OF SEX AND LIKEWISE AS REGARDS AGE FOR SOME WOULD HAVE BEEN BORN OF OTHERS NOR WOULD SEXUAL UNION HAVE BEEN STERILE
lbi-7697-245712-0015 THERE MIGHT ALSO HAVE BEEN BODILY DISPARITY
lbi-7697-245712-0016 INEQUALITY MIGHT ALSO ARISE ON THE PART OF NATURE AS ABOVE DESCRIBED WITHOUT ANY DEFECT OF NATURE
lbi-7697-245712-0017 OBJECTION ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MASTER OVER MAN
lbi-7697-245712-0018 THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO MAN
lbi-7697-245712-0019 IN ANOTHER SENSE MASTERSHIP IS REFERRED IN A GENERAL SENSE TO ANY KIND OF SUBJECT AND IN THIS SENSE EVEN HE WHO HAS THE OFFICE OF GOVERNING AND DIRECTING FREE MEN CAN BE CALLED A MASTER
lbi-7697-245712-0020 SUCH A KIND OF MASTERSHIP WOULD HAVE EXISTED IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE BETWEEN MAN AND MAN FOR TWO REASONS
lbi-7697-245715-0000 BUT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO WEAKNESS OF OLD AGE
lbi-7697-245715-0001 ON THE CONTRARY EVERYTHING GENERATED IS FIRST IMPERFECT BUT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE CHILDREN WOULD HAVE BEEN BEGOTTEN BY GENERATION
lbi-7697-245715-0002 THEREFORE FROM THE FIRST THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPERFECT IN BODILY SIZE AND POWER
lbi-7697-245715-0003 THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE THERE WAS NO NEED FOR WOMEN TO BE BORN ON THE CONTRARY NATURE'S PROCESS IN GENERATION WOULD HAVE BEEN IN HARMONY WITH THE MANNER IN WHICH IT WAS ESTABLISHED BY GOD
lbi-8173-294714-0000 I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT MISTER VAN BRANDT IS IN PRISON FOR DEBT I SAID
lbi-8173-294714-0001 AND I SAW FOR MYSELF LAST NIGHT THAT HE HAD LEFT YOU HELPLESS
lbi-8173-294714-0002 HE LEFT ME THE LITTLE MONEY HE HAD WITH HIM WHEN HE WAS ARRESTED SHE REJOINED SADLY
lbi-8173-294714-0003 HIS CRUEL CREDITORS ARE MORE TO BLAME THAN HE IS FOR THE POVERTY THAT HAS FALLEN ON US
lbi-8173-294714-0004 EVEN THIS NEGATIVE DEFENSE OF VAN BRANDT STUNG ME TO THE QUICK I OUGHT TO HAVE SPOKEN MORE GUARDEDLY OF HIM I SAID BITTERLY
lbi-8173-294714-0005 I OUGHT TO HAVE REMEMBERED THAT A WOMAN CAN FORGIVE ALMOST ANY WRONG THAT A MAN CAN INFLICT ON HER WHEN HE IS THE MAN WHOM SHE LOVES
lbi-8173-294714-0006 SHE PUT HER HAND ON MY MOUTH AND STOPPED ME BEFORE I COULD SAY ANY MORE
lbi-8173-294714-0007 HOW CAN YOU SPEAK SO CRUELLY TO ME SHE ASKED
lbi-8173-294714-0008 YOU KNOW TO MY SHAME I CONFESSED IT TO YOU THE LAST TIME WE MET YOU KNOW THAT MY HEART IN SECRET IS ALL YOURS
lbi-8173-294714-0009 WHAT WRONG ARE YOU TALKING OF
lbi-8173-294714-0010 IS IT THE WRONG I SUFFERED WHEN VAN BRANDT MARRIED ME WITH A WIFE LIVING AT THE TIME AND LIVING STILL
lbi-8173-294714-0011 DO YOU THINK I CAN EVER FORGET THE GREAT MISFORTUNE OF MY LIFE THE MISFORTUNE THAT HAS MADE ME UNWORTHY OF YOU
lbi-8173-294714-0012 IT IS NO FAULT OF MINE GOD KNOWS BUT IT IS NOT THE LESS TRUE THAT I AM NOT MARRIED AND THAT THE LITTLE DARLING WHO IS PLAYING OUT THERE WITH HER DOLL IS MY CHILD
lbi-8173-294714-0013 AND YOU TALK OF MY BEING YOUR WIFE KNOWING THAT THE CHILD ACCEPTS ME AS HER SECOND FATHER I SAID
lbi-8173-294714-0014 IT WOULD BE BETTER AND HAPPIER FOR US BOTH IF YOU HAD AS LITTLE PRIDE AS THE CHILD PRIDE SHE REPEATED
lbi-8173-294714-0015 IN SUCH A POSITION AS MINE
lbi-8173-294714-0016 A HELPLESS WOMAN WITH A MOCK HUSBAND IN PRISON FOR DEBT
lbi-8173-294714-0017 AM I TO MARRY YOU FOR MY FOOD AND SHELTER
lbi-8173-294714-0018 AM I TO MARRY YOU BECAUSE THERE IS NO LAWFUL TIE THAT BINDS ME TO THE FATHER OF MY CHILD
lbi-8173-294714-0019 BAD AS HE IS HE HAS NOT FORSAKEN ME HE HAS BEEN FORCED AWAY
lbi-8173-294714-0020 MY ONLY FRIEND IS IT POSSIBLE THAT YOU THINK ME UNGRATEFUL ENOUGH TO CONSENT TO BE YOUR WIFE
lbi-8173-294714-0021 THE WOMAN IN MY SITUATION MUST BE HEARTLESS INDEED WHO COULD DESTROY YOUR PLACE IN THE ESTIMATION OF THE WORLD AND THE REGARD OF YOUR FRIENDS
lbi-8173-294714-0022 THE WRETCHEDEST CREATURE THAT WALKS THE STREETS WOULD SHRINK FROM TREATING YOU IN THAT WAY
lbi-8173-294714-0023 OH WHAT ARE MEN MADE OF
lbi-8173-294714-0024 HOW CAN YOU HOW CAN YOU SPEAK OF IT
lbi-8173-294714-0025 I YIELDED AND SPOKE OF IT NO MORE
lbi-8173-294714-0026 EVERY WORD SHE UTTERED ONLY INCREASED MY ADMIRATION OF THE NOBLE CREATURE WHOM I HAD LOVED AND LOST
lbi-8173-294714-0027 BITTERLY AS I HATED THE MAN WHO HAD PARTED US I LOVED HER DEARLY ENOUGH TO BE EVEN CAPABLE OF HELPING HIM FOR HER SAKE HOPELESS INFATUATION
lbi-8173-294714-0028 I DON'T DENY IT I DON'T EXCUSE IT HOPELESS INFATUATION YOU HAVE FORGIVEN ME I SAID
lbi-8173-294714-0029 LET ME DESERVE TO BE FORGIVEN
lbi-8173-294714-0030 IT IS SOMETHING TO BE YOUR ONLY FRIEND
lbi-8173-294714-0031 YOU MUST HAVE PLANS FOR THE FUTURE TELL ME UNRESERVEDLY HOW I CAN HELP YOU
lbi-8173-294714-0032 COMPLETE THE GOOD WORK THAT YOU HAVE BEGUN SHE ANSWERED GRATEFULLY HELP ME BACK TO HEALTH
lbi-8173-294714-0033 MAKE ME STRONG ENOUGH TO SUBMIT TO A DOCTOR'S ESTIMATE OF MY CHANCES OF LIVING FOR SOME YEARS YET
lbi-8173-294714-0034 A DOCTOR'S ESTIMATE OF YOUR CHANCES OF LIVING I REPEATED WHAT DO YOU MEAN
lbi-8173-294714-0035 I HARDLY KNOW HOW TO TELL YOU SHE SAID WITHOUT SPEAKING AGAIN OF MISTER VAN BRANDT
lbi-8173-294714-0036 DOES SPEAKING OF HIM AGAIN MEAN SPEAKING OF HIS DEBTS I ASKED
lbi-8173-294714-0037 WHY NEED YOU HESITATE
lbi-8173-294714-0038 YOU KNOW THAT THERE IS NOTHING I WILL NOT DO TO RELIEVE YOUR ANXIETIES
lbi-8173-294714-0039 NEVER LET ME TELL YOU THE PLAIN TRUTH
lbi-8173-294714-0040 THERE IS A SERIOUS NECESSITY FOR HIS GETTING OUT OF PRISON
lbi-8173-294714-0041 YES THIS IS HIS POSITION IN TWO WORDS A LITTLE WHILE SINCE HE OBTAINED AN EXCELLENT OFFER OF EMPLOYMENT ABROAD FROM A RICH RELATIVE OF HIS AND HE HAD MADE ALL HIS ARRANGEMENTS TO ACCEPT IT
lbi-8173-294714-0042 UNHAPPILY HE RETURNED TO TELL ME OF HIS GOOD FORTUNE AND THE SAME DAY HE WAS ARRESTED FOR DEBT
lbi-8173-294714-0043 THE SNARE THAT HAD BEEN SET FOR HER WAS PLAINLY REVEALED IN THOSE FOUR WORDS
lbi-8173-294714-0044 IN THE EYE OF THE LAW SHE WAS OF COURSE A SINGLE WOMAN SHE WAS OF AGE SHE WAS TO ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES HER OWN MISTRESS
lbi-8173-294714-0045 WHAT WAS THERE TO PREVENT HER FROM INSURING HER LIFE IF SHE PLEASED AND FROM SO DISPOSING OF THE INSURANCE AS TO GIVE VAN BRANDT A DIRECT INTEREST IN HER DEATH
lbi-8173-294714-0046 THANKS TO THE HAPPY ACCIDENT OF MY POSITION THE ONE CERTAIN WAY OF PROTECTING HER LAY EASILY WITHIN MY REACH
lbi-8173-294714-0047 I COULD OFFER TO LEND THE SCOUNDREL THE MONEY THAT HE WANTED AT AN HOUR'S NOTICE AND HE WAS THE MAN TO ACCEPT MY PROPOSAL QUITE AS EASILY AS I COULD MAKE IT
lbi-8173-294714-0048 YOU ARE QUITE MISTAKEN I REPLIED
lbi-8173-294714-0049 I AM ONLY DOUBTING WHETHER YOUR PLAN FOR RELIEVING MISTER VAN BRANDT OF HIS EMBARRASSMENTS IS QUITE SO SIMPLE AS YOU SUPPOSE
lbi-8173-294714-0050 ARE YOU AWARE OF THE DELAYS THAT ARE LIKELY TO TAKE PLACE BEFORE IT WILL BE POSSIBLE TO BORROW MONEY ON YOUR POLICY OF INSURANCE
lbi-8173-294714-0051 I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT SHE SAID SADLY
lbi-8173-294714-0052 WILL YOU LET ME ASK THE ADVICE OF MY LAWYERS
