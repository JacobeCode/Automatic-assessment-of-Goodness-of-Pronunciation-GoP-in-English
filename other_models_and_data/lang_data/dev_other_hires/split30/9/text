lbi-2506-13150-0007 CAPTAIN QUOTH SHE FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE LET US GET ASHORE
lbi-2506-13150-0008 WAS NOT DEMOCRITUS WHO LAUGHED TEN TIMES MORE THAN I TOWN CLERK OF ABDERA
lbi-2506-13150-0009 NAY IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME YOU MAY READ THE CHAPTER FOR YOUR PAINS
lbi-2506-169427-0000 INTEREST HOWEVER STILL RUNS ON IN BOTH CASES THE PERIODICAL OR ACCIDENTAL PAYMENTS OF IT JUST SERVING TO KEEP THE MEMORY OF THE AFFAIR ALIVE TILL AT LENGTH IN SOME EVIL HOUR POP COMES THE CREDITOR UPON EACH AND BY DEMANDING PRINCIPAL UPON THE SPOT TOGETHER WITH FULL INTEREST TO THE VERY DAY MAKES THEM BOTH FEEL THE FULL EXTENT OF THEIR OBLIGATIONS
lbi-2506-169427-0001 AS THE READER FOR I HATE YOUR IFS HAS A THOROUGH KNOWLEDGE OF HUMAN NATURE I NEED NOT SAY MORE TO SATISFY HIM THAT MY HERO COULD NOT GO ON AT THIS RATE WITHOUT SOME SLIGHT EXPERIENCE OF THESE INCIDENTAL MEMENTOS
lbi-2506-169427-0002 TO SPEAK THE TRUTH HE HAD WANTONLY INVOLVED HIMSELF IN A MULTITUDE OF SMALL BOOK DEBTS OF THIS STAMP WHICH NOTWITHSTANDING EUGENIUS'S FREQUENT ADVICE HE TOO MUCH DISREGARDED THINKING THAT AS NOT ONE OF THEM WAS CONTRACTED THRO ANY MALIGNANCY BUT ON THE CONTRARY FROM AN HONESTY OF MIND AND A MERE JOCUNDITY OF HUMOUR THEY WOULD ALL OF THEM BE CROSS'D OUT IN COURSE
lbi-2506-169427-0003 EUGENIUS WOULD NEVER ADMIT THIS AND WOULD OFTEN TELL HIM THAT ONE DAY OR OTHER HE WOULD CERTAINLY BE RECKONED WITH AND HE WOULD OFTEN ADD IN AN ACCENT OF SORROWFUL APPREHENSION TO THE UTTERMOST MITE
lbi-2506-169427-0004 WHAT INCLINED EUGENIUS TO THE SAME OPINION WAS AS FOLLOWS
lbi-2506-169427-0005 YORICK FOLLOWED EUGENIUS WITH HIS EYES TO THE DOOR HE THEN CLOSED THEM AND NEVER OPENED THEM MORE
lbi-2506-169427-0006 ALAS POOR YORICK
lbi-3660-172182-0000 NOW THIS IS HOW ARTHUR HUNTED THE STAG
lbi-3660-172182-0001 AND THE LAST DOG THAT WAS LET LOOSE WAS THE FAVORITE DOG OF ARTHUR CAVALL WAS HIS NAME
lbi-3660-172182-0002 THEN THEY SOUNDED THE DEATH HORN FOR SLAYING AND THEY ALL GATHERED ROUND
lbi-3660-172182-0003 ONE WISHED THAT IT SHOULD BE GIVEN TO THE LADY BEST BELOVED BY HIM AND ANOTHER TO THE LADY WHOM HE LOVED BEST
lbi-3660-172182-0004 AND AFTER MIDDAY THEY BEHELD AN UNSHAPELY LITTLE MAN UPON A HORSE AND AFTER HIM A DAME OR A DAMSEL ALSO ON HORSEBACK AND AFTER HER A KNIGHT OF LARGE STATURE BOWED DOWN AND HANGING HIS HEAD LOW AND SORROWFULLY AND CLAD IN BROKEN AND WORTHLESS ARMOR
lbi-3660-172182-0005 I KNOW NOT WHO THEY ARE SAID HE BUT I KNOW SAID GUENEVER THIS IS THE KNIGHT WHOM GERAINT PURSUED AND METHINKS THAT HE COMES NOT HERE BY HIS OWN FREE WILL
lbi-3660-172182-0006 BUT GERAINT HAS OVERTAKEN HIM AND AVENGED THE INSULT TO THE MAIDEN TO THE UTTERMOST
lbi-3660-172182-0007 LADY SAID HE AT THE GATE THERE IS A KNIGHT AND I SAW NEVER A MAN OF SO PITIFUL AN ASPECT TO LOOK UPON AS HE
lbi-3660-172182-0008 I DO SAID HE HE TELLS ME THAT HE IS EDEYRN THE SON OF NUDD
lbi-3660-172182-0009 THEN SHE REPLIED I KNOW HIM NOT
lbi-3660-172182-0010 SO GUENEVER WENT TO THE GATE TO MEET HIM AND HE ENTERED
lbi-3660-172182-0011 AND GERAINT GREETS THEE WELL AND IN GREETING THEE HE COMPELLED ME TO COME HITHER TO DO THY PLEASURE FOR THE INSULT WHICH THY MAIDEN RECEIVED FROM THE DWARF NOW WHERE DID HE OVERTAKE THEE
lbi-3660-172182-0012 SIR SAID SHE WHEN THINKEST THOU THAT GERAINT WILL BE HERE
lbi-3660-172182-0013 TO MORROW LADY I THINK HE WILL BE HERE WITH THE MAIDEN

lbi-3660-172182-0015 WELL SAID ARTHUR FROM WHAT I HEAR IT BEHOOVES GUENEVER TO BE MERCIFUL TOWARDS THEE
lbi-3660-172182-0016 THE MERCY WHICH THOU DESIREST LORD SAID SHE WILL I GRANT TO HIM SINCE IT IS AS INSULTING TO THEE THAT AN INSULT SHOULD BE OFFERED TO ME AS TO THYSELF
lbi-3660-172182-0017 THUS WILL IT BE BEST TO DO SAID ARTHUR LET THIS MAN HAVE MEDICAL CARE UNTIL IT BE KNOWN WHETHER HE MAY LIVE
lbi-3660-172182-0018 TO GUENEVER AND HER HANDMAIDENS SAID HE
lbi-3660-172182-0019 AND THE STEWARD OF THE HOUSEHOLD SO ORDERED HER
lbi-3660-172182-0020 AND BEING YOUNG HE CHANGED HIMSELF AND GREW TO HATE THE SIN THAT SEEM'D SO LIKE HIS OWN OF MODRED ARTHUR'S NEPHEW AND FELL AT LAST IN THE GREAT BATTLE FIGHTING FOR THE KING
lbi-3660-172182-0021 AND WHEN GERAINT CAME TO THE PLACE WHERE GUENEVER WAS HE SALUTED HER
lbi-3660-172182-0022 THEN THEY WENT IN AND DISMOUNTED
lbi-3660-172182-0023 HEAVEN PROTECT THEE SAID ARTHUR AND THE WELCOME OF HEAVEN BE UNTO THEE
lbi-3660-172182-0024 AND INASMUCH AS THOU HAST VANQUISHED EDEYRN THE SON OF NUDD THOU HAST HAD A PROSPEROUS CAREER
lbi-3660-172182-0025 AND FROM THAT TIME SHE BECAME HIS WIFE
lbi-3660-172182-0026 AND THE MAIDEN TOOK UP HER ABODE IN THE PALACE AND SHE HAD MANY COMPANIONS BOTH MEN AND WOMEN AND THERE WAS NO MAIDEN MORE ESTEEMED THAN SHE IN THE ISLAND OF BRITAIN
lbi-3660-172182-0027 AND A YEAR AND A SECOND AND A THIRD HE PROCEEDED THUS UNTIL HIS FAME HAD FLOWN OVER THE FACE OF THE KINGDOM
lbi-3660-172182-0028 AND HE GREETS THEE WELL AS AN UNCLE SHOULD GREET HIS NEPHEW AND AS A VASSAL SHOULD GREET HIS LORD
lbi-3660-172182-0029 AND THE NEIGHBORING CHIEFS KNOWING THIS GROW INSOLENT TOWARDS HIM AND COVET HIS LAND AND POSSESSIONS
lbi-3660-172182-0030 AND ARTHUR TOLD GERAINT THE CAUSE OF THE MISSION AND OF THE COMING OF THE AMBASSADORS TO HIM OUT OF CORNWALL TRULY SAID GERAINT BE IT TO MY ADVANTAGE OR DISADVANTAGE LORD I WILL DO ACCORDING TO THY WILL CONCERNING THIS EMBASSY
lbi-3660-172182-0031 WHAT DISCOURSE SAID GUENEVER DO I HEAR BETWEEN YOU
lbi-3660-172182-0032 SAID GERAINT I THINK I SHALL HAVE ENOUGH OF KNIGHTHOOD WITH ME AND THEY SET FORTH
lbi-3660-172182-0033 AND NEVER WAS THERE SEEN A FAIRER HOST JOURNEYING TOWARDS THE SEVERN
lbi-3660-172182-0034 AND HE SAID TO GERAINT I AM A FEEBLE AND AN AGED MAN AND WHILST I WAS ABLE TO MAINTAIN THE DOMINION FOR THEE AND FOR MYSELF I DID SO
lbi-3660-172182-0035 AND EVERY ONE ASKED THAT WHICH HE DESIRED
lbi-3660-172182-0036 AND THEY WERE NOT LONG IN GIVING SO EAGER WAS EVERY ONE TO BESTOW GIFTS AND OF THOSE WHO CAME TO ASK GIFTS NONE DEPARTED UNSATISFIED
lbi-3660-172182-0037 THEN GERAINT SENT AMBASSADORS TO THE MEN OF CORNWALL TO ASK THEM THIS
lbi-3660-172182-0038 AND THEY ALL SAID THAT IT WOULD BE THE FULNESS OF JOY AND HONOR TO THEM FOR GERAINT TO COME AND RECEIVE THEIR HOMAGE
lbi-3660-172182-0039 SO HE RECEIVED THE HOMAGE OF SUCH AS WERE THERE
lbi-3660-172182-0040 AND THE DAY AFTER THE FOLLOWERS OF ARTHUR INTENDED TO GO AWAY
lbi-3660-172183-0000 GERAINT AS HE HAD BEEN USED TO DO WHEN HE WAS AT ARTHUR'S COURT FREQUENTED TOURNAMENTS

lbi-3660-172183-0010 AND HE DESIRED ENID TO MOUNT HER HORSE AND TO RIDE FORWARD AND TO KEEP A LONG WAY BEFORE HIM
lbi-3660-172183-0011 AND UNLESS I SPEAK UNTO THEE SAY NOT THOU ONE WORD EITHER
lbi-3660-172183-0012 AND THOUGH THOU SHOULDST DESIRE TO SEE MY DEFEAT AND MY DEATH BY THE HANDS OF THOSE MEN YET DO I FEEL NO DREAD
