060670002	I THINK YOU DID NOT LIKE HIS PARENTS
060670003	IT WAS SUCH AS A WONDERFUL DAY FOR ME
060670017	OLD MEN LIKE MYSELF YOU CARE NOTHING ABOUT
060670029	I AM QUITE SURE I DID NOT
060670035	ONLY LAST WEEK I WAS ASKED TO COME HERE
060670036	SHE HAD OWNED IT AT LAST
060670038	WHAT WILL HAPPENED NEXT I WONDER
060670041	IS SHE YOUNG AND PRETTY
060670044	YOU HAVE HAD IF OF OUR QUIET LIFE A READY
060670049	I WAS ANGRY WHEN I WROTE THEM
060670060	I WONDER WHERE THE POOR LADY LEFT IT
060670062	BUT WONDER OF WONDERS
060670072	HE LOOKED VERY HIGH OVER HER HEAD
060670075	AND HOW ABOUT YOUR DAD LAST NIGHT
060670080	BUT AS SUCH SHE WOULD NOT BE AFRAID OF HIM
060670094	THE COWS NEVER GAVE SO MUCH MILK AS THAT NIGHT
060670111	I KNOCKED AT THE DOOR AND ENTERED
060670140	BUT HE DID NOT MIND IT
060670144	AND THESE MEN WOULD LET HER GO AGAIN
060670149	DID HE LOVE HER
060990011	TO BE SURE YOU DID
060990014	THIS IS WHAT ALL MEN DO
060990023	SHE SAID SHE WOULD SEE HER
060990029	IN THE EVENING I WENT AGAIN WHEN I SAW HIM
060990030	BUT I FOUND HER OUT AT LAST
060990034	LOVE HIM HE DID NO AND COULD NOT
060990035	BUT THE TWO DID NO FIT
060990039	NO USE STANDING HER
060990059	THESE THINGS AND MANY OTHERS INTERESTED HER
060990078	THE LOVERS WERE ALL AROUND ABOUT IT
060990083	I WONDER WHAT I SHOULD HAVE DONE
060990089	WE WENT OUT TO SEE HIM
060990093	YOU KNOW WHAT THAT WILL MEAN
060990117	BELL AS THEIR TRUE MAN OF THEIR TIME
060990121	WHY THEY HAVE LOST THEIR HANDS
060990124	SHE WAS MORE THAN HIS MUCH
060990129	BUT THERE IS NO CRY OF HELPING
060990155	AND HE HELD ALL THE HAND
060990168	BUT IN THE NAME OF WONDER WHY
060990175	THE MAN TOLD WILLING FOR HIS OTHERS
069020006	THAT IS WHAT MR WRIGHT ASKS
069020020	AFTER ALL WHAT DID IT MATTER
069020024	WHAT DID I KNOW OF LIFE THEN
069020037	DID HE LEAVE THEM HERE
069020044	SAY SHALL IT BE HERE OR WHERE THEY ARE STANDING
069020048	BUT THEY CAN'T LAST
069020059	THEY DID NOT SEE THEM ANY MORE
069020065	SO I WENT AWAY AND SAID NOTHING
069020075	SHE MUST BE MADE TO STAY
069020090	I CALLED THIS ONE IN AND GAVE HIM HIS SUPPER
069020091	PUSHING THE DOOR OPEN I ENTERED
069020096	NO WONDER EVERY ONE HAS STOPPED TO LOOK
069020103	AT ALL EVENTS I WANT TO TRY
069020114	AS HE WENT HE CALLED OUT FOR HELP

069020175	AND WHAT DID THEY SEE
080630011	WHAT WOULD SHE DO UNDER THIS BE
080630014	THEIR FACES WERE SET HARD
080630019	DO YOU BELIEVE WE SHALL
080630030	LAUGH AS MUCH AS YOU LIKE
080630038	SOME SEEMED TO STAY HIS HAND
080630044	THE THING WAS TOO MUCH FOR ME
