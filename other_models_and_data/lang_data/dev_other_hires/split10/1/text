lbi-116-288045-0000 AS I APPROACHED THE CITY I HEARD BELLS RINGING AND A LITTLE LATER I FOUND THE STREETS ASTIR WITH THRONGS OF WELL DRESSED PEOPLE IN FAMILY GROUPS WENDING THEIR WAY HITHER AND THITHER
lbi-116-288045-0001 LOOKING ABOUT ME I SAW A GENTLEMAN IN A NEAT BLACK DRESS SMILING AND HIS HAND EXTENDED TO ME WITH GREAT CORDIALITY
lbi-116-288045-0002 HE MUST HAVE REALIZED I WAS A STRANGER AND WISHED TO TENDER HIS HOSPITALITY TO ME I ACCEPTED IT GRATEFULLY I CLASPED HIS HAND HE PRESSED MINE
lbi-116-288045-0003 WE GAZED FOR A MOMENT SILENTLY INTO EACH OTHER'S EYES
lbi-116-288045-0004 OF COURSE YOU ARE GOING THERE TOO I SAID TO MY FRIENDLY GUIDE
lbi-116-288045-0005 YES HE ANSWERED I CONDUCT THE WORSHIP I AM A PRIEST
lbi-116-288045-0006 AN IDOL I WHISPERED TAKEN BY SURPRISE
lbi-116-288045-0007 THEY WORSHIPPED GODS THAT DID NOT EXIST
lbi-116-288045-0008 BUT THE GREEKS LOVED THEIR GODS I PROTESTED MY HEART CLAMORING IN MY BREAST
lbi-116-288045-0009 NO I SAID IN A LOW VOICE
lbi-116-288045-0010 HE WAS AN IDOL THEN AND NOT A GOD
lbi-116-288045-0011 IT MADE ATHENS A CITY OF LIGHT IT CREATED THE BEAUTIFUL THE TRUE THE GOOD YES OUR RELIGION WAS DIVINE
lbi-116-288045-0012 IT HAD ONLY ONE FAULT INTERRUPTED MY GUIDE WHAT WAS THAT
lbi-116-288045-0013 I INQUIRED WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT HIS ANSWER WOULD BE IT WAS NOT TRUE
lbi-116-288045-0014 PRODUCE HIM
lbi-116-288045-0015 I WHISPERED TO MYSELF WHAT BLASPHEMY
lbi-116-288045-0016 THEN TAKING HEART I TOLD MY GUIDE HOW MORE THAN ONCE I HAD FELT APOLLO'S RADIANT PRESENCE IN MY HEART AND TOLD HIM OF THE IMMORTAL LINES OF HOMER CONCERNING THE DIVINE APOLLO
lbi-116-288045-0017 DO YOU DOUBT HOMER
lbi-116-288045-0018 I SAID TO HIM HOMER THE INSPIRED BARD
lbi-116-288045-0019 NO NO APOLLO IS NOT AN IDOL
lbi-116-288045-0020 HE IS A GOD AND THE SON OF A GOD
lbi-116-288045-0021 THE AIR WAS HEAVY WITH INCENSE A NUMBER OF MEN IN GORGEOUS VESTMENTS WERE PASSING TO AND FRO BOWING AND KNEELING BEFORE THE VARIOUS LIGHTS AND IMAGES
lbi-116-288045-0022 OBSERVING MY ANXIETY TO UNDERSTAND THE MEANING OF ALL THIS MY GUIDE TOOK ME ASIDE AND IN A WHISPER TOLD ME THAT THE PEOPLE WERE CELEBRATING THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE BIRTHDAY OF THEIR BEAUTIFUL SAVIOR JESUS THE SON OF GOD
lbi-116-288045-0023 FORGET APOLLO HE SAID WITH A SUGGESTION OF SEVERITY IN HIS VOICE
lbi-116-288045-0024 THERE IS NO SUCH PERSON HE WAS ONLY AN IDOL
lbi-116-288045-0025 IF YOU WERE TO SEARCH FOR APOLLO IN ALL THE UNIVERSE YOU WOULD NEVER FIND ANY ONE ANSWERING TO HIS NAME OR DESCRIPTION
lbi-116-288045-0026 I WANT TO SEE JESUS I HASTENED TURNING TOWARD HIM
lbi-116-288045-0027 WILL HE NOT BE HERE THIS MORNING
lbi-116-288045-0028 WILL HE NOT SPEAK TO HIS WORSHIPPERS I ASKED AGAIN
lbi-116-288045-0029 WILL HE NOT PERMIT THEM TO TOUCH HIM TO CARESS HIS HAND TO CLASP HIS DIVINE FEET TO INHALE THE AMBROSIAL FRAGRANCE OF HIS BREATH TO BASK IN THE GOLDEN LIGHT OF HIS EYES TO HEAR THE MUSIC OF HIS IMMACULATE ACCENTS
lbi-116-288045-0030 I ASKED MY EYES FILLED WITH WONDER AND MY VOICE QUIVERING WITH EXCITEMENT
lbi-116-288045-0031 WOULD NOT THAT THEN I VENTURED TO ASK IMPATIENTLY MAKE JESUS AS MUCH OF AN IDOL AS APOLLO
lbi-116-288045-0032 AND IF FAITH THAT JESUS IS A GOD PROVES HIM A GOD WHY WILL NOT FAITH IN APOLLO MAKE HIM A GOD
lbi-116-288046-0000 BUT I AM DETERMINED NOT ONLY TO KNOW IF IT IS POSSIBLE THE WHOLE TRUTH ABOUT JESUS BUT ALSO TO COMMUNICATE THAT TRUTH TO OTHERS
lbi-116-288046-0001 BUT THERE IS MORE OF A MORAL TONIC IN THE OPEN AND CANDID DISCUSSION OF A SUBJECT LIKE THE ONE IN HAND THAN IN A MULTITUDE OF PLATITUDES
lbi-116-288046-0002 I NEVER DELIVER A LECTURE IN WHICH I DO NOT EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY GIVE FULL AND FREE EXPRESSION TO MY FAITH IN EVERYTHING THAT IS WORTHY OF FAITH
lbi-116-288046-0003 IF I DO NOT BELIEVE IN DOGMA IT IS BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN FREEDOM
lbi-116-288046-0004 OH HE TEARS DOWN BUT DOES NOT BUILD UP IS ANOTHER CRITICISM ABOUT MY WORK IT IS NOT TRUE
lbi-116-288046-0005 NO PREACHER OR PRIEST IS MORE CONSTRUCTIVE
lbi-116-288046-0006 CLAPPING TRUTH INTO JAIL GAGGING THE MOUTH OF THE STUDENT IS THAT BUILDING UP OR TEARING DOWN
lbi-116-288046-0007 WHEN BRUNO LIGHTED A NEW TORCH TO INCREASE THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD WHAT WAS HIS REWARD THE STAKE
lbi-116-288046-0008 COUNT YOUR RIGHTS POLITICAL RELIGIOUS SOCIAL INTELLECTUAL AND TELL ME WHICH OF THEM WAS CONQUERED FOR YOU BY THE PRIEST
lbi-116-288046-0009 I WISH TO TELL YOU SOMETHING
lbi-116-288046-0010 BUT FIRST LET US BE IMPERSONAL THE EPITHETS IRREVERENT BLASPHEMER ATHEIST AND INFIDEL ARE FLUNG AT A MAN NOT FROM PITY BUT FROM ENVY
lbi-116-288046-0011 NOT HAVING THE COURAGE OR THE INDUSTRY OF OUR NEIGHBOR WHO WORKS LIKE A BUSY BEE IN THE WORLD OF MEN AND BOOKS SEARCHING WITH THE SWEAT OF HIS BROW FOR THE REAL BREAD OF LIFE WETTING THE OPEN PAGE BEFORE HIM WITH HIS TEARS PUSHING INTO THE WEE HOURS OF THE NIGHT HIS QUEST ANIMATED BY THE FAIREST OF ALL LOVES THE LOVE OF TRUTH WE EASE OUR OWN INDOLENT CONSCIENCE BY CALLING HIM NAMES
lbi-116-288047-0000 A MYTH IS A FANCIFUL EXPLANATION OF A GIVEN PHENOMENON
lbi-116-288047-0001 THE MIND CRAVES FOR KNOWLEDGE THE CHILD ASKS QUESTIONS BECAUSE OF AN INBORN DESIRE TO KNOW
lbi-116-288047-0002 NOW AND THEN THEY CAME CLOSE ENOUGH TO SNAP AT EACH OTHER
lbi-116-288047-0003 WITH THIS MYTHUS THE PRIMITIVE MAN WAS SATISFIED UNTIL HIS DEVELOPING INTELLIGENCE REALIZED ITS INADEQUACY SCIENCE WAS BORN OF THAT REALIZATION
lbi-116-288047-0004 THE MYTH OF A ONE EYED PEOPLE LIVING IN INDIA HAS BEEN REPLACED BY ACCURATE INFORMATION CONCERNING THE HINDOOS
lbi-116-288047-0005 AND THIS IS PRECISELY THE USE TO WHICH MYTHS HAVE BEEN PUT
lbi-116-288047-0006 IS JESUS A MYTH
lbi-116-288047-0007 THERE IS IN MAN A FACULTY FOR FICTION
lbi-116-288047-0008 IT THINKS LESS THAN IT GUESSES
lbi-116-288047-0009 IT IS REFLECTION WHICH INTRODUCES A BIT INTO THE MOUTH OF IMAGINATION CURBING ITS PACE AND SUBDUING ITS RESTLESS SPIRIT
lbi-116-288047-0010 WE FILL THE SPACE ABOUT AND OVER US WITH SPIRITS FAIRIES GODS AND OTHER INVISIBLE AND AIRY BEINGS
lbi-116-288047-0011 WE COVET THE RAINBOW WE REACH OUT FOR THE MOON
lbi-116-288047-0012 OUR FEET DO NOT REALLY BEGIN TO TOUCH THE FIRM GROUND UNTIL WE HAVE REACHED THE YEARS OF DISCRETION
lbi-116-288047-0013 SCIENCE WAS NOT BORN UNTIL MAN HAD MATURED
lbi-116-288047-0014 GROWN UP PEOPLE CREATE SCIENCE
lbi-116-288047-0015 THE CRADLE IS THE WOMB OF ALL THE FAIRIES AND FAITHS OF MANKIND
lbi-116-288047-0016 THE SCHOOL IS THE BIRTHPLACE OF SCIENCE
lbi-116-288047-0017 RELIGION IS THE SCIENCE OF THE CHILD
lbi-116-288047-0018 IN THE DISCUSSION OF THIS SUBJECT I APPEAL TO THE MATURE NOT TO THE CHILD MIND
lbi-116-288047-0019 HE IS GOD'S MOUTHPIECE AND NO ONE MAY DISAGREE WITH HIM
lbi-116-288047-0020 THE ONLY WAY I MAY COMMAND YOUR RESPECT IS TO BE REASONABLE
lbi-116-288047-0021 LET US PLACE OURSELVES ENTIRELY IN THE HANDS OF THE EVIDENCE
lbi-116-288047-0022 AS INTELLIGENT BEINGS WE DESIRE TO KNOW WHETHER THIS JESUS WHOSE WORSHIP IS NOT ONLY COSTING THE WORLD MILLIONS OF THE PEOPLE'S MONEY BUT WHICH IS ALSO DRAWING TO HIS SERVICE THE TIME THE ENERGIES THE AFFECTION THE DEVOTION AND THE LABOR OF HUMANITY IS A MYTH OR A REALITY
lbi-116-288048-0000 A NUMBER OF OTHER DATES WERE OBSERVED BY THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH AT VARIOUS TIMES AS THE BIRTHDAY OF JESUS THE GOSPELS GIVE NO DATE AND APPEAR TO BE QUITE UNCERTAIN REALLY IGNORANT ABOUT IT
lbi-116-288048-0001 YET THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT HE WAS BORN ON THAT DAY
lbi-116-288048-0002 WHY THIS DISCREPANCY IN A HISTORICAL DOCUMENT TO SAY NOTHING ABOUT INSPIRATION
lbi-116-288048-0003 AGAIN MATTHEW SAYS THAT TO ESCAPE THE EVIL DESIGNS OF HEROD MARY AND JOSEPH WITH THE INFANT JESUS FLED INTO EGYPT LUKE SAYS NOTHING ABOUT THIS HURRIED FLIGHT NOR OF HEROD'S INTENTION TO KILL THE INFANT MESSIAH
lbi-116-288048-0004 WHEN WE COME TO THE MORE IMPORTANT CHAPTERS ABOUT JESUS WE MEET WITH GREATER DIFFICULTIES
lbi-116-288048-0005 WHILE IT IS ALWAYS ON A FRIDAY THAT THE CRUCIFIXION IS COMMEMORATED THE WEEK IN WHICH THE DAY OCCURS VARIES FROM YEAR TO YEAR
lbi-116-288048-0006 GOOD FRIDAY FALLS NOT BEFORE THE SPRING EQUINOX BUT AS SOON AFTER THE SPRING EQUINOX AS THE FULL MOON ALLOWS THUS MAKING THE CALCULATION TO DEPEND UPON THE POSITION OF THE SUN IN THE ZODIAC AND THE PHASES OF THE MOON
lbi-116-288048-0007 THE PAGAN OESTERA HAS BECOME THE CHRISTIAN EASTER
lbi-116-288048-0008 BUT IN THE ABSENCE OF EVIDENCE ORIGIN OFFERS THE FOLLOWING METAPHYSICAL ARGUMENTS AGAINST THE SCEPTICAL CELSUS ONE
lbi-116-288048-0009 IF WE ARE TO HAVE ANY MYTHOLOGY AT ALL HE SEEMS TO ARGUE WHY OBJECT TO ADDING TO IT THE MYTHUS OF JESUS
lbi-116-288048-0010 THE IMMEDIATE COMPANIONS OF JESUS APPEAR TO BE ON THE OTHER HAND AS MYTHICAL AS HE IS HIMSELF
lbi-116-288048-0011 WHO WAS MATTHEW WHO WAS MARK
lbi-116-288048-0012 WHO WERE JOHN PETER JUDAS AND MARY
lbi-116-288048-0013 THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE THAT THEY EVER EXISTED
lbi-116-288048-0014 IF PETER EVER WENT TO ROME WITH A NEW DOCTRINE HOW IS IT THAT NO HISTORIAN HAS TAKEN NOTE OF HIM
lbi-116-288048-0015 HERE AGAIN WE SEE THE PRESENCE OF A MYTH
lbi-116-288048-0016 HE WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO SAW THEM
lbi-116-288048-0017 PETER PAUL JOHN JAMES JUDAS OCCUPY THE STAGE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY
lbi-116-288048-0018 IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO EXPLAIN WHY THE CONTEMPORARIES OF JESUS THE AUTHORS AND HISTORIANS OF HIS TIME DO NOT TAKE NOTICE OF HIM
lbi-116-288048-0019 COULD THEY HAVE BEEN IN A CONSPIRACY AGAINST HIM
lbi-116-288048-0020 HOW ELSE IS THIS UNANIMOUS SILENCE TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR
lbi-116-288048-0021 HOW THEN ARE WE TO DECIDE WHICH OF THE NUMEROUS CANDIDATES FOR DIVINE HONORS SHOULD BE GIVEN OUR VOTES
lbi-116-288048-0022 AND SUCH A FAITH IS NEVER FREE IT IS ALWAYS MAINTAINED BY THE SWORD NOW AND BY HELL FIRE HEREAFTER
lbi-116-288048-0023 YET THE MOST IMPOSSIBLE UTTERANCES ARE PUT IN JESUS MOUTH
lbi-116-288048-0024 ONLY A MYTHICAL JESUS COULD VIRTUALLY HAND OVER THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNIVERSE TO COURTIERS WHO HAVE PETITIONS TO PRESS UPON HIS ATTENTION
lbi-116-288048-0025 MOREOVER IF JESUS COULD KEEP HIS PROMISE THERE WOULD BE TODAY NO MISERY IN THE WORLD NO ORPHANS NO CHILDLESS MOTHERS NO SHIPWRECKS NO FLOODS NO FAMINES NO DISEASE NO CRIPPLED CHILDREN NO INSANITY NO WARS NO CRIME NO WRONG
lbi-116-288048-0026 HAVE THESE PRAYERS BEEN ANSWERED
lbi-116-288048-0027 HOW MANY SELF DELUDED PROPHETS THESE EXTRAVAGANT CLAIMS HAVE PRODUCED
lbi-116-288048-0028 AND WHO CAN NUMBER THE BITTER DISAPPOINTMENTS CAUSED BY SUCH IMPOSSIBLE PROMISES
lbi-116-288048-0029 THE SAME WHICH THE PREACHERS OF TODAY GIVE HE PARRIED HIS ANSWER WITH MANY WORDS AND AT LENGTH SAID THAT THE PROMISE WAS TO BE TAKEN WITH THE PROVISION THAT WHAT WE ASKED FOR WOULD BE GIVEN IF GOD THOUGHT IT FOR OUR GOOD
lbi-116-288048-0030 BUT HE SAID IF YE ASK ANYTHING IN MY NAME I WILL DO IT AND IF IT WERE NOT SO I WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU
lbi-116-288048-0031 DID HE NOT MEAN JUST WHAT HE SAID
lbi-116-288048-0032 SELF EFFORT AND NOT PRAYER IS THE REMEDY AGAINST IGNORANCE SLAVERY POVERTY AND MORAL DEGRADATION
lbi-1255-138279-0000 IT WAS A NIGHT WHEN SORROW MAY COME TO THE BRIGHTEST WITHOUT CAUSING ANY GREAT SENSE OF INCONGRUITY WHEN WITH IMPRESSIBLE PERSONS LOVE BECOMES SOLICITOUSNESS HOPE SINKS TO MISGIVING AND FAITH TO HOPE WHEN THE EXERCISE OF MEMORY DOES NOT STIR FEELINGS OF REGRET AT OPPORTUNITIES FOR AMBITION THAT HAVE BEEN PASSED BY AND ANTICIPATION DOES NOT PROMPT TO ENTERPRISE
lbi-1255-138279-0001 STILL TO A CLOSE OBSERVER THEY ARE JUST AS PERCEPTIBLE THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT THEIR MEDIA OF MANIFESTATION ARE LESS TRITE AND FAMILIAR THAN SUCH WELL KNOWN ONES AS THE BURSTING OF THE BUDS OR THE FALL OF THE LEAF
lbi-1255-138279-0002 IF ANYTHING COULD BE DARKER THAN THE SKY IT WAS THE WALL AND IF ANY THING COULD BE GLOOMIER THAN THE WALL IT WAS THE RIVER BENEATH
lbi-1255-138279-0003 AN INDESCRIBABLE SUCCESSION OF DULL BLOWS PERPLEXING IN THEIR REGULARITY SENT THEIR SOUND WITH DIFFICULTY THROUGH THE FLUFFY ATMOSPHERE
lbi-1255-138279-0004 NOT LONG AFTER A FORM MOVED BY THE BRINK OF THE RIVER
lbi-1255-138279-0005 THIS WAS ALL THAT WAS POSITIVELY DISCOVERABLE THOUGH IT SEEMED HUMAN
lbi-1255-138279-0006 THE SHAPE WENT SLOWLY ALONG BUT WITHOUT MUCH EXERTION FOR THE SNOW THOUGH SUDDEN WAS NOT AS YET MORE THAN TWO INCHES DEEP
lbi-1255-138279-0007 AT THIS TIME SOME WORDS WERE SPOKEN ALOUD ONE
lbi-1255-138279-0008 TWO THREE
lbi-1255-138279-0009 FOUR FIVE
lbi-1255-138279-0010 BETWEEN EACH UTTERANCE THE LITTLE SHAPE ADVANCED ABOUT HALF A DOZEN YARDS
lbi-1255-138279-0011 HERE THE SPOT STOPPED AND DWINDLED SMALLER
lbi-1255-138279-0012 THEN A MORSEL OF SNOW FLEW ACROSS THE RIVER TOWARDS THE FIFTH WINDOW
lbi-1255-138279-0013 THE RIVER WOULD HAVE BEEN SEEN BY DAY TO BE OF THAT DEEP SMOOTH SORT WHICH RACES MIDDLE AND SIDES WITH THE SAME GLIDING PRECISION ANY IRREGULARITIES OF SPEED BEING IMMEDIATELY CORRECTED BY A SMALL WHIRLPOOL
lbi-1255-138279-0014 THE WINDOW WAS STRUCK AGAIN IN THE SAME MANNER
lbi-1255-138279-0015 THEN A NOISE WAS HEARD APPARENTLY PRODUCED BY THE OPENING OF THE WINDOW
lbi-1255-138279-0016 SAID THE BLURRED SPOT IN THE SNOW TREMULOUSLY
lbi-1255-138279-0017 I ASKED WHICH WAS YOUR WINDOW FORGIVE ME
lbi-1255-138279-0018 WELL I SAID THAT YOU MIGHT
lbi-1255-138279-0019 O MUST I IT IS WHEN SHALL WE BE MARRIED FRANK
lbi-1255-138279-0020 I HAVE MONEY
lbi-1255-138279-0021 AND WE LIVE IN TWO PARISHES DO WE WHAT THEN
lbi-1255-138279-0022 IF I SAID SO OF COURSE I WILL
lbi-1255-138279-0023 THE FACT IS I FORGOT TO ASK
lbi-1255-138279-0024 GOOD NIGHT FRANK GOOD NIGHT
lbi-1255-74899-0000 THINGS ARRANGE THEMSELVES
lbi-1255-74899-0001 BUT THE COUNTESS NEVER GAVE WAY AN INCH
lbi-1255-74899-0002 THE FOLLOWING WAS THE ANSWER WHICH SHE RETURNED TO THE NOTE WRITTEN TO HER BY AUNT JULIA
lbi-1255-74899-0003 I SHOULD NOT KNOW HOW TO DRINK WINE WITH THEM AND SHOULD DO A HUNDRED THINGS WHICH WOULD MAKE THEM THINK ME A BEAST
lbi-1255-74899-0004 BUT THE GIRL BEGGED FOR SOME DELAY
lbi-1255-74899-0005 IT WAS A MATTER THAT REQUIRED TO BE CONSIDERED
lbi-1255-74899-0006 PRIDE IN HIM MIGHT BE AS WEAK AS PRIDE IN THEM
lbi-1255-74899-0007 IF THEY WOULD PUT OUT THEIR HANDS TO HIM WHY SHOULD HE REFUSE TO PUT OUT HIS OWN
lbi-1255-74899-0008 OUR TAILOR RECEIVED HIM COURTEOUSLY HAVING LEARNED TO LIKE THE MAN UNDERSTANDING THAT HE HAD BEHAVED WITH HONESTY AND WISDOM IN REGARD TO HIS CLIENT AND RESPECTING HIM AS ONE OF THE WORKERS OF THE DAY BUT HE DECLARED THAT FOR THE LOVEL FAMILY AS A FAMILY HE DID NOT CARE FOR THEM PARTICULARLY
lbi-1255-74899-0009 THEY ARE POLES ASUNDER FROM ME HE SAID
lbi-1255-74899-0010 BUT BY YOUR GOOD FORTUNE AND MERIT IF YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO SAY SO YOU HAVE TRAVELLED FROM THE ONE POLE VERY FAR TOWARDS THE OTHER
lbi-1255-74899-0011 AT PRESENT I THINK THAT THE SENSE OF THE COUNTRY IS IN FAVOUR OF AN ARISTOCRACY OF BIRTH
lbi-1255-74899-0012 WHEN YOU WERE FOREMOST AMONG THEM DID YOU NOT WISH TO BE THEIR MASTER
lbi-1255-74899-0013 IT IS ONE TO WHICH ALL LEGISLATIVE AND ALL HUMAN EFFORTS SHOULD AND MUST TEND
lbi-1255-74899-0014 WHEN YOU MAKE MUCH WATER BOIL MISTER THWAITE SOME OF IT WILL PROBABLY BOIL OVER
lbi-1255-74899-0015 I QUITE AGREE WITH YOU THAT THE SILK GOWNS SHOULD BE KEPT FOR THEIR ELDERS AND SO THE CONVERSATION WAS ENDED
lbi-1255-74899-0016 WITH HER THERE WAS A REAL WISH THAT THE POLES MIGHT BE JOINED TOGETHER BY HER FUTURE HUSBAND
lbi-1255-74899-0017 IF YOU REALLY WISH IT YOU SHALL GO HE SAID
lbi-1255-74899-0018 AND A BLUE ONE TO BE MARRIED IN ALAS ME
lbi-1255-74899-0019 MUST I HAVE A PINK SILK GOWN TO WALK ABOUT IN EARLY IN THE MORNING
lbi-1255-74899-0020 I'D SOONER SEE YOU DARNING MY WORSTED STOCKINGS SWEETHEART
lbi-1255-74899-0021 I CAN DO THAT TOO
lbi-1255-74899-0022 AND NOW I'LL SIT DOWN AND WRITE A LETTER TO MY LORD
lbi-1255-90407-0000 HE HOPED NOTHING SERIOUS HAD HAPPENED TO DRAG HER OUT AT SUCH AN UNTOWARD TIME
lbi-1255-90407-0001 BUT AS THE RAIN GAVE NOT THE LEAST SIGN OF CESSATION HE OBSERVED I THINK WE SHALL HAVE TO GO BACK NEVER
lbi-1255-90407-0002 WHY NOT HE INQUIRED
lbi-1255-90407-0003 I CANNOT UNDERSTAND HOW YOU SHOULD KNOW ME WHILE I HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF YOU
lbi-1255-90407-0004 OH BUT YOU KNOW ME ABOUT ME AT LEAST
lbi-1255-90407-0005 I SHOULD THINK SO
lbi-1255-90407-0006 HE'S MY FATHER INDEED
lbi-1255-90407-0007 BUT WE HAVE BEEN TENANTS OF SYLVANIA CASTLE ON THE ISLAND HERE THIS SEASON
lbi-1255-90407-0008 MY FATHER'S IS A COMPARATIVELY HUMBLE RESIDENCE HARD BY
lbi-1255-90407-0009 BUT HE COULD AFFORD A MUCH BIGGER ONE IF HE CHOSE
lbi-1255-90407-0010 YOU HAVE HEARD SO
lbi-1255-90407-0011 I DON'T KNOW HE DOESN'T TELL ME MUCH OF HIS AFFAIRS
lbi-1255-90407-0012 MY FATHER SHE BURST OUT SUDDENLY IS ALWAYS SCOLDING ME FOR MY EXTRAVAGANCE
lbi-1255-90407-0013 WAS THAT THIS EVENING
lbi-1255-90407-0014 AND THERE ON THE NETS THEY SAT
lbi-1255-90407-0015 JOCELYN THOUGHT IT STRANGE THAT HE SHOULD BE THROWN BY FATE INTO A POSITION TO PLAY THE SON OF THE MONTAGUES TO THIS DAUGHTER OF THE CAPULETS
lbi-1255-90407-0016 NO I SHALL GO ON AND GET A LODGING IN BUDMOUTH TOWN IF EVER I REACH IT
lbi-1255-90407-0017 IT IS SO LATE THAT THERE WILL BE NO HOUSE OPEN EXCEPT A LITTLE PLACE NEAR THE STATION WHERE YOU WON'T CARE TO STAY
lbi-1255-90407-0018 THE ISLAND WAS AN ISLAND STILL
lbi-1255-90407-0019 THEY HAD NOT REALIZED THE FORCE OF THE ELEMENTS TILL NOW
lbi-1255-90407-0020 HE STEADIED HER BODILY BY ENCIRCLING HER WAIST WITH HIS ARM AND SHE MADE NO OBJECTION
lbi-1255-90407-0021 HE PITIED HER AND WHILE HE WONDERED AT IT ADMIRED HER DETERMINATION
lbi-1255-90407-0022 THEIR APPLICATION FOR ADMISSION LED TO THE WITHDRAWAL OF A BOLT AND THEY STOOD WITHIN THE GASLIGHT OF THE PASSAGE
lbi-1255-90407-0023 HE COULD SEE NOW THAT THOUGH SHE WAS SUCH A FINE FIGURE QUITE AS TALL AS HIMSELF SHE WAS BUT IN THE BLOOM OF YOUNG WOMANHOOD
lbi-1255-90407-0024 I WILL TELL THE SERVANT TO DO THIS AND SEND YOU UP SOMETHING TO EAT
lbi-1255-90407-0025 HE FELT RAVENOUSLY HUNGRY HIMSELF AND SET ABOUT DRYING HIS CLOTHES AS WELL AS HE COULD AND EATING AT THE SAME TIME
lbi-1255-90407-0026 BY THE AID OF SOME TEMPORARY WRAPS AND SOME SLIPPERS FROM THE CUPBOARD HE WAS CONTRIVING TO MAKE HIMSELF COMFORTABLE WHEN THE MAID SERVANT CAME DOWNSTAIRS WITH A DAMP ARMFUL OF WOMAN'S RAIMENT
lbi-1255-90407-0027 YOU ARE SLEEPY MY GIRL SAID PIERSTON
lbi-1255-90407-0028 HE AGAIN BECAME CONSCIOUS OF THE CHANGE WHICH HAD BEEN INITIATED DURING THE WALK
lbi-1255-90407-0029 THE WELL BELOVED WAS MOVING HOUSE HAD GONE OVER TO THE WEARER OF THIS ATTIRE
lbi-1255-90407-0030 AND HOW ABOUT LITTLE AVICE CARO
lbi-1255-90413-0000 SHE DRAWS CLOSE AND SATISFIES
lbi-1255-90413-0001 HE COULD NOT FORGET MISSUS PINE AVON'S EYES THOUGH HE REMEMBERED NOTHING OF HER OTHER FACIAL DETAILS
lbi-1255-90413-0002 AFTERWARDS THEY KEPT APART AWHILE IN THE DRAWING ROOM FOR FORM'S SAKE BUT EVENTUALLY GRAVITATED TOGETHER AGAIN AND FINISHED THE EVENING IN EACH OTHER'S COMPANY
lbi-1255-90413-0003 BUT THIS WAS NOT ALL
lbi-1255-90413-0004 BUT WAS HE ABLE
lbi-1255-90413-0005 IT WAS UNFAIR TO GO FURTHER WITHOUT TELLING HER EVEN THOUGH HITHERTO SUCH EXPLICITNESS HAD NOT BEEN ABSOLUTELY DEMANDED
lbi-1255-90413-0006 HE DETERMINED TO CALL IMMEDIATELY ON THE NEW INCARNATION
lbi-1255-90413-0007 SHE LIVED NOT FAR FROM THE LONG FASHIONABLE HAMPTONSHIRE SQUARE AND HE WENT THITHER WITH EXPECTATIONS OF HAVING A HIGHLY EMOTIONAL TIME AT LEAST
lbi-1255-90413-0008 BUT SOMEHOW THE VERY BELL PULL SEEMED COLD ALTHOUGH SHE HAD SO EARNESTLY ASKED HIM TO COME
lbi-1255-90413-0009 RAISING HER EYES IN A SLIGHTLY INQUIRING MANNER FROM THE BOOK SHE WAS READING SHE LEANT BACK IN THE CHAIR AS IF SOAKING HERSELF IN LUXURIOUS SENSATIONS WHICH HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM AND REPLIED TO HIS GREETING WITH A FEW COMMONPLACE WORDS
lbi-1255-90413-0010 JUST AS THEY TURN MADEIRA INTO PORT IN THE SPACE OF A SINGLE NIGHT SO THIS OLD AIR HAS BEEN TAKEN AND DOCTORED AND TWISTED ABOUT AND BROUGHT OUT AS A NEW POPULAR DITTY INDEED
lbi-1255-90413-0011 SHE THAWED A LITTLE AND THEN THEY WENT ON TO TALK ABOUT HER HOUSE WHICH HAD BEEN NEWLY PAINTED AND DECORATED WITH GREENISH BLUE SATIN UP TO THE HEIGHT OF A PERSON'S HEAD AN ARRANGEMENT THAT SOMEWHAT IMPROVED HER SLIGHTLY FADED THOUGH STILL PRETTY FACE AND WAS HELPED BY THE AWNINGS OVER THE WINDOWS
lbi-1255-90413-0012 YES I HAVE HAD MY HOUSE SOME YEARS SHE OBSERVED COMPLACENTLY AND I LIKE IT BETTER EVERY YEAR
lbi-1255-90413-0013 DON'T YOU FEEL LONELY IN IT SOMETIMES O NEVER
lbi-1255-90413-0014 WHAT AN UNCIVIL THING TO SAY SHE MURMURED IN SURPRISE
lbi-1255-90413-0015 IT IS RATHER UNCIVIL
lbi-1255-90413-0016 AS A PUNISHMENT SHE DID NOT RING THE BELL BUT LEFT HIM TO FIND HIS WAY OUT AS HE COULD
lbi-1255-90413-0017 I SAW HIM AT LADY CHANNELCLIFFE'S THE OTHER NIGHT
lbi-1255-90413-0018 JOCELYN PIERSTON
lbi-1255-90413-0019 O DIDN'T HE MARRY HER
lbi-1255-90413-0020 SAID MISSUS PINE AVON WITH A START
lbi-1255-90413-0021 BUT JOCELYN WAS RECEDING FROM THE PRETTY WIDOW'S HOUSE WITH LONG STRIDES
lbi-1255-90413-0022 LADY IRIS HAD LEFT THE DRAWING ROOM FOR A MOMENT TO SEE THAT ALL WAS RIGHT IN THE DINING ROOM AND WHEN HE WAS SHOWN IN THERE STOOD ALONE IN THE LAMPLIGHT NICHOLA PINE AVON
lbi-1255-90413-0023 SHE HAD BEEN THE FIRST ARRIVAL
lbi-1255-90413-0024 AS THE OTHER GUESTS DROPPED IN THE PAIR RETREATED INTO A SHADY CORNER AND SHE TALKED BESIDE HIM TILL ALL MOVED OFF FOR THE EATING AND DRINKING
lbi-1255-90413-0025 HE HAD NOT BEEN APPOINTED TO TAKE HER ACROSS TO THE DINING ROOM BUT AT THE TABLE FOUND HER EXACTLY OPPOSITE
lbi-1255-90413-0026 THE SPRING IN THE PRESENT CASE WAS THE ARTISTIC COMMENDATION SHE DESERVED AND CRAVED
lbi-1255-90413-0027 THE LADY ON JOCELYN'S LEFT WIFE OF A LORD JUSTICE OF APPEAL WAS IN LIKE MANNER TALKING TO HER COMPANION ON THE OUTER SIDE SO THAT FOR THE TIME HE WAS LEFT TO HIMSELF
lbi-1255-90413-0028 IT CAME FROM THE WIFE OF ONE OF HIS FATHER'S FORMER WORKMEN AND WAS CONCERNING HER SON WHOM SHE BEGGED JOCELYN TO RECOMMEND AS CANDIDATE FOR SOME POST IN TOWN THAT SHE WISHED HIM TO FILL
lbi-1585-131718-0000 WHAT IS NECESSARY TO THE COMPLETENESS OF THE STORY AT THIS STAGE IS NOT TO RECAPITULATE BUT TO TAKE UP SOME OF THE LOOSE ENDS OF THREADS WOVEN IN AND FOLLOW THEM THROUGH UNTIL THE CLEAR AND COMPREHENSIVE PICTURE OF EVENTS CAN BE SEEN
lbi-1585-131718-0001 THE WAY OF THE INVENTOR IS HARD
lbi-1585-131718-0002 HE CAN SOMETIMES RAISE CAPITAL TO HELP HIM IN WORKING OUT HIS CRUDE CONCEPTIONS BUT EVEN THEN IT IS FREQUENTLY DONE AT A DISTRESSFUL COST OF PERSONAL SURRENDER
lbi-1585-131718-0003 WHEN THE RESULT IS ACHIEVED THE INVENTION MAKES ITS APPEAL ON THE SCORE OF ECONOMY OF MATERIAL OR OF EFFORT AND THEN LABOR OFTEN AWAITS WITH CRUSHING AND TYRANNICAL SPIRIT TO SMASH THE APPARATUS OR FORBID ITS VERY USE
lbi-1585-131718-0004 POSSIBLY OUR NATIONAL OPTIMISM AS REVEALED IN INVENTION THE SEEKING A HIGHER GOOD NEEDS SOME CHECK
lbi-1585-131718-0005 POSSIBLY THE LEADERS WOULD TRAVEL TOO FAST AND TOO FAR ON THE ROAD TO PERFECTION IF CONSERVATISM DID NOT ALSO PLAY ITS SALUTARY PART IN INSISTING THAT THE PROCESSION MOVE FORWARD AS A WHOLE
lbi-1585-131718-0006 ON THE CONTRARY THE CONDITIONS FOR ITS ACCEPTANCE HAD BEEN RIPENING FAST
lbi-1585-131718-0007 YET THE VERY VOGUE OF THE ELECTRIC ARC LIGHT MADE HARDER THE ARRIVAL OF THE INCANDESCENT
lbi-1585-131718-0008 A NUMBER OF PARENT ARC LIGHTING COMPANIES WERE IN EXISTENCE AND A GREAT MANY LOCAL COMPANIES HAD BEEN CALLED INTO BEING UNDER FRANCHISES FOR COMMERCIAL BUSINESS AND TO EXECUTE REGULAR CITY CONTRACTS FOR STREET LIGHTING
lbi-1585-131718-0009 THUS IN A CURIOUS MANNER THE MODERN ART OF ELECTRIC LIGHTING WAS IN A VERY TRUE SENSE DIVIDED AGAINST ITSELF WITH INTENSE RIVALRIES AND JEALOUSIES WHICH WERE NONE THE LESS REAL BECAUSE THEY WERE BUT TEMPORARY AND OCCURRED IN A FIELD WHERE ULTIMATE UNION OF FORCES WAS INEVITABLE
lbi-1585-131718-0010 HENCE TWENTY YEARS AFTER THE FIRST EDISON STATIONS WERE ESTABLISHED THE METHODS THEY INVOLVED COULD BE FAIRLY CREDITED WITH NO LESS THAN SIXTY SEVEN PER CENT
lbi-1585-131718-0011 IT WILL BE READILY UNDERSTOOD THAT UNDER THESE CONDITIONS THE MODERN LIGHTING COMPANY SUPPLIES TO ITS CUSTOMERS BOTH INCANDESCENT AND ARC LIGHTING FREQUENTLY FROM THE SAME DYNAMO ELECTRIC MACHINERY AS A SOURCE OF CURRENT AND THAT THE OLD FEUD AS BETWEEN THE RIVAL SYSTEMS HAS DIED OUT
lbi-1585-131718-0012 IN FACT FOR SOME YEARS PAST THE PRESIDENTS OF THE NATIONAL ELECTRIC LIGHT ASSOCIATION HAVE BEEN CHOSEN ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY FROM AMONG THE MANAGERS OF THE GREAT EDISON LIGHTING COMPANIES IN THE LEADING CITIES
lbi-1585-131718-0013 THE OTHER STRONG OPPOSITION TO THE INCANDESCENT LIGHT CAME FROM THE GAS INDUSTRY
lbi-1585-131718-0014 THERE ALSO THE MOST BITTER FEELING WAS SHOWN
lbi-1585-131718-0015 THE GAS MANAGER DID NOT LIKE THE ARC LIGHT BUT IT INTERFERED ONLY WITH HIS STREET SERVICE WHICH WAS NOT HIS LARGEST SOURCE OF INCOME BY ANY MEANS
lbi-1585-131718-0016 HERE AGAIN WAS GIVEN A MOST CONVINCING DEMONSTRATION OF THE TRUTH THAT SUCH AN ADDITION TO THE RESOURCES OF MANKIND ALWAYS CARRIES WITH IT UNSUSPECTED BENEFITS EVEN FOR ITS ENEMIES
lbi-1585-131718-0017 THIS WAS NOT LONG NOR UNIVERSALLY THE SPIRIT SHOWN AND TO DAY IN HUNDREDS OF CITIES THE ELECTRIC AND GAS PROPERTIES ARE UNITED UNDER THE ONE MANAGEMENT WHICH DOES NOT FIND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO PUSH IN A FRIENDLY AND PROGRESSIVE WAY THE USE OF BOTH ILLUMINANTS
lbi-1585-131718-0018 THE MOST CONSPICUOUS EXAMPLE OF THIS IDENTITY OF INTEREST IS GIVEN IN NEW YORK ITSELF
lbi-1585-131718-0019 SO MUCH FOR THE EARLY OPPOSITION OF WHICH THERE WAS PLENTY
lbi-1585-131718-0020 BUT IT MAY BE QUESTIONED WHETHER INERTIA IS NOT EQUALLY TO BE DREADED WITH ACTIVE ILL WILL
lbi-1585-131718-0021 OF COURSE A GREAT MANY ACCOUNTS WERE WRITTEN AND READ BUT WHILE GENUINE INTEREST WAS AROUSED IT WAS NECESSARILY APATHETIC
lbi-1585-131718-0022 WE GOT IT AT A GREAT BARGAIN AND ONLY PAID A SMALL SUM DOWN AND THE BALANCE ON MORTGAGE
lbi-1585-131718-0023 WE SOLD THEM FOR FORTY CENTS BUT THERE WERE ONLY ABOUT TWENTY OR THIRTY THOUSAND OF THEM
lbi-1585-131718-0024 THE FOURTH YEAR I GOT IT DOWN TO THIRTY SEVEN CENTS AND I MADE ALL THE MONEY UP IN ONE YEAR THAT I HAD LOST PREVIOUSLY
lbi-1585-131718-0025 ONE OF THE INCIDENTS WHICH CAUSED A VERY GREAT CHEAPENING WAS THAT WHEN WE STARTED ONE OF THE IMPORTANT PROCESSES HAD TO BE DONE BY EXPERTS
lbi-1585-131718-0026 AFTER FEELING AROUND FOR SOME DAYS I GOT A CLEW HOW TO DO IT
lbi-1585-131718-0027 I THEN MADE ANOTHER MACHINE WHICH DID THE WORK NICELY
lbi-1585-131718-0028 INCIDENTALLY IT MAY BE NOTED AS ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE PROBLEMS BROUGHT TO EDISON THAT WHILE HE HAD THE FACTORY AT HARRISON AN IMPORTER IN THE CHINESE TRADE WENT TO HIM AND WANTED A DYNAMO TO BE RUN BY HAND POWER
lbi-1585-131718-0029 FOR MAKING THE DYNAMOS EDISON SECURED AS NOTED IN THE PRECEDING CHAPTER THE ROACH IRON WORKS ON GOERCK STREET NEW YORK AND THIS WAS ALSO EQUIPPED
lbi-1585-131718-0030 TO SIGMUND BERGMANN WHO HAD WORKED PREVIOUSLY WITH EDISON ON TELEPHONE APPARATUS AND PHONOGRAPHS AND WAS ALREADY MAKING EDISON SPECIALTIES IN A SMALL WAY IN A LOFT ON WOOSTER STREET NEW YORK WAS ASSIGNED THE TASK OF CONSTRUCTING SOCKETS FIXTURES METERS SAFETY FUSES AND NUMEROUS OTHER DETAILS
lbi-1585-131718-0031 IN THE EARLY PART OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTY ONE THE EDISON ELECTRIC LIGHT COMPANY LEASED THE OLD BISHOP MANSION AT SIXTY FIVE FIFTH AVENUE CLOSE TO FOURTEENTH STREET FOR ITS HEADQUARTERS AND SHOW ROOMS
lbi-1585-131718-0032 THIS WAS ONE OF THE FINEST HOMES IN THE CITY OF THAT PERIOD AND ITS ACQUISITION WAS A PREMONITORY SIGN OF THE SURRENDER OF THE FAMOUS RESIDENTIAL AVENUE TO COMMERCE
lbi-1585-131718-0033 THE EXPERIENCE WITH THE LITTLE GAS ENGINE WAS RATHER STARTLING
lbi-1585-131718-0034 ONE DAY IT WAS NOT GOING VERY WELL AND I WENT DOWN TO THE MAN IN CHARGE AND GOT EXPLORING AROUND
lbi-1585-131718-0035 FOR THE NEXT FOUR OR FIVE YEARS SIXTY FIVE WAS A VERITABLE BEEHIVE DAY AND NIGHT
lbi-1585-131718-0036 THE ROUTINE WAS VERY MUCH THE SAME AS THAT AT THE LABORATORY IN ITS UTTER NEGLECT OF THE CLOCK
lbi-1585-131718-0037 I WAS TELLING A GENTLEMAN ONE DAY THAT I COULD NOT KEEP A CIGAR EVEN IF I LOCKED THEM UP IN MY DESK THEY WOULD BREAK IT OPEN
lbi-1585-131718-0038 HE SUGGESTED TO ME THAT HE HAD A FRIEND OVER ON EIGHTH AVENUE WHO MADE A SUPERIOR GRADE OF CIGARS AND WHO WOULD SHOW THEM A TRICK
lbi-1585-131718-0039 HE SAID HE WOULD HAVE SOME OF THEM MADE UP WITH HAIR AND OLD PAPER AND I COULD PUT THEM IN WITHOUT A WORD AND SEE THE RESULT
lbi-1585-131718-0040 I THOUGHT NO MORE ABOUT THE MATTER
lbi-1585-131718-0041 I DIDN'T REMEMBER ANYTHING ABOUT IT
lbi-1585-131718-0042 I WAS TOO BUSY ON OTHER THINGS TO NOTICE
lbi-1585-131718-0043 SPEAKING OF THOSE DAYS OR NIGHTS EDISON SAYS YEARS AGO ONE OF THE GREAT VIOLINISTS WAS REMENYI
lbi-1585-131718-0044 HE WOULD TALK WITH ME BUT I NEVER ASKED HIM TO BRING HIS VIOLIN
lbi-1585-131718-0045 ONE NIGHT HE CAME WITH HIS VIOLIN ABOUT TWELVE O'CLOCK
lbi-1585-131718-0046 AFTER THAT EVERY TIME HE CAME TO NEW YORK HE USED TO CALL AT SIXTY FIVE LATE AT NIGHT WITH HIS VIOLIN
lbi-1585-131718-0047 ANOTHER VISITOR WHO USED TO GIVE US A GOOD DEAL OF AMUSEMENT AND PLEASURE WAS CAPTAIN SHAW THE HEAD OF THE LONDON FIRE BRIGADE
lbi-1585-131718-0048 HE WOULD GO OUT AMONG THE FIRE LADDIES AND HAVE A GREAT TIME
lbi-1585-131718-0049 SPEAKING OF TELLING STORIES I ONCE GOT TELLING A MAN STORIES AT THE HARRISON LAMP FACTORY IN THE YARD AS HE WAS LEAVING
lbi-1585-131718-0050 IT WAS WINTER AND HE WAS ALL IN FURS
lbi-1585-131718-0051 I HAD NOTHING ON TO PROTECT ME AGAINST THE COLD
lbi-1585-131718-0052 THEN I GOT PLEURISY AND HAD TO BE SHIPPED TO FLORIDA FOR CURE
lbi-1585-131718-0053 IT HAD MERELY ENJOYED THE DELIGHTS OF ANXIOUS ANTICIPATION AND THE PERILOUS PLEASURE OF BACKING EDISON'S EXPERIMENTS
lbi-1585-131718-0054 NOW ACTIVE EXPLOITATION WAS REQUIRED
