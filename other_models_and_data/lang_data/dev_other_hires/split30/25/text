lbi-700-122867-0000 VANITY AND VEXATION OF SPIRIT
lbi-700-122867-0001 THE SPRING WAS ABROAD IN THE LAND AND MARILLA'S SOBER MIDDLE AGED STEP WAS LIGHTER AND SWIFTER BECAUSE OF ITS DEEP PRIMAL GLADNESS
lbi-700-122867-0002 I MUST SAY WITH ALL HER FAULTS I NEVER FOUND HER DISOBEDIENT OR UNTRUSTWORTHY BEFORE AND I'M REAL SORRY TO FIND HER SO NOW
lbi-700-122867-0003 PERHAPS YOU'RE JUDGING HER TOO HASTY MARILLA
lbi-700-122867-0004 OF COURSE I KNEW YOU'D TAKE HER PART MATTHEW BUT I'M BRINGING HER UP NOT YOU
lbi-700-122867-0005 DEMANDED MARILLA ANXIOUSLY GOING OVER TO THE BED
lbi-700-122867-0006 ANNE COWERED DEEPER INTO HER PILLOWS AS IF DESIROUS OF HIDING HERSELF FOREVER FROM MORTAL EYES NO
lbi-700-122867-0007 GET RIGHT UP THIS MINUTE AND TELL ME
lbi-700-122867-0008 THIS MINUTE I SAY THERE NOW WHAT IS IT
lbi-700-122867-0009 ANNE HAD SLID TO THE FLOOR IN DESPAIRING OBEDIENCE
lbi-700-122867-0010 YES IT'S GREEN MOANED ANNE
lbi-700-122867-0011 I THOUGHT NOTHING COULD BE AS BAD AS RED HAIR
lbi-700-122867-0012 YOU HAVEN'T GOT INTO ANY SCRAPE FOR OVER TWO MONTHS AND I WAS SURE ANOTHER ONE WAS DUE
lbi-700-122867-0013 NOW THEN WHAT DID YOU DO TO YOUR HAIR
lbi-700-122867-0014 ANNE SHIRLEY DIDN'T YOU KNOW IT WAS A WICKED THING TO DO
lbi-700-122867-0015 YES I KNEW IT WAS A LITTLE WICKED ADMITTED ANNE
lbi-700-122867-0016 I KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO HAVE YOUR WORD DOUBTED
lbi-700-122867-0017 AND MISSUS ALLAN SAYS WE SHOULD NEVER SUSPECT ANYONE OF NOT TELLING US THE TRUTH UNLESS WE HAVE PROOF THAT THEY'RE NOT
lbi-700-122867-0018 BUT I HADN'T THEN AND I BELIEVED EVERY WORD HE SAID IMPLICITLY
lbi-700-122867-0019 WHO SAID WHO ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
lbi-700-122867-0020 OH I DIDN'T LET HIM IN THE HOUSE
lbi-700-122867-0021 IN A TRICE I SAW MYSELF WITH BEAUTIFUL RAVEN BLACK HAIR AND THE TEMPTATION WAS IRRESISTIBLE
lbi-700-122867-0022 OH MARILLA WHAT A TANGLED WEB WE WEAVE WHEN FIRST WE PRACTICE TO DECEIVE
lbi-700-122867-0023 YOUR HAIR MUST BE CUT OFF THERE IS NO OTHER WAY YOU CAN'T GO OUT WITH IT LOOKING LIKE THAT
lbi-700-122867-0024 WITH A DISMAL SIGH SHE WENT FOR THE SCISSORS
lbi-700-122867-0025 BUT THERE IS NOTHING COMFORTING IN HAVING YOUR HAIR CUT OFF BECAUSE YOU'VE DYED IT A DREADFUL COLOR IS THERE
lbi-700-122867-0026 I'M GOING TO WEEP ALL THE TIME YOU'RE CUTTING IT OFF IF IT WON'T INTERFERE
lbi-700-122867-0027 IT SEEMS SUCH A TRAGIC THING
lbi-700-122867-0028 ANNE WEPT THEN BUT LATER ON WHEN SHE WENT UPSTAIRS AND LOOKED IN THE GLASS SHE WAS CALM WITH DESPAIR
lbi-700-122867-0029 YES I WILL TOO
lbi-700-122867-0030 I NEVER THOUGHT I WAS VAIN ABOUT MY HAIR OF ALL THINGS BUT NOW I KNOW I WAS IN SPITE OF ITS BEING RED BECAUSE IT WAS SO LONG AND THICK AND CURLY
lbi-700-122867-0031 I EXPECT SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN TO MY NOSE NEXT
lbi-700-122867-0032 ANNE'S CLIPPED HEAD MADE A SENSATION IN SCHOOL ON THE FOLLOWING MONDAY BUT TO HER RELIEF NOBODY GUESSED THE REAL REASON FOR IT NOT EVEN JOSIE PYE WHO HOWEVER DID NOT FAIL TO INFORM ANNE THAT SHE LOOKED LIKE A PERFECT SCARECROW
lbi-700-122867-0033 IT'S HARD TO BE TOLD YOU LOOK LIKE A SCARECROW AND I WANTED TO SAY SOMETHING BACK BUT I DIDN'T
lbi-700-122867-0034 IT MAKES YOU FEEL VERY VIRTUOUS WHEN YOU FORGIVE PEOPLE DOESN'T IT
lbi-700-122867-0035 I MEAN TO DEVOTE ALL MY ENERGIES TO BEING GOOD AFTER THIS AND I SHALL NEVER TRY TO BE BEAUTIFUL AGAIN
lbi-700-122867-0036 OF COURSE IT'S BETTER TO BE GOOD
lbi-700-122867-0037 I DO REALLY WANT TO BE GOOD MARILLA LIKE YOU AND MISSUS ALLAN AND MISS STACY AND GROW UP TO BE A CREDIT TO YOU
lbi-700-122867-0038 DIANA SAYS WHEN MY HAIR BEGINS TO GROW TO TIE A BLACK VELVET RIBBON AROUND MY HEAD WITH A BOW AT ONE SIDE
lbi-700-122867-0039 I WILL CALL IT A SNOOD THAT SOUNDS SO ROMANTIC
lbi-700-122867-0040 MY HEAD IS BETTER NOW
lbi-700-122867-0041 IT WAS TERRIBLE BAD THIS AFTERNOON THOUGH
lbi-700-122868-0000 OF COURSE YOU MUST BE ELAINE ANNE SAID DIANA
lbi-700-122868-0001 OF COURSE IT WOULD BE ROMANTIC CONCEDED JANE ANDREWS BUT I KNOW I COULDN'T KEEP STILL
lbi-700-122868-0002 BUT IT'S SO RIDICULOUS TO HAVE A REDHEADED ELAINE MOURNED ANNE
lbi-700-122868-0003 AND ELAINE WAS THE LILY MAID
lbi-700-122868-0004 YOUR COMPLEXION IS JUST AS FAIR AS RUBY'S SAID DIANA EARNESTLY AND YOUR HAIR IS EVER SO MUCH DARKER THAN IT USED TO BE BEFORE YOU CUT IT
lbi-700-122868-0005 IT WAS SPLENDID TO FISH FOR TROUT OVER THE BRIDGE AND THE TWO GIRLS LEARNED TO ROW THEMSELVES ABOUT IN THE LITTLE FLAT BOTTOMED DORY MISTER BARRY KEPT FOR DUCK SHOOTING
lbi-700-122868-0006 IT WAS ANNE'S IDEA THAT THEY DRAMATIZE ELAINE
lbi-700-122868-0007 THOSE DAYS SHE SAID WERE SO MUCH MORE ROMANTIC THAN THE PRESENT
lbi-700-122868-0008 THEY HAD OFTEN GONE DOWN LIKE THIS AND NOTHING COULD BE MORE CONVENIENT FOR PLAYING ELAINE
lbi-700-122868-0009 THE BLACK SHAWL HAVING BEEN PROCURED ANNE SPREAD IT OVER THE FLAT AND THEN LAY DOWN ON THE BOTTOM WITH CLOSED EYES AND HANDS FOLDED OVER HER BREAST
lbi-700-122868-0010 IT SPOILS THE EFFECT BECAUSE THIS IS HUNDREDS OF YEARS BEFORE MISSUS LYNDE WAS BORN
lbi-700-122868-0011 JANE YOU ARRANGE THIS
lbi-700-122868-0012 IT'S SILLY FOR ELAINE TO BE TALKING WHEN SHE'S DEAD
lbi-700-122868-0013 JANE ROSE TO THE OCCASION
lbi-700-122868-0014 LEFT BEHIND AT THE LANDING
lbi-700-122868-0015 ANNE GAVE ONE GASPING LITTLE SCREAM WHICH NOBODY EVER HEARD SHE WAS WHITE TO THE LIPS BUT SHE DID NOT LOSE HER SELF POSSESSION
lbi-700-122868-0016 THERE WAS ONE CHANCE JUST ONE
lbi-700-122868-0017 UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES YOU DON'T THINK MUCH ABOUT MAKING A FLOWERY PRAYER
lbi-700-122868-0018 THE FLAT DRIFTED UNDER THE BRIDGE AND THEN PROMPTLY SANK IN MIDSTREAM
lbi-700-122868-0019 RUBY JANE AND DIANA ALREADY AWAITING IT ON THE LOWER HEADLAND SAW IT DISAPPEAR BEFORE THEIR VERY EYES AND HAD NOT A DOUBT BUT THAT ANNE HAD GONE DOWN WITH IT
lbi-700-122868-0020 THE MINUTES PASSED BY EACH SEEMING AN HOUR TO THE UNFORTUNATE LILY MAID
lbi-700-122868-0021 WHY DIDN'T SOMEBODY COME WHERE HAD THE GIRLS GONE
lbi-700-122868-0022 HER IMAGINATION BEGAN TO SUGGEST ALL MANNER OF GRUESOME POSSIBILITIES TO HER
lbi-700-122868-0023 ANNE SHIRLEY
lbi-700-122868-0024 HOW ON EARTH DID YOU GET THERE HE EXCLAIMED
lbi-700-122868-0025 IT WAS CERTAINLY EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO BE DIGNIFIED UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES
lbi-700-122868-0026 WHAT HAS HAPPENED ANNE
lbi-700-122868-0027 ASKED GILBERT TAKING UP HIS OARS
lbi-700-122868-0028 WE WERE PLAYING ELAINE EXPLAINED ANNE FRIGIDLY WITHOUT EVEN LOOKING AT HER RESCUER AND I HAD TO DRIFT DOWN TO CAMELOT IN THE BARGE I MEAN THE FLAT
lbi-700-122868-0029 FOR A MOMENT ANNE HESITATED
lbi-700-122868-0030 HER HEART GAVE A QUICK QUEER LITTLE BEAT
lbi-700-122868-0031 HER RESENTMENT WHICH TO OTHER AND OLDER PEOPLE MIGHT BE AS LAUGHABLE AS ITS CAUSE WAS IN NO WHIT ALLAYED AND SOFTENED BY TIME SEEMINGLY
lbi-700-122868-0032 NO SHE SAID COLDLY I SHALL NEVER BE FRIENDS WITH YOU GILBERT BLYTHE AND I DON'T WANT TO BE
lbi-700-122868-0033 ALL RIGHT
lbi-700-122868-0034 I'LL NEVER ASK YOU TO BE FRIENDS AGAIN ANNE SHIRLEY AND I DON'T CARE EITHER
lbi-700-122868-0035 OF COURSE HE HAD INSULTED HER TERRIBLY BUT STILL
lbi-700-122868-0036 EVERYTHING I DO GETS ME OR MY DEAREST FRIENDS INTO A SCRAPE
lbi-700-122868-0037 ANNE'S PRESENTIMENT PROVED MORE TRUSTWORTHY THAN PRESENTIMENTS ARE APT TO DO
lbi-700-122868-0038 WILL YOU EVER HAVE ANY SENSE ANNE GROANED MARILLA
lbi-700-122868-0039 I DON'T SEE HOW SAID MARILLA
lbi-700-122868-0040 EVER SINCE I CAME TO GREEN GABLES I'VE BEEN MAKING MISTAKES AND EACH MISTAKE HAS HELPED TO CURE ME OF SOME GREAT SHORTCOMING
