lbi-1686-142278-0000 HE WAS GONE
lbi-1686-142278-0001 NO MORE DEEP BLUE SKIES OR CRIMSON AND AMBER TINTS
lbi-1686-142278-0002 SHE SAT BY HERSELF AT THE FIRE WITH UNLIGHTED CANDLES ON THE TABLE BEHIND HER THINKING OVER THE DAY THE HAPPY WALK HAPPY SKETCHING CHEERFUL PLEASANT DINNER AND THE UNCOMFORTABLE MISERABLE WALK IN THE GARDEN
lbi-1686-142278-0003 HERE WAS SHE DISTURBED AND UNHAPPY BECAUSE HER INSTINCT HAD MADE ANYTHING BUT A REFUSAL IMPOSSIBLE WHILE HE NOT MANY MINUTES AFTER HE HAD MET WITH A REJECTION OF WHAT OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN THE DEEPEST HOLIEST PROPOSAL OF HIS LIFE COULD SPEAK AS IF BRIEFS SUCCESS AND ALL ITS SUPERFICIAL CONSEQUENCES OF A GOOD HOUSE CLEVER AND AGREEABLE SOCIETY WERE THE SOLE AVOWED OBJECTS OF HIS DESIRES OH DEAR
lbi-1686-142278-0004 HER MOTHER CAME INTO THE ROOM BEFORE THIS WHIRL OF THOUGHTS WAS ADJUSTED INTO ANYTHING LIKE ORDER
lbi-1686-142278-0005 MISTER HALE SIPPED HIS TEA IN ABSTRACTED SILENCE MARGARET HAD THE RESPONSES ALL TO HERSELF
lbi-1686-142278-0006 SHE FORGOT THAT HE HAD NOT MADE THEM AN OFFER
lbi-1686-142278-0007 MARGARET WAS PREPARING HER MOTHER'S WORSTED WORK AND RATHER SHRINKING FROM THE THOUGHT OF THE LONG EVENING AND WISHING BED TIME WERE COME THAT SHE MIGHT GO OVER THE EVENTS OF THE DAY AGAIN
lbi-1686-142278-0008 MARGARET
lbi-1686-142278-0009 I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING VERY SERIOUS TO US ALL
lbi-1686-142278-0010 VERY SERIOUS TO US ALL
lbi-1686-142278-0011 MISTER LENNOX HAD NEVER HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF HAVING ANY PRIVATE CONVERSATION WITH HER FATHER AFTER HER REFUSAL OR ELSE THAT WOULD INDEED BE A VERY SERIOUS AFFAIR
lbi-1686-142278-0012 BUT SHE SOON FELT IT WAS NOT ABOUT ANYTHING WHICH HAVING ONLY LATELY AND SUDDENLY OCCURRED COULD HAVE GIVEN RISE TO ANY COMPLICATED THOUGHTS THAT HER FATHER WISHED TO SPEAK TO HER
lbi-1686-142278-0013 MISTER HALE DID NOT ANSWER FOR A MINUTE OR TWO
lbi-1686-142278-0014 MARGARET COULD NOT BEAR THE SIGHT OF THE SUSPENSE WHICH WAS EVEN MORE DISTRESSING TO HER FATHER THAN TO HERSELF
lbi-1686-142278-0015 BUT WHY DEAR PAPA DO TELL ME
lbi-1686-142278-0016 BECAUSE I MUST NO LONGER BE A MINISTER IN THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND
lbi-1686-142278-0017 BUT NOTHING TO THE SHOCK SHE RECEIVED FROM MISTER HALE'S LAST SPEECH WHAT COULD HE MEAN
lbi-1686-142278-0018 IT WAS ALL THE WORSE FOR BEING SO MYSTERIOUS
lbi-1686-142278-0019 WHY CAN YOU NO LONGER BE A CLERGYMAN
lbi-1686-142278-0020 SURELY IF THE BISHOP WERE TOLD ALL WE KNOW ABOUT FREDERICK AND THE HARD UNJUST
lbi-1686-142278-0021 MARGARET I WILL TELL YOU ABOUT IT
lbi-1686-142278-0022 I WILL ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THIS ONCE BUT AFTER TO NIGHT LET US NEVER SPEAK OF IT AGAIN
lbi-1686-142278-0023 I CAN MEET THE CONSEQUENCES OF MY PAINFUL MISERABLE DOUBTS BUT IT IS AN EFFORT BEYOND ME TO SPEAK OF WHAT HAS CAUSED ME SO MUCH SUFFERING
lbi-1686-142278-0024 NO NOT DOUBTS AS TO RELIGION NOT THE SLIGHTEST INJURY TO THAT HE PAUSED
lbi-1686-142278-0025 MARGARET SIGHED AS IF STANDING ON THE VERGE OF SOME NEW HORROR
lbi-1686-142278-0026 MARGARET HOW I LOVE THE HOLY CHURCH FROM WHICH I AM TO BE SHUT OUT
lbi-1686-142278-0027 HE COULD NOT GO ON FOR A MOMENT OR TWO
lbi-1686-142278-0028 MARGARET COULD NOT TELL WHAT TO SAY IT SEEMED TO HER AS TERRIBLY MYSTERIOUS AS IF HER FATHER WERE ABOUT TO TURN MAHOMETAN
lbi-1686-142278-0029 THE ONE STAID FOUNDATION OF HER HOME OF HER IDEA OF HER BELOVED FATHER SEEMED REELING AND ROCKING
lbi-1686-142278-0030 HE SWALLOWED DOWN THE DRY CHOKING SOBS WHICH HAD BEEN HEAVING UP FROM HIS HEART HITHERTO AND GOING TO HIS BOOKCASE HE TOOK DOWN A VOLUME WHICH HE HAD OFTEN BEEN READING LATELY AND FROM WHICH HE THOUGHT HE HAD DERIVED STRENGTH TO ENTER UPON THE COURSE IN WHICH HE WAS NOW EMBARKED
lbi-1686-142278-0031 LISTEN DEAR MARGARET SAID HE PUTTING ONE ARM ROUND HER WAIST
lbi-1686-142278-0032 WHEN GOD WILL NOT USE THEE IN ONE KIND YET HE WILL IN ANOTHER
lbi-1686-142278-0033 IF WHEN THOU ART CHARGED WITH CORRUPTING GOD'S WORSHIP FALSIFYING THY VOWS THOU PRETENDEST A NECESSITY FOR IT IN ORDER TO A CONTINUANCE IN THE MINISTRY
lbi-1686-142278-0034 AS HE READ THIS AND GLANCED AT MUCH MORE WHICH HE DID NOT READ HE GAINED RESOLUTION FOR HIMSELF AND FELT AS IF HE TOO COULD BE BRAVE AND FIRM IN DOING WHAT HE BELIEVED TO BE RIGHT BUT AS HE CEASED HE HEARD MARGARET'S LOW CONVULSIVE SOB AND HIS COURAGE SANK DOWN UNDER THE KEEN SENSE OF SUFFERING
lbi-1686-142278-0035 I HAVE BORNE LONG WITH SELF REPROACH THAT WOULD HAVE ROUSED ANY MIND LESS TORPID AND COWARDLY THAN MINE
lbi-1686-142278-0036 HE SHOOK HIS HEAD AS HE WENT ON
lbi-1686-142278-0037 MARGARET I TRIED TO DO IT I TRIED TO CONTENT MYSELF WITH SIMPLY REFUSING THE ADDITIONAL PREFERMENT AND STOPPING QUIETLY HERE STRANGLING MY CONSCIENCE NOW AS I HAD STRAINED IT BEFORE
lbi-1686-142278-0038 GOD FORGIVE ME
lbi-1686-142278-0039 HE ROSE AND WALKED UP AND DOWN THE ROOM SPEAKING LOW WORDS OF SELF REPROACH AND HUMILIATION OF WHICH MARGARET WAS THANKFUL TO HEAR BUT FEW
lbi-1686-142278-0040 MARGARET I RETURN TO THE OLD SAD BURDEN WE MUST LEAVE HELSTONE
lbi-1686-142278-0041 YES

lbi-1686-142278-0043 THEY ARE BUT WHAT I HAVE TRIED UPON MYSELF WITHOUT AVAIL
lbi-1686-142278-0044 THAT WILL BE A TRIAL BUT WORSE FAR WORSE WILL BE THE PARTING FROM MY DEAR PEOPLE
lbi-1686-142278-0045 HE WILL COME TO STAY WITH US TO MORROW
lbi-1686-142278-0046 WAS IT TO BE SO SUDDEN THEN
lbi-1686-142278-0047 WHAT DOES MAMMA SAY
lbi-1686-142278-0048 MARGARET I AM A POOR COWARD AFTER ALL I CANNOT BEAR TO GIVE PAIN

lbi-1686-142278-0051 SHE WILL SHE MUST BE SHOCKED' AS THE FORCE OF THE BLOW RETURNED UPON HERSELF IN TRYING TO REALISE HOW ANOTHER WOULD TAKE IT
lbi-1686-142278-0052 TO MILTON NORTHERN HE ANSWERED WITH A DULL INDIFFERENCE FOR HE HAD PERCEIVED THAT ALTHOUGH HIS DAUGHTER'S LOVE HAD MADE HER CLING TO HIM AND FOR A MOMENT STRIVE TO SOOTHE HIM WITH HER LOVE YET THE KEENNESS OF THE PAIN WAS AS FRESH AS EVER IN HER MIND
lbi-1686-142278-0053 MILTON NORTHERN
lbi-1686-142278-0054 YES SAID HE IN THE SAME DESPONDENT INDIFFERENT WAY
lbi-1686-142278-0055 BUT HE WITH HIS QUICK INTUITIVE SYMPATHY READ IN HER FACE AS IN A MIRROR THE REFLECTIONS OF HIS OWN MOODY DEPRESSION AND TURNED IT OFF WITH AN EFFORT
lbi-1686-142278-0056 YOU SHALL BE TOLD ALL MARGARET

lbi-1686-142278-0060 MARGARET DID DISLIKE IT DID SHRINK FROM IT MORE THAN FROM ANYTHING SHE HAD EVER HAD TO DO IN HER LIFE BEFORE
lbi-1686-142278-0061 MISTER HALE SHOOK HIS HEAD DESPONDINGLY HE PRESSED HER HAND IN TOKEN OF GRATITUDE
lbi-1686-142278-0062 MARGARET WAS NEARLY UPSET AGAIN INTO A BURST OF CRYING
lbi-1686-142278-0063 TO TURN HER THOUGHTS SHE SAID NOW TELL ME PAPA WHAT OUR PLANS ARE

lbi-1686-142278-0071 I CANNOT STAND OBJECTIONS
lbi-1686-142278-0072 THEY MAKE ME SO UNDECIDED
lbi-1686-142278-0073 MISTER HALE CONTINUED A FEW MONTHS AGO WHEN MY MISERY OF DOUBT BECAME MORE THAN I COULD BEAR WITHOUT SPEAKING I WROTE TO MISTER BELL YOU REMEMBER MISTER BELL MARGARET
lbi-1686-142278-0074 NO I NEVER SAW HIM I THINK
lbi-1686-142278-0075 AT ANY RATE HE HAS PROPERTY THERE WHICH HAS VERY MUCH INCREASED IN VALUE SINCE MILTON HAS BECOME SUCH A LARGE MANUFACTURING TOWN
lbi-1686-142278-0076 I DON'T KNOW THAT HE GAVE ME MUCH STRENGTH
lbi-1686-142278-0077 A PRIVATE TUTOR
lbi-1686-142278-0078 SAID MARGARET LOOKING SCORNFUL WHAT IN THE WORLD DO MANUFACTURERS WANT WITH THE CLASSICS OR LITERATURE OR THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF A GENTLEMAN
lbi-1686-142278-0079 OH SAID HER FATHER SOME OF THEM REALLY SEEM TO BE FINE FELLOWS CONSCIOUS OF THEIR OWN DEFICIENCIES WHICH IS MORE THAN MANY A MAN AT OXFORD IS
lbi-1686-142278-0080 SOME WANT THEIR CHILDREN TO BE BETTER INSTRUCTED THAN THEY THEMSELVES HAVE BEEN
lbi-1686-142278-0081 AND IN MILTON MARGARET I SHALL FIND A BUSY LIFE IF NOT A HAPPY ONE AND PEOPLE AND SCENES SO DIFFERENT THAT I SHALL NEVER BE REMINDED OF HELSTONE
lbi-1686-142278-0082 DISCORDANT AS IT WAS WITH ALMOST A DETESTATION FOR ALL SHE HAD EVER HEARD OF THE NORTH OF ENGLAND THE MANUFACTURERS THE PEOPLE THE WILD AND BLEAK COUNTRY THERE WAS THIS ONE RECOMMENDATION IT WOULD BE DIFFERENT FROM HELSTONE AND COULD NEVER REMIND THEM OF THAT BELOVED PLACE
lbi-1686-142278-0083 WHEN DO WE GO
lbi-1686-142278-0084 I DO NOT KNOW EXACTLY
lbi-1686-142278-0085 I WANTED TO TALK IT OVER WITH YOU
lbi-1686-142278-0086 YOU SEE YOUR MOTHER KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT IT YET BUT I THINK IN A FORTNIGHT AFTER MY DEED OF RESIGNATION IS SENT IN I SHALL HAVE NO RIGHT TO REMAIN
lbi-1686-142278-0087 MARGARET WAS ALMOST STUNNED
lbi-1686-142278-0088 BUT SHE RECOVERED HERSELF IMMEDIATELY
lbi-1686-142278-0089 YES PAPA IT HAD BETTER BE FIXED SOON AND DECIDEDLY AS YOU SAY

lbi-1686-142278-0093 YOU MUST NOT DECEIVE YOURSELF INTO DOUBTING THE REALITY OF MY WORDS MY FIXED INTENTION AND RESOLVE
lbi-1686-142278-0094 HE LOOKED AT HER IN THE SAME STEADY STONY MANNER FOR SOME MOMENTS AFTER HE HAD DONE SPEAKING
lbi-1686-142278-0095 THE BLESSING OF GOD BE UPON THEE MY CHILD
lbi-1686-142278-0096 THE NEXT MOMENT SHE FEARED LEST THIS ANSWER TO HIS BLESSING MIGHT BE IRREVERENT WRONG MIGHT HURT HIM AS COMING FROM HIS DAUGHTER AND SHE THREW HER ARMS ROUND HIS NECK
lbi-1686-142278-0097 SHE HEARD HIM MURMUR TO HIMSELF THE MARTYRS AND CONFESSORS HAD EVEN MORE PAIN TO BEAR I WILL NOT SHRINK
lbi-1686-142278-0098 THEY WERE STARTLED BY HEARING MISSUS HALE INQUIRING FOR HER DAUGHTER
lbi-1701-141759-0000 IT WAS LONG SINCE THE ROSTOVS HAD NEWS OF NICHOLAS
lbi-1701-141759-0001 NOT TILL MIDWINTER WAS THE COUNT AT LAST HANDED A LETTER ADDRESSED IN HIS SON'S HANDWRITING
lbi-1701-141759-0002 ON RECEIVING IT HE RAN ON TIPTOE TO HIS STUDY IN ALARM AND HASTE TRYING TO ESCAPE NOTICE CLOSED THE DOOR AND BEGAN TO READ THE LETTER
lbi-1701-141759-0003 EACH TIME THAT THESE HINTS BEGAN TO MAKE THE COUNTESS ANXIOUS AND SHE GLANCED UNEASILY AT THE COUNT AND AT ANNA MIKHAYLOVNA THE LATTER VERY ADROITLY TURNED THE CONVERSATION TO INSIGNIFICANT MATTERS
lbi-1701-141759-0004 BUT FOR GOD'S SAKE BE CAREFUL YOU KNOW HOW IT MAY AFFECT YOUR MAMMA
lbi-1701-141759-0005 NO ON MY TRUE WORD OF HONOR SAID NATASHA CROSSING HERSELF I WON'T TELL ANYONE
lbi-1701-141759-0006 AND SHE RAN OFF AT ONCE TO SONYA
lbi-1701-141759-0007 SHE RUSHED TO SONYA HUGGED HER AND BEGAN TO CRY
lbi-1701-141759-0008 IT'S TRUE THAT ALL YOU WOMEN ARE CRYBABIES REMARKED PETYA PACING THE ROOM WITH LARGE RESOLUTE STRIDES
lbi-1701-141759-0009 YOU ARE ALL BLUBBERERS AND UNDERSTAND NOTHING
lbi-1701-141759-0010 NATASHA SMILED THROUGH HER TEARS
lbi-1701-141759-0011 WHAT NASTY BRUTES THEY ARE
lbi-1701-141759-0012 HOLD YOUR TONGUE PETYA WHAT A GOOSE YOU ARE
lbi-1701-141759-0013 SONYA SMILED DO I REMEMBER NICHOLAS

lbi-1701-141759-0015 NO SHE SHUT HER EYES
lbi-1701-141759-0016 SHE FELT THAT SONYA WAS SPEAKING THE TRUTH THAT THERE WAS SUCH LOVE AS SONYA WAS SPEAKING OF
lbi-1701-141759-0017 SHE BELIEVED IT COULD BE BUT DID NOT UNDERSTAND IT
lbi-1701-141759-0018 SHALL YOU WRITE TO HIM SHE ASKED
lbi-1701-141759-0019 NOW THAT HE WAS ALREADY AN OFFICER AND A WOUNDED HERO WOULD IT BE RIGHT TO REMIND HIM OF HERSELF AND AS IT MIGHT SEEM OF THE OBLIGATIONS TO HER HE HAD TAKEN ON HIMSELF
lbi-1701-141759-0020 I DON'T KNOW
lbi-1701-141759-0021 SONYA SMILED NO
lbi-1701-141759-0022 IT'S BECAUSE SHE WAS IN LOVE WITH THAT FAT ONE IN SPECTACLES THAT WAS HOW PETYA DESCRIBED HIS NAMESAKE THE NEW COUNT BEZUKHOV AND NOW SHE'S IN LOVE WITH THAT SINGER HE MEANT NATASHA'S ITALIAN SINGING MASTER THAT'S WHY SHE'S ASHAMED
lbi-1701-141759-0023 PETYA YOU'RE A STUPID SAID NATASHA
lbi-1701-141759-0024 THE COUNTESS HAD BEEN PREPARED BY ANNA MIKHAYLOVNA'S HINTS AT DINNER
lbi-1701-141759-0025 ON RETIRING TO HER OWN ROOM SHE SAT IN AN ARMCHAIR HER EYES FIXED ON A MINIATURE PORTRAIT OF HER SON ON THE LID OF A SNUFFBOX WHILE THE TEARS KEPT COMING INTO HER EYES
lbi-1701-141759-0026 THE COUNT PUT HIS EAR TO THE KEYHOLE AND LISTENED
lbi-1701-141759-0027 AT FIRST HE HEARD THE SOUND OF INDIFFERENT VOICES THEN ANNA MIKHAYLOVNA'S VOICE ALONE IN A LONG SPEECH THEN A CRY THEN SILENCE THEN BOTH VOICES TOGETHER WITH GLAD INTONATIONS AND THEN FOOTSTEPS
lbi-1701-141759-0028 ANNA MIKHAYLOVNA OPENED THE DOOR
lbi-1701-141759-0029 WHEN SHE HEARD THIS SONYA BLUSHED SO THAT TEARS CAME INTO HER EYES AND UNABLE TO BEAR THE LOOKS TURNED UPON HER RAN AWAY INTO THE DANCING HALL WHIRLED ROUND IT AT FULL SPEED WITH HER DRESS PUFFED OUT LIKE A BALLOON AND FLUSHED AND SMILING PLUMPED DOWN ON THE FLOOR
lbi-1701-141759-0030 THE COUNTESS WAS CRYING
lbi-1701-141759-0031 FROM ALL HE SAYS ONE SHOULD BE GLAD AND NOT CRY
lbi-1701-141759-0032 HOW CHARMINGLY HE DESCRIBES SAID SHE READING THE DESCRIPTIVE PART OF THE LETTER AND WHAT A SOUL
lbi-1701-141759-0033 I ALWAYS SAID WHEN HE WAS ONLY SO HIGH I ALWAYS SAID
lbi-1701-141760-0000 THE PAVLOGRADS HELD FEAST AFTER FEAST CELEBRATING AWARDS THEY HAD RECEIVED FOR THE CAMPAIGN AND MADE EXPEDITIONS TO OLMUTZ TO VISIT A CERTAIN CAROLINE THE HUNGARIAN WHO HAD RECENTLY OPENED A RESTAURANT THERE WITH GIRLS AS WAITRESSES
lbi-1701-141760-0001 THE GUARDS HAD MADE THEIR WHOLE MARCH AS IF ON A PLEASURE TRIP PARADING THEIR CLEANLINESS AND DISCIPLINE
lbi-1701-141760-0002 THE REGIMENTS HAD ENTERED AND LEFT THE TOWN WITH THEIR BANDS PLAYING AND BY THE GRAND DUKE'S ORDERS THE MEN HAD MARCHED ALL THE WAY IN STEP A PRACTICE ON WHICH THE GUARDS PRIDED THEMSELVES THE OFFICERS ON FOOT AND AT THEIR PROPER POSTS
lbi-1701-141760-0003 BORIS HAD BEEN QUARTERED AND HAD MARCHED ALL THE WAY WITH BERG WHO WAS ALREADY IN COMMAND OF A COMPANY
lbi-1701-141760-0004 BORIS DURING THE CAMPAIGN HAD MADE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF MANY PERSONS WHO MIGHT PROVE USEFUL TO HIM AND BY A LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION HE HAD BROUGHT FROM PIERRE HAD BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH PRINCE ANDREW BOLKONSKI THROUGH WHOM HE HOPED TO OBTAIN A POST ON THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF'S STAFF
lbi-1701-141760-0005 BERG AND BORIS HAVING RESTED AFTER YESTERDAY'S MARCH WERE SITTING CLEAN AND NEATLY DRESSED AT A ROUND TABLE IN THE CLEAN QUARTERS ALLOTTED TO THEM PLAYING CHESS
lbi-1701-141760-0006 WELL HOW ARE YOU GOING TO GET OUT OF THAT HE REMARKED
lbi-1701-141760-0007 AT THAT MOMENT THE DOOR OPENED
lbi-1701-141760-0008 DEAR ME HOW YOU HAVE CHANGED
lbi-1701-141760-0009 HE WAS ABOUT TO EMBRACE HIS FRIEND BUT NICHOLAS AVOIDED HIM
lbi-1701-141760-0010 HE WANTED TO PINCH HIM PUSH HIM DO ANYTHING BUT KISS HIM A THING EVERYBODY DID
lbi-1701-141760-0011 BUT NOTWITHSTANDING THIS BORIS EMBRACED HIM IN A QUIET FRIENDLY WAY AND KISSED HIM THREE TIMES
lbi-1701-141760-0012 THEY HAD NOT MET FOR NEARLY HALF A YEAR AND BEING AT THE AGE WHEN YOUNG MEN TAKE THEIR FIRST STEPS ON LIFE'S ROAD EACH SAW IMMENSE CHANGES IN THE OTHER QUITE A NEW REFLECTION OF THE SOCIETY IN WHICH THEY HAD TAKEN THOSE FIRST STEPS
lbi-1701-141760-0013 I DID NOT EXPECT YOU TODAY HE ADDED
lbi-1701-141760-0014 YOU KNOW OF COURSE THAT HIS IMPERIAL HIGHNESS RODE WITH OUR REGIMENT ALL THE TIME SO THAT WE HAD EVERY COMFORT AND EVERY ADVANTAGE
lbi-1701-141760-0015 WHAT RECEPTIONS WE HAD IN POLAND
lbi-1701-141760-0016 WHAT DINNERS AND BALLS I CAN'T TELL YOU
lbi-1701-141760-0017 OH YOU GUARDS SAID ROSTOV I SAY SEND FOR SOME WINE
lbi-1701-141760-0018 HE WENT TO HIS BED DREW A PURSE FROM UNDER THE CLEAN PILLOW AND SENT FOR WINE
lbi-1701-141760-0019 YES AND I HAVE SOME MONEY AND A LETTER TO GIVE YOU HE ADDED
lbi-1701-141760-0020 OH DON'T MENTION IT COUNT I QUITE UNDERSTAND SAID BERG GETTING UP AND SPEAKING IN A MUFFLED AND GUTTURAL VOICE
lbi-1701-141760-0021 GO ACROSS TO OUR HOSTS THEY INVITED YOU ADDED BORIS
lbi-1701-141760-0022 BERG PUT ON THE CLEANEST OF COATS WITHOUT A SPOT OR SPECK OF DUST STOOD BEFORE A LOOKING GLASS AND BRUSHED THE HAIR ON HIS TEMPLES UPWARDS IN THE WAY AFFECTED BY THE EMPEROR ALEXANDER AND HAVING ASSURED HIMSELF FROM THE WAY ROSTOV LOOKED AT IT THAT HIS COAT HAD BEEN NOTICED LEFT THE ROOM WITH A PLEASANT SMILE
lbi-1701-141760-0023 OH DEAR WHAT A BEAST I AM MUTTERED ROSTOV AS HE READ THE LETTER WHY
lbi-1701-141760-0024 WELL HAVE YOU SENT GABRIEL FOR SOME WINE ALL RIGHT LET'S HAVE SOME
lbi-1701-141760-0025 IN THE LETTER FROM HIS PARENTS WAS ENCLOSED A LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION TO BAGRATION WHICH THE OLD COUNTESS AT ANNA MIKHAYLOVNA'S ADVICE HAD OBTAINED THROUGH AN ACQUAINTANCE AND SENT TO HER SON ASKING HIM TO TAKE IT TO ITS DESTINATION AND MAKE USE OF IT
lbi-1701-141760-0026 WHY HAVE YOU THROWN THAT AWAY ASKED BORIS
lbi-1701-141760-0027 IT IS SOME LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION WHAT THE DEVIL DO I WANT IT FOR
lbi-1701-141760-0028 HE LOOKED INTENTLY AND INQUIRINGLY INTO HIS FRIEND'S EYES EVIDENTLY TRYING IN VAIN TO FIND THE ANSWER TO SOME QUESTION
lbi-1701-141760-0029 WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT COUNT I WAS NOT AT ALL ALARMED BECAUSE I KNEW I WAS RIGHT
lbi-1701-141760-0030 I CAME FORWARD BERG STOOD UP AND SHOWED HOW HE PRESENTED HIMSELF WITH HIS HAND TO HIS CAP AND REALLY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT FOR A FACE TO EXPRESS GREATER RESPECT AND SELF COMPLACENCY THAN HIS DID
lbi-1701-141760-0031 WELL HE STORMED AT ME AS THE SAYING IS STORMED AND STORMED AND STORMED
lbi-1701-141760-0032 IT WAS NOT A MATTER OF LIFE BUT RATHER OF DEATH AS THE SAYING IS
lbi-1701-141760-0033 ALBANIANS AND DEVILS AND TO SIBERIA SAID BERG WITH A SAGACIOUS SMILE
lbi-1701-141760-0034 STILL I REMAINED SILENT AND WHAT DO YOU THINK COUNT
lbi-1701-141760-0035 THE NEXT DAY IT WAS NOT EVEN MENTIONED IN THE ORDERS OF THE DAY
lbi-1701-141760-0036 THAT'S THE WAY COUNT SAID BERG LIGHTING HIS PIPE AND EMITTING RINGS OF SMOKE
lbi-1701-141760-0037 YES THAT WAS FINE SAID ROSTOV SMILING
lbi-1701-141760-0038 ROSTOV WAS A TRUTHFUL YOUNG MAN AND WOULD ON NO ACCOUNT HAVE TOLD A DELIBERATE LIE
lbi-1701-141760-0039 HE BEGAN HIS STORY MEANING TO TELL EVERYTHING JUST AS IT HAPPENED BUT IMPERCEPTIBLY INVOLUNTARILY AND INEVITABLY HE LAPSED INTO FALSEHOOD
lbi-1701-141760-0040 PRINCE ANDREW WHO LIKED TO HELP YOUNG MEN WAS FLATTERED BY BEING ASKED FOR HIS ASSISTANCE AND BEING WELL DISPOSED TOWARD BORIS WHO HAD MANAGED TO PLEASE HIM THE DAY BEFORE HE WISHED TO DO WHAT THE YOUNG MAN WANTED
lbi-1701-141760-0041 IN SPITE OF PRINCE ANDREW'S DISAGREEABLE IRONICAL TONE IN SPITE OF THE CONTEMPT WITH WHICH ROSTOV FROM HIS FIGHTING ARMY POINT OF VIEW REGARDED ALL THESE LITTLE ADJUTANTS ON THE STAFF OF WHOM THE NEWCOMER WAS EVIDENTLY ONE ROSTOV FELT CONFUSED BLUSHED AND BECAME SILENT
lbi-1701-141760-0042 BORIS INQUIRED WHAT NEWS THERE MIGHT BE ON THE STAFF AND WHAT WITHOUT INDISCRETION ONE MIGHT ASK ABOUT OUR PLANS
lbi-1701-141760-0043 WE SHALL PROBABLY ADVANCE REPLIED BOLKONSKI EVIDENTLY RELUCTANT TO SAY MORE IN THE PRESENCE OF A STRANGER
lbi-1701-141760-0044 BERG TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO ASK WITH GREAT POLITENESS WHETHER AS WAS RUMORED THE ALLOWANCE OF FORAGE MONEY TO CAPTAINS OF COMPANIES WOULD BE DOUBLED
lbi-1701-141760-0045 I WAS THERE SAID ROSTOV ANGRILY AS IF INTENDING TO INSULT THE AIDE DE CAMP
lbi-1701-141760-0046 WITH A SLIGHTLY CONTEMPTUOUS SMILE HE SAID YES THERE ARE MANY STORIES NOW TOLD ABOUT THAT AFFAIR
lbi-1701-141760-0047 BUT OUR STORIES ARE THE STORIES OF MEN WHO HAVE BEEN UNDER THE ENEMY'S FIRE
lbi-1701-141760-0048 OUR STORIES HAVE SOME WEIGHT NOT LIKE THE STORIES OF THOSE FELLOWS ON THE STAFF WHO GET REWARDS WITHOUT DOING ANYTHING
lbi-1701-141760-0049 HOWEVER HE ADDED RISING YOU KNOW MY NAME AND WHERE TO FIND ME BUT DON'T FORGET THAT I DO NOT REGARD EITHER MYSELF OR YOU AS HAVING BEEN AT ALL INSULTED AND AS A MAN OLDER THAN YOU MY ADVICE IS TO LET THE MATTER DROP
lbi-1701-141760-0050 EXCLAIMED PRINCE ANDREW AND WITH A BOW TO THEM BOTH HE WENT OUT
