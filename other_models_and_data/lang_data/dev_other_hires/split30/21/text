lbi-6455-67803-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY THREE MAY I GO
lbi-6455-67803-0001 THE VERY DAY AFTER THIS OCTAVIA OPENED THE FOURTH TRUNK
lbi-6455-67803-0002 EVIDENTLY SOMETHING HAD HAPPENED OCTAVIA SHE SAID MISTER DUGALD BINNIE IS AT OLDCLOUGH WHO IS HE
lbi-6455-67803-0003 HE IS MY GRAND UNCLE EXPLAINED LUCIA TREMULOUSLY HE HAS A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY
lbi-6455-67803-0004 I DO NOT QUITE UNDERSTAND GRANDMAMMA OCTAVIA SHE SAID
lbi-6455-67803-0005 LAST NIGHT SHE CAME TO MY ROOM TO TALK TO ME AND THIS MORNING SHE CAME AGAIN AND OH
lbi-6455-67803-0006 SHE BROKE OUT INDIGNANTLY HOW COULD SHE SPEAK TO ME IN SUCH A MANNER
lbi-6455-67803-0007 WHAT DID YOU UNDERSTAND
lbi-6455-67803-0008 I AM TO RUN AFTER A MAN WHO DOES NOT CARE FOR ME AND MAKE MYSELF ATTRACTIVE IN THE HOPE THAT HE WILL CONDESCEND TO MARRY ME BECAUSE MISTER BINNIE MAY LEAVE ME HIS MONEY
lbi-6455-67803-0009 DO YOU WONDER THAT IT TOOK EVEN LADY THEOBALD A LONG TIME TO SAY THAT
lbi-6455-67803-0010 WELL REMARKED OCTAVIA YOU WON'T DO IT I SUPPOSE I WOULDN'T WORRY
lbi-6455-67803-0011 OH I ALWAYS KNEW IT I DIDN'T GUESS
lbi-6455-67803-0012 AND SHE SMILED EVER SO FAINTLY
lbi-6455-67803-0013 THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY SHE LOATHES ME SO SHE ADDED
lbi-6455-67803-0014 LUCIA THOUGHT DEEPLY FOR A MOMENT SHE RECOGNIZED ALL AT ONCE SEVERAL THINGS SHE HAD BEEN MYSTIFIED BY BEFORE
lbi-6455-67803-0015 OCTAVIA SMILED A LITTLE AGAIN
lbi-6455-67803-0016 LUCIA SAT THINKING HER HANDS CLASPED TIGHTLY
lbi-6455-67803-0017 I AM GLAD I CAME HERE SHE SAID AT LENGTH
lbi-6455-67803-0018 I THINK I SHALL NEVER BE AFRAID OF HER ANY MORE
lbi-6455-67803-0019 HER DELICATE NOSTRILS WERE DILATED SHE HELD HER HEAD UP HER BREATH CAME FAST THERE WAS A HINT OF EXULTATION IN HER TONE
lbi-6455-67803-0020 SHE WALKED VERY FAST AFTER SHE LEFT THE HOUSE
lbi-6455-67803-0021 BUT IT WAS NOT AGAINST HIM THAT LUCIA'S INDIGNATION WAS AROUSED
lbi-6455-67803-0022 SHE WONDERED IF HE HAD HEARD HER LAST WORDS SHE FANCIED HE HAD
lbi-6455-67803-0023 HE TOOK HOLD OF HER SHAKING LITTLE HAND AND LOOKED DOWN AT HER EXCITED FACE
lbi-6455-67803-0024 I AM ANGRY SHE SAID YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN ME ANGRY BEFORE
lbi-6455-67803-0025 I AM ON MY WAY TO MY TO LADY THEOBALD
lbi-6455-67803-0026 HE HELD HER HAND AS CALMLY AS BEFORE
lbi-6455-67803-0027 WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO SAY TO HER HE ASKED SHE LAUGHED AGAIN
lbi-6455-67803-0028 HE HELD HER HAND RATHER CLOSER
lbi-6455-67803-0029 SHE HAS MADE YOU VERY ANGRY HE SAID
lbi-6455-67803-0030 AND THEN ALMOST BEFORE SHE KNEW WHAT SHE WAS DOING SHE WAS POURING FORTH THE WHOLE OF HER STORY EVEN MORE OF IT THAN SHE HAD TOLD OCTAVIA
lbi-6455-67803-0031 LUCIA HE SAID I WISH YOU WOULD LET ME GO AND TALK WITH LADY THEOBALD YOU SHE SAID WITH A LITTLE START
lbi-6455-67803-0032 YES HE ANSWERED LET ME GO TO HER
lbi-6455-67803-0033 IF YOU WILL SAY YES TO THAT I THINK I CAN PROMISE THAT YOU NEED NEVER BE AFRAID OF HER ANY MORE
lbi-6455-67803-0034 THE FIERCE COLOR DIED OUT OF HER CHEEKS AND THE TEARS RUSHED TO HER EYES
lbi-6455-67803-0035 SHE RAISED HER FACE WITH A PATHETIC LOOK
lbi-6455-67803-0036 I AM DESPERATELY IN LOVE WITH YOU HE ANSWERED IN HIS QUIETEST WAY
lbi-6455-67804-0000 I ACCOMPANY MY GRANDDAUGHTER TO THIS THIS ENTERTAINMENT HER LADYSHIP RESPONDED
lbi-6455-67804-0001 IT IS SCARCELY A JOYOUS OCCASION TO MY MIND
lbi-6455-67804-0002 NO NEED TO DRESS YOURSELF LIKE THAT IF IT ISN'T EJACULATED MISTER BINNIE
lbi-6455-67804-0003 IF I WERE SURE THIS WAS THE SAME MAN I'D GO MYSELF
lbi-6455-67804-0004 WHEN I FIND A FELLOW WHO'S NEITHER KNAVE NOR FOOL I STICK TO HIM BELIEVE I'LL SEND TO FIND OUT
lbi-6455-67804-0005 THE ONLY TIME HE HAD MADE ANY COMMENT UPON HER WAS THE FIRST TIME HE SAW HER IN THE DRESS SHE HAD COPIED FROM OCTAVIA'S NICE GOWN THAT HE BLURTED OUT DIDN'T GET IT HERE I'LL WAGER
lbi-6455-67804-0006 DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT HE SAID GRUFFLY
lbi-6455-67804-0007 NO SHE ANSWERED I AM NOT AFRAID AT ALL
lbi-6455-67804-0008 I SHALL NOT BE AFRAID AGAIN
lbi-6455-67804-0009 IN FACT SHE HAD PERFECTLY CONFOUNDED HER LADYSHIP BY HER DEMEANOR
lbi-6455-67804-0010 I BEG YOU WILL NOT SPEAK TO ME OF THAT AGAIN SHE SAID I WILL NOT LISTEN
lbi-6455-67804-0011 AND TURNING ABOUT SHE WALKED OUT OF THE ROOM
lbi-6455-67804-0012 AND NOTHING MORE HAD BEEN SAID ON THE SUBJECT SINCE
lbi-6455-67804-0013 BEFORE BREAKFAST MISS BELINDA WAS STARTLED BY THE ARRIVAL OF ANOTHER TELEGRAM WHICH RAN AS FOLLOWS
lbi-6455-67804-0014 ARRIVED TO DAY PER RUSSIA BE WITH YOU TOMORROW EVENING
lbi-6455-67804-0015 FRIEND WITH ME MARTIN BASSETT
lbi-6455-67804-0016 WELL REMARKED OCTAVIA I SUPPOSE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN AN ADVANTAGE
lbi-6455-67804-0017 OCTAVIA WAS A MARKED FIGURE UPON THE GROUNDS AT THAT GARDEN PARTY ANOTHER DRESS MY DEAR REMARKED MISSUS BURNHAM
lbi-6455-67804-0018 AND WHAT A CHARMING COLOR SHE HAS I DECLARE SHE IS USUALLY PALER
lbi-6455-67804-0019 PERHAPS WE OWE THIS TO LORD LANSDOWNE
lbi-6455-67804-0020 SHE'S PRETTIER THAN EVER TO DAY AND IS ENJOYING HERSELF
lbi-6455-67804-0021 SHE WAS ENJOYING HERSELF MISTER FRANCIS BAROLD OBSERVED IT RATHER GLOOMILY AS HE STOOD APART
lbi-6455-67804-0022 AND THEN HAD COME LORD LANSDOWNE WHO IN CROSSING THE LAWN TO SHAKE HANDS WITH HIS HOST HAD BEEN OBSERVED TO KEEP HIS EYE FIXED UPON ONE PARTICULAR POINT BURMISTONE HE SAID AFTER HAVING SPOKEN HIS FIRST WORDS WHO IS THAT TALL GIRL IN WHITE
lbi-6455-67804-0023 AND IN TEN MINUTES LADY THEOBALD MISSUS BURNHAM MISTER BAROLD AND DIVERS OTHERS TOO NUMEROUS TO MENTION SAW HIM STANDING AT OCTAVIA'S SIDE EVIDENTLY WITH NO INTENTION OF LEAVING IT
lbi-6455-67804-0024 NOT LONG AFTER THIS FRANCIS BAROLD FOUND HIS WAY TO MISS BELINDA WHO WAS VERY BUSY AND RATHER NERVOUS YOUR NIECE IS EVIDENTLY ENJOYING HERSELF HE REMARKED
lbi-6455-67804-0025 OCTAVIA IS MOST HAPPY TO DAY ANSWERED MISS BELINDA
lbi-6455-67804-0026 VERY FEW PEOPLE UNDERSTAND OCTAVIA SAID MISS BELINDA I'M NOT SURE THAT I FOLLOW ALL HER MOODS MYSELF
lbi-6455-67804-0027 SHE IS NOT AS FRIVOLOUS AS SHE APPEARS TO THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW HER WELL
lbi-6455-67804-0028 BAROLD STOOD GNAWING HIS MUSTACHE AND MADE NO REPLY HE WAS NOT VERY COMFORTABLE
lbi-6455-67804-0029 HE FELT HIMSELF ILL USED BY FATE AND RATHER WISHED HE HAD RETURNED TO LONDON FROM BROADOAKS INSTEAD OF LOITERING IN SLOWBRIDGE
lbi-6455-67804-0030 HE HAD AMUSED HIMSELF AT FIRST BUT IN TIME HE HAD BEEN SURPRISED TO FIND HIS AMUSEMENT LOSE SOMETHING OF ITS ZEST
lbi-6455-67804-0031 IT'S DEUCEDLY BAD FORM ON HIS PART HE SAID MENTALLY WHAT DOES HE MEAN BY IT
lbi-6455-67804-0032 OCTAVIA ON THE CONTRARY DID NOT ASK WHAT HE MEANT BY IT
lbi-6455-67804-0033 WHERE HE EJACULATED I SAY WHAT A NAME
lbi-6455-67804-0034 I HAD NOT OBSERVED IT ANSWERED HER LADYSHIP
lbi-6455-67804-0035 BUT SHE GLARED AT BAROLD AS HE PASSED AND BECKONED TO HIM WHERE IS LUCIA SHE DEMANDED
lbi-6455-67804-0036 I SAW HER WITH BURMISTONE HALF AN HOUR AGO HE ANSWERED COLDLY HAVE YOU ANY MESSAGE FOR MY MOTHER I SHALL RETURN TO LONDON TO MORROW LEAVING HERE EARLY SHE TURNED QUITE PALE
lbi-6455-67804-0037 WHAT HAS HAPPENED SHE ASKED RIGIDLY HE LOOKED SLIGHTLY SURPRISED NOTHING WHATEVER HE REPLIED
lbi-6455-67804-0038 I HAVE REMAINED HERE LONGER THAN I INTENDED
lbi-6455-67804-0039 SHE BEGAN TO MOVE THE MANACLES ON HER RIGHT WRIST
lbi-6455-67804-0040 SHE HAD NOT BROUGHT LUCIA UP UNDER HER OWN EYE FOR NOTHING
