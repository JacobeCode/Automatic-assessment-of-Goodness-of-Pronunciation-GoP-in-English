lbi-6295-64301-0000 ONE WINTER EVENING AS SOON AS HIS WORK WAS OVER FOR THE DAY JOSEPH LOCKED THE DOOR OF HIS SMITHY WASHED HIMSELF WELL PUT ON CLEAN CLOTHES AND TAKING HIS VIOLIN SET OUT FOR TESTBRIDGE MARY WAS EXPECTING HIM TO TEA
lbi-6295-64301-0001 IT WAS THE AFTERNOON OF A HOLIDAY AND SHE HAD CLOSED EARLY
lbi-6295-64301-0002 WAS THERE EVER A HAPPIER MAN THAN JOSEPH THAT NIGHT AS HE STRODE ALONG THE FOOTPATH
lbi-6295-64301-0003 HE PRESSED HIS VIOLIN CASE TO HIS HEART AS IF IT WERE A LIVING THING THAT COULD KNOW THAT HE LOVED IT
lbi-6295-64301-0004 EARTH WAS GONE AND HEAVEN WAS ALL
lbi-6295-64301-0005 BLESSED AM I HERE NOW MY GOD AND BLESSED SHALL I BE THERE THEN
lbi-6295-64301-0006 WHEN HE REACHED THE SUBURBS THE LIGHT OF HOMES WAS SHINING THROUGH CURTAINS OF ALL COLORS
lbi-6295-64301-0007 JUST THEN HE WAS IN NO MOOD TO THINK OF THE SORROWS
lbi-6295-64301-0008 THE NETTLE AND THE DOCK SAID JOSEPH
lbi-6295-64301-0009 HE WAS IN A MOOD FOR MUSIC WAS HE NOT
lbi-6295-64301-0010 HE LAID DOWN HIS VIOLIN AND SEATED HIMSELF WHERE MARY TOLD HIM IN HER FATHER'S ARM CHAIR BY THE FIRE
lbi-6295-64301-0011 LETTY FINDING HERSELF NOT QUITE EQUAL TO THE EMERGENCY CAME IN HER TURN TO CALL MARY SHE WENT AS QUIETLY AS IF SHE WERE LEAVING A TIRESOME VISITOR
lbi-6295-64301-0012 THE MUSIC WAS BROKEN AND JOSEPH LEFT ALONE WITH THE DUMB INSTRUMENTS
lbi-6295-64301-0013 BUT IN HIS HANDS SOLITUDE AND A VIOLIN WERE SURE TO MARRY IN MUSIC
lbi-6295-64301-0014 THEY SAT DOWN AND LISTENED IN SILENCE
lbi-6295-64301-0015 HER HEART SEEMED TO SWELL UP INTO HER THROAT AND IT WAS ALL SHE COULD DO TO KEEP FROM WEEPING
lbi-6295-64301-0016 A LITTLE LONGER AND SHE WAS COMPELLED TO YIELD AND THE SILENT TEARS FLOWED FREELY
lbi-6295-64301-0017 LETTY TOO WAS OVERCOME MORE THAN EVER SHE HAD BEEN BY MUSIC
lbi-6295-64301-0018 LET BUT A MOOD BE STRONG ENOUGH AND THE SOUL CLOTHING ITSELF IN THAT MOOD AS WITH A GARMENT CAN WALK ABROAD AND HAUNT THE WORLD
lbi-6295-64301-0019 IT CRIED ALOUD THAT ETERNITY WAS VERY LONG AND LIKE A GREAT PALACE WITHOUT A QUIET ROOM
lbi-6295-64301-0020 NOR WAS THIS EXACTLY THE SHAPE THE THING TOOK TO THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE MUSICIAN
lbi-6295-64301-0021 I LOVE THEE I LOVE THEE CRIED THE VIOLIN AND THE WORSHIP WAS ENTREATY THAT KNEW NOT ITSELF
lbi-6295-64301-0022 HAST THOU YET TO LEARN THAT THE LOVE OF THE HUMAN IS LOVE IS DIVINE IS BUT A LOWER FORM OF A PART OF THE LOVE OF GOD
lbi-6295-64301-0023 WHEN THOU LOVEST MAN OR WOMAN OR CHILD YEA OR EVEN DOG ARIGHT THEN WILT THOU NO LONGER NEED THAT I TELL THEE HOW GOD AND HIS CHRIST WOULD NOT BE CONTENT WITH EACH OTHER ALONE IN THE GLORIES EVEN OF THE ETERNAL ORIGINAL LOVE BECAUSE THEY COULD CREATE MORE LOVE
lbi-6295-64301-0024 HE THAT LOVETH NOT HIS BROTHER WHOM HE HATH SEEN HOW SHALL HE LOVE GOD WHOM HE HATH NOT SEEN
lbi-6295-64301-0025 A SOB LIKE A BIRD NEW BORN BURST FROM MARY'S BOSOM
lbi-6295-64301-0026 THAT ENCHANTMENT HAD POSSESSED HIM USURPING AS IT WERE THE THRONE OF HIS LIFE AND DISPLACING IT WHEN IT CEASED HE WAS NOT HIS OWN MASTER
lbi-6295-64301-0027 HE STARTED TO CONSCIOUS CONFUSION ONLY NEITHER KNOWING WHERE HE WAS NOR WHAT HE DID
lbi-6295-64301-0028 HOW IT HAPPENED HE NEVER COULD TELL BUT HE BROUGHT DOWN HIS VIOLIN WITH A CRASH AGAINST THE PIANO THEN SOMEHOW STUMBLED AND ALL BUT FELL
lbi-6295-64301-0029 IN THE ACT OF RECOVERING HIMSELF HE HEARD THE NECK OF HIS INSTRUMENT PART FROM THE BODY WITH A TEARING DISCORDANT CRY LIKE THE SOUND OF THE RUIN OF A LIVING WORLD
lbi-6295-64301-0030 HIS VIOLIN WAS BROKEN BUT HIS BEING WAS MADE WHOLE
lbi-6295-64301-0031 HIS TREASURE TAKEN TYPE OF HIS SELF AND A WOMAN GIVEN HIM INSTEAD
lbi-6295-64301-0032 IT'S JUST LIKE HIM HE MURMURED
lbi-6313-66125-0000 YOU'LL ALL BE OVER IF YOU DON'T HAVE A CARE
lbi-6313-66125-0001 LOOKS LIKE A CLUMP OF BUSHES DOWN THERE BUT I AIN'T SURE CAN YOU MAKE IT OUT

lbi-6313-66125-0003 DON'T MOVE AROUND LIE PERFECTLY STILL WARNED THE GUIDE ARE YOU HURT
lbi-6313-66125-0004 AND THAT TUMBLE'S ENOUGH TO KNOCK THE SENSE OUT OF A FULL GROWN MAN
lbi-6313-66125-0005 I COULD NOT THINK OF ALLOWING ANY OF MY CHARGES TO TAKE SO TERRIBLE A RISK AND
lbi-6313-66125-0006 NO I AM THE LIGHTER OF THE TWO URGED TAD
lbi-6313-66125-0007 I AM THE ONE TO GO AFTER WALT IF ANYONE HAS TO I'LL GO DOWN MISTER THOMAS
lbi-6313-66125-0008 MASTER TAD IS RIGHT DECIDED THE GUIDE GAZING AT THE TWO BOYS APPROVINGLY

lbi-6313-66125-0011 BE SURE TO FASTEN HIM SECURELY TO THE LOOP BEFORE YOU GIVE THE SIGNAL TO HAUL UP WARNED THE GUIDE
lbi-6313-66125-0012 ARE YOU READY YES
lbi-6313-66125-0013 HE TILTED HIS HEAD TO LOOK UP
lbi-6313-66125-0014 THE MOVEMENT SENT HIS BODY SWAYING GIDDILY FROM SIDE TO SIDE
lbi-6313-66125-0015 CAUTIOUSLY PLACING A HAND AGAINST THE ROCKS TO STEADY HIMSELF TAD WISELY CONCLUDED THAT HEREAFTER IT WOULD NOT PAY TO BE TOO CURIOUS
lbi-6313-66125-0016 SLOWLY BUT STEADILY THE SLENDER LINE WAS PAID OUT AMID A TENSE SILENCE ON THE PART OF THE LITTLE GROUP AT THE TOP OF THE CANYOU
lbi-6313-66125-0017 AFTER WHAT SEEMED TO THEM HOURS A SHARP CALL FROM THE DEPTHS REACHED THEIR EARS
lbi-6313-66125-0018 LIGE QUICKLY MADE FAST THE LINE TO A TREE
lbi-6313-66125-0019 I SEE HIM CALLED TAD HIS VOICE SOUNDING HOLLOW AND UNNATURAL TO THOSE ABOVE
lbi-6313-66125-0020 HE'S SO FAR TO THE RIGHT OF ME THAT I CAN'T REACH HIM
lbi-6313-66125-0021 LODGED IN THE BRANCHES OF A PINYON TREE I THINK IT IS BUT HE DOESN'T ANSWER ME
lbi-6313-66125-0022 LIGE LEANING OVER THE BRINK WAS ABLE TO FOLLOW THE BOY'S MOVEMENTS BY THE AID OF THE THIN ARC OF LIGHT MADE BY THE TORCH IN TAD'S HAND
lbi-6313-66125-0023 BUT FROM THE CAUTIOUS MOVEMENTS OF THE LIGHT FAR BELOW THEM THE GUIDE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE LAD WAS AT WORK CARRYING OUT HIS PART OF THE TASK OF RESCUE TO THE BEST OF HIS ABILITY
lbi-6313-66125-0024 MEBBY YOU THINK HE'S HAVING SOME SORT OF A PICNIC DOWN THERE EH GLARED LIGE

lbi-6313-66125-0026 SURE THING ANSWERED THE BOY
lbi-6313-66125-0027 NOR WAS HIS SENSE OF SECURITY INCREASED WHEN IN SHIFTING HIS POSITION THE TORCH FELL FROM HIS GRASP THE FAGOTS SCATTERING AS THEY SLIPPED DOWN BETWEEN THE LIMBS OF THE TREE AND WHIRLING IN EVER DIMINISHING CIRCLES UNTIL FINALLY HE HEARD THEM CLATTER ON THE ROCKS BELOW
lbi-6313-66129-0000 HE NO DOUBT WOULD BRING FOOD OF SOME KIND WITH HIM
lbi-6313-66129-0001 WITH A SHOUT THE BOYS DASHED PELL MELL TO MEET THE PACK TRAIN AND FALLING IN BEHIND THE SLOW MOVING BURROS URGED THEM ON WITH DERISIVE SHOUTS AND SUNDRY RESOUNDING SLAPS ON THE ANIMALS FLANKS
lbi-6313-66129-0002 COLD WATER IS THE MOST NOURISHING THING WE'VE TOUCHED SINCE LAST NIGHT
lbi-6313-66129-0003 WE DID NOT IT MUST HAVE COME TO LIFE SOME TIME DURING THE NIGHT AND DUG ITS WAY OUT LAUGHED TAD

lbi-6313-66129-0007 I AM FREE TO ADMIT THAT I AM HUNGRY TOO
lbi-6313-66129-0008 HE BURIED HIS BISCUIT UNDER A LAYER OF JAM OVER WHICH HE SPREAD A THICK COATING OF HONEY
lbi-6313-66129-0009 PRESIDENT BROWN I WITHDRAW MY CRITICISM I OFFER YOU MY HUMBLE APOLOGIES
lbi-6313-66129-0010 I RECKON THERE ARE SMILED THE GUIDE WE ARE IN THE BEAR COUNTRY NOW

lbi-6313-66129-0013 BUT I KNOW AN OLD SETTLER WHO WILL LEND US HIS DOG IF IT IS NOT OUT
lbi-6313-66129-0014 SUPPER HAVING BEEN FINISHED THE PARTY GATHERED ABOUT THE CAMP FIRE FOR THEIR EVENING CHAT AFTER WHICH ADMONISHING STACY TO KEEP WITHIN HIS TENT AND NOT TO GO BORROWING TROUBLE THE BOYS TURNED IN FOR A SOUND SLEEP
lbi-6313-66129-0015 AS YET THEY HAD BEEN UNABLE TO ATTEMPT ANY FANCY RIDING WITH THEIR PONIES OWING TO THE RUGGED NATURE OF THE COUNTRY THROUGH WHICH THEY HAD BEEN JOURNEYING
lbi-6313-66129-0016 THE BOYS WERE NOW ALL ANXIETY TO START WHILE THE PONIES AFTER THEIR SUNDAY REST WERE ALMOST AS FULL OF LIFE AS WERE THEIR OWNERS
lbi-6313-66129-0017 THE LITTLE ANIMALS WERE BECOMING MORE SURE FOOTED EVERY DAY AND NED SAID THAT BEFORE THE TRIP WAS FINISHED JIMMIE WOULD BE ABLE TO WALK A SLACK ROPE
lbi-6313-66129-0018 AN EARLY START WAS MADE SO THAT THE PARTY REACHED THE PROMISED TABLE LANDS SHORTLY BEFORE TEN O'CLOCK IN THE FORENOON
lbi-6313-66129-0019 A TEMPORARY CAMP WAS QUICKLY PITCHED
lbi-6313-66129-0020 THE GREAT GREEN FIELD SURROUNDED ON ALL SIDES BY TALL TREES MADE THE PLACE AN IDEAL ONE FOR THEIR PURPOSE
lbi-6313-66129-0021 IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL RACE THE LITTLE INDIAN PONIES SEEMING TO ENTER THOROUGHLY INTO THE SPIRIT OF THE CONTEST STRETCHING THEMSELVES OUT TO THEIR FULL LENGTHS AND WITH HEADS ON A LEVEL WITH THEIR BACKS FAIRLY FLEW ACROSS THE GREAT PLOT OF GREEN
lbi-6313-66129-0022 ALL AGREED THAT TAD'S SUPERIOR HORSEMANSHIP ALONE HAD WON THE RACE FOR HIM
lbi-6313-66129-0023 GALLOPING INTO CAMP THE BOY FETCHED HIS SOMBRERO WHICH HE CARRIED WELL OUT INTO THE FIELD AND TOSSED AWAY
lbi-6313-66129-0024 THEN BIDDING THE BOYS RIDE UP NEAR THE SPOT TO WATCH HIM HE DREW OFF SOME TEN RODS AND WHEELING SPURRED HIS PONY TO A RUN
lbi-6313-66129-0025 GRASPING THE POMMEL WITH THE LEFT HAND HE APPEARED TO DIVE HEAD FIRST TOWARD THE GROUND
lbi-6313-66129-0026 THEY SAW HIS LONG HAIR ALMOST BRUSH THE GRASS ONE OF HIS HANDS SWEPT DOWN AND UP AND ONCE MORE TAD BUTLER ROSE STANDING IN HIS STIRRUPS UTTERING A COWBOY YELL AS HE WAVED THE SOMBRERO ON HIGH
lbi-6313-66129-0027 THE BOYS HOWLED WITH DELIGHT THAT IS ALL DID SAVE STACY BROWN
lbi-6313-66129-0028 TAD IS AN EXPERIENCED RIDER
lbi-6313-66129-0029 THE FIRST TIME HE RODE SWIFTLY BY IT LEANING OVER TO LOOK AT THE HAT AS HE PASSED HOLDING TO THE POMMEL FIRMLY WITH HIS LEFT HAND
lbi-6313-66129-0030 WHAT'S THAT FOR DEMANDED NED WONDERINGLY
lbi-6313-66129-0031 HAT TOO CLOSE TO ME I COULDN'T GET IT EXPLAINED CHUNKY THE BOYS ROARED
lbi-6313-66129-0032 WHY DON'T YOU MOVE THE PONY
lbi-6313-66129-0033 ONCE MORE STACY APPROACHED THE SOMBRERO HIS PONY RUNNING WELL AND AS HE DREW NEAR IT THEY SAW HIM RISE IN HIS SADDLE JUST AS TAD BUTLER HAD DONE A FEW MINUTES BEFORE
lbi-6313-66129-0034 AT THE MOMENT WHEN HE FREED HIS LEFT FOOT FROM THE STIRRUP HE THREW HIS BODY SHARPLY TO THE RIGHT REACHING FOR THE HAT WITHOUT TAKING THE PRECAUTION TO GRASP THE POMMEL
lbi-6313-66129-0035 AS A RESULT INSTEAD OF STOPPING WHEN HE REACHED THE HAT THE BOY KEPT ON GOING
lbi-6313-76958-0000 CHAPTER FOUR THE FIRST NIGHT IN CAMP
lbi-6313-76958-0001 EVEN IF I CAN'T SING I CAN BEAT THAT
lbi-6313-76958-0002 NOT ON THE RANGE WHY NOT DEMANDED THE BOY
lbi-6313-76958-0003 A LOUD LAUGH FOLLOWED AT CHUNKY'S EXPENSE
lbi-6313-76958-0004 THE PONY DID MOST OF IT ADMITTED THE LAD I JUST GAVE HIM HIS HEAD AND THAT'S ALL THERE WAS TO IT
lbi-6313-76958-0005 WALTER HAD GONE OUT WITH THE SECOND GUARD AND THE OTHERS HAD GATHERED AROUND THE CAMP FIRE FOR THEIR NIGHTLY STORY TELLING
lbi-6313-76958-0006 NONE OF YOU WILL BE FIT FOR DUTY TO MORROW
lbi-6313-76958-0007 WE'VE GOT A HARD DRIVE BEFORE US AND EVERY MAN MUST BE FIT AS A FIDDLE
lbi-6313-76958-0008 HUMPH GRUNTED CURLEY ADAMS
lbi-6313-76958-0009 THE COWBOY DID THIS VERY THING BUT WITHIN AN HOUR HE FOUND HIMSELF ALONE THE OTHERS HAVING TURNED IN ONE BY ONE
lbi-6313-76958-0010 THE LADS FOUND THAT A PAIR OF BLANKETS HAD BEEN ASSIGNED TO EACH OF THEM WITH AN ORDINARY WAGON SHEET DOUBLED FOR A TARPAULIN
lbi-6313-76958-0011 THESE THEY SPREAD OUT ON THE GROUND USING BOOTS WRAPPED IN COATS FOR PILLOWS
lbi-6313-76958-0012 STACY BROWN PROVED THE ONLY GRUMBLER IN THE LOT DECLARING THAT HE COULD NOT SLEEP A WINK ON SUCH A BED AS THAT
lbi-6313-76958-0013 THE HORSES OF THE OUTFIT SAVE THOSE THAT WERE ON NIGHT DUTY AND TWO OR THREE OTHERS THAT HAD DEVELOPED A HABIT OF STRAYING HAD BEEN TURNED LOOSE EARLY IN THE EVENING FOR ANIMALS ON THE TRAIL ARE SELDOM STAKED DOWN
lbi-6313-76958-0014 IN SPITE OF THEIR HARD COUCHES THE PONY RIDERS SLEPT SOUNDLY EVEN PROFESSOR ZEPPLIN HIMSELF NEVER WAKING THE WHOLE NIGHT THROUGH
lbi-6313-76958-0015 STACY GRUMBLED TURNED OVER AND WENT TO SLEEP AGAIN
lbi-6313-76958-0016 YOU WON'T BE SO FAST TO WAKE UP HARD WORKING COWBOYS AFTER THAT I RECKON
lbi-6313-76958-0017 LUMPY BATES CAME RUNNING TOWARD HIM NOT DARING TO CALL OUT FOR FEAR OF WAKING THE CAMP
lbi-6313-76958-0018 HI THERE HISSED LUMPY FILLED WITH INDIGNATION THAT ANYONE SHOULD ATTEMPT TO MOUNT A PONY FROM THE RIGHT SIDE
lbi-6313-76958-0019 STACY BROWN'S LEFT LEG SWUNG OVER THE SADDLE
lbi-6313-76958-0020 WHERE ARE THEY ASKED THE BOY
lbi-6313-76958-0021 KEEP A GOING AND IF YOU'RE LUCKY YOU'LL RUN PLUMB INTO THEM WAS THE JEERING ANSWER AS THE SLEEPY COWMEN SPURRED THEIR PONIES ON TOWARD CAMP MUTTERING THEIR DISAPPROVAL OF TAKING ALONG A BUNCH OF BOYS ON A CATTLE DRIVE
lbi-6313-76958-0022 ALMOST BEFORE THE ECHOES OF HIS VOICE HAD DIED AWAY A SHRILL VOICE PIPED UP FROM THE TAIL END OF THE CHUCK WAGON
lbi-6313-76958-0023 GRUB PI LE GRUB PI LE
lbi-6313-76958-0024 WHO IS THE WRANGLER THIS MORNING ASKED THE FOREMAN GLANCING ABOUT AT HIS MEN
lbi-6313-76958-0025 A WRANGLER'S A WRANGLER ANSWERED BIG FOOT STOLIDLY
lbi-6313-76958-0026 HE'S A FELLOW WHO'S ALL THE TIME MAKING TROUBLE ISN'T HE ASKED STACY INNOCENTLY
lbi-6313-76958-0027 OH NO THIS KIND OF A WRANGLER ISN'T LAUGHED THE FOREMAN
lbi-6313-76958-0028 HE'S A TROUBLE CURER NOT A TROUBLEMAKER EXCEPT FOR HIMSELF
lbi-6313-76958-0029 PONG TELL THE YOUNG GENTLEMEN WHAT WOULD BECOME OF YOU IF YOU WERE TO SERVE BAD MEALS TO THIS OUTFIT OF COWPUNCHERS
lbi-6313-76958-0030 HOW ASKED TAD
lbi-6313-76958-0031 WE HAD BETTER START THE DRIVE THIS MORNING
lbi-6319-275224-0000 WHAT A FUSS IS MADE ABOUT YOU MY DEAR LITTLE FRIENDS
lbi-6319-275224-0001 YOU SURELY CANNOT SUPPOSE THAT IN A NATURAL STATE YOU WOULD BE FORCED TO CLIMB REGULARLY UP ONE TALL BARE STICK SUCH AS I SEE YOU UPON NOW
lbi-6319-275224-0002 YOUR COUSIN THE WILD CONVOLVULUS WHOM I LEFT IN THE FIELDS THIS MORNING DOES NO SUCH THING I ASSURE YOU
lbi-6319-275224-0003 MY YOUNG PLANTS REQUIRE HEAT OR THEY WOULD NOT LIVE AND THE POTS WE ARE KEPT IN PROTECT US FROM THOSE CRUEL WIRE WORMS WHO DELIGHT TO DESTROY OUR ROOTS
lbi-6319-275224-0004 WHY NOT ALLOW YOUR SILVER TUFTS TO LUXURIATE IN A NATURAL MANNER
lbi-6319-275224-0005 STILL THE ROSE TREE STOOD OUT THAT THERE MUST BE SOME GREAT ADVANTAGES IN A GARDENER'S CARE FOR SHE COULD NOT PRETEND TO BE IGNORANT OF HER OWN SUPERIORITY TO ALL HER WILD RELATIONS IN THE WOODS
lbi-6319-275224-0006 THEN THE WIND TOOK ANOTHER FROLIC ROUND THE GARDEN AND MADE UP TO THE LARGE WHITE LILY INTO WHOSE REFINED EAR HE WHISPERED A DOUBT AS TO THE NECESSITY OR ADVANTAGE OF HER THICK POWERFUL STEM BEING PROPPED UP AGAINST A STUPID UGLY STICK
lbi-6319-275224-0007 HE REALLY GRIEVED TO SEE IT
lbi-6319-275224-0008 DID THAT LOVELY CREATURE SUPPOSE THAT NATURE WHO HAD DONE SO MUCH FOR HER THAT THE FAME OF HER BEAUTY EXTENDED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD HAD YET LEFT HER SO WEAK AND FEEBLE THAT SHE COULD NOT SUPPORT HERSELF IN THE POSITION MOST CALCULATED TO GIVE HER EASE AND PLEASURE
lbi-6319-275224-0009 INDEED NOT A FLOWER ESCAPED HIS MISCHIEVOUS SUGGESTIONS
lbi-6319-275224-0010 ECHOED THE FLOWERS TREMULOUSLY AS WITH A SORT OF FEARFUL PLEASURE THEY AWAITED HIS APPROACH
lbi-6319-275224-0011 MAKING A SORT OF EDDYING CIRCUIT ROUND THE GARDEN HE KNOCKED OVER THE CONVOLVULUS POLE TORE THE STRIPS FROM THE STICK THAT HELD UP THE WHITE LILY LOOSED ALL THE CARNATION FLOWERS FROM THEIR FASTENINGS BROKE THE ROSE TREE DOWN AND LEVELLED THE SWEET PEAS TO THE GROUND
lbi-6319-275224-0012 MEANWHILE HOW FARED IT WITH THE FLOWERS
lbi-6319-275224-0013 OH THAT SHE WERE ONCE MORE CLIMBING UP THE FRIENDLY FIR POLE
lbi-6319-275224-0014 THE HONEYSUCKLE ESCAPED NO BETTER AND THE CARNATION WAS READY TO DIE OF VEXATION AT FINDING THAT HER COVETED FREEDOM HAD LEVELLED HER TO THE DIRT
lbi-6319-275224-0015 BEFORE THE DAY CLOSED THE GARDENER CAME WHISTLING FROM HIS FARM WORK TO LOOK OVER HIS PRETTY CHARGES
lbi-6319-275224-0016 BUT FOR THE SIGHT THAT AWAITED HIM HE WAS NOT PREPARED AT ALL
lbi-6319-275224-0017 WEEDS MEANWHILE SPRANG UP AND A DREARY CONFUSION REIGNED IN THE ONCE ORDERLY AND BRILLIANT LITTLE GARDEN
lbi-6319-275224-0018 THE MISTRESS HAD RETURNED AND THE YOUNG LADY WAS WITH HER AND HURRIED AT ONCE TO HER FAVOURITE GARDEN
lbi-6319-275224-0019 IN THIS POSITION SHE REMAINED UNTIL A GENTLE HAND WAS LAID UPON HER SHOULDER
lbi-6319-275224-0020 I AM NOT THINKING ABOUT THE GARDEN MAMMA REPLIED THE YOUNG GIRL WITHOUT LIFTING UP HER FACE WE CAN PLANT NEW FLOWERS AND TIE UP EVEN SOME OF THESE AFRESH
lbi-6319-57405-0000 IN THOSE VERY EARLY TIMES THERE WAS A MAN NAMED DEUCALION AND HE WAS THE SON OF PROMETHEUS
lbi-6319-57405-0001 AFTER JUPITER HAD BOUND PROMETHEUS ON MOUNT CAUCASUS AND HAD SENT DISEASES AND CARES INTO THE WORLD MEN BECAME VERY VERY WICKED
lbi-6319-57405-0002 THESE MEN HE SAID TO HIS MIGHTY COMPANY ARE NOTHING BUT A SOURCE OF TROUBLE
lbi-6319-57405-0003 BUT MEN KEPT ON FIGHTING AND ROBBING EVEN WHILE THE RAIN WAS POURING DOWN AND THE SEA WAS COMING UP OVER THE LAND
lbi-6319-57405-0004 NO ONE BUT DEUCALION THE SON OF PROMETHEUS WAS READY FOR SUCH A STORM
lbi-6319-57405-0005 THE DAY IS COMING SAID PROMETHEUS WHEN JUPITER WILL SEND A FLOOD TO DESTROY MANKIND FROM THE EARTH
lbi-6319-57405-0006 BUT DEUCALION AND PYRRHA WERE VERY SAD FOR THEY KNEW THAT THEY WERE THE ONLY PERSONS WHO WERE LEFT ALIVE IN ALL THE LAND
lbi-6319-57405-0007 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH HE ASKED
lbi-6319-57405-0008 WE SHOULD LIKE ABOVE ALL THINGS SAID DEUCALION TO SEE THIS LAND FULL OF PEOPLE ONCE MORE FOR WITHOUT NEIGHBORS AND FRIENDS THE WORLD IS A VERY LONELY PLACE INDEED
lbi-6319-57405-0009 GO ON DOWN THE MOUNTAIN SAID MERCURY AND AS YOU GO CAST THE BONES OF YOUR MOTHER OVER YOUR SHOULDERS BEHIND YOU AND WITH THESE WORDS HE LEAPED INTO THE AIR AND WAS SEEN NO MORE
lbi-6319-57405-0010 WHAT DID HE MEAN ASKED PYRRHA
lbi-6319-57405-0011 SURELY I DO NOT KNOW SAID DEUCALION
lbi-6319-57405-0012 WHEN AT LAST THEY REACHED THE PLAIN THEY FOUND THEMSELVES AT THE HEAD OF A NOBLE COMPANY OF HUMAN BEINGS ALL EAGER TO SERVE THEM
