# Automatic assessment of Goodness of Pronunciation in English

## This repository contains files, models and results connected to the project entitled "Automatic Assessment of Goodness of Pronunciation in English". The main goal of this project done as an engineering thesis was to train ASR models compatible with the Goodness of Pronunciation (GoP) algorithm and test (or improve if it is possible) the classic formulation of Goodness of Pronunciation with the use of Kaldi toolkit. Also, project involved a full literature study about related topics.

## Introduction
This repository contains files and informations about project created as Engineering Thesis. 

Main goal of this project and research is Automatic Assessment with Goodnees of Pronuanciaction algorithm in English language. This project was based on Kaldi toolit and as in solution used there, the solution proposed in (1) was used as reference in implementation and training.

In course of this project with use of Kaldi toolit a few ASR models was trained and tested with GoP algorithm.



Program is created as Engineering Thesis by [JacobeCode](https://github.com/JacobeCode).
