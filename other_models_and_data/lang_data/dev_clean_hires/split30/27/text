lbi-7976-105575-0000 GRANT WAS ONLY A FEW MILES AWAY BUT ALTHOUGH COMMANDER IN CHIEF HE KNEW NOTHING OF THE HARDEST FOUGHT BATTLE OF THE CIVIL WAR UNTIL IT WAS OVER
lbi-7976-105575-0001 MY OWN REGIMENT WAS IN THE ADVANCE
lbi-7976-105575-0002 OUR BRIGADE WAS FEARFULLY OUTNUMBERED
lbi-7976-105575-0003 THERE WERE NO BREASTWORKS YET THAT ONE LITTLE BRIGADE OF HAMILTON'S DIVISION STOOD THERE IN THE OPEN AND REPULSED ASSAULT AFTER ASSAULT
lbi-7976-105575-0004 NOT BALAKLAVA NOR THE ALMA SAW SUCH FIGHTING IT WAS A DUEL TO THE DEATH
lbi-7976-105575-0005 NO BATTERY IN THE WHOLE FOUR YEARS WAR LOST SO MANY MEN IN SO SHORT A TIME
lbi-7976-105575-0006 ONE DARING REBEL WAS SHOT DOWN AND BAYONETED CLEAR BEHIND THE LINE OF COMPANY B WHERE HE HAD BROKEN THROUGH TO SEIZE THE FLAG OF MY REGIMENT
lbi-7976-105575-0007 THAT NIGHT THE ENEMY SLIPPED AWAY LEAVING HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF HIS DEAD AND WOUNDED ON THE FIELD
lbi-7976-105575-0008 WITH A FEW LANTERNS OUR MEN THEN WENT ABOUT AND TRIED TO GATHER UP THE WOUNDED THE DEAD WERE LEFT TILL MORNING
lbi-7976-105575-0009 IT WAS NOT A QUESTION WHO WAS DEAD OR WOUNDED BUT WHO WAS NOT
lbi-7976-105575-0010 FIFTEEN OFFICERS OF OUR LITTLE HALF REGIMENT WERE DEAD OR WOUNDED
lbi-7976-105575-0011 I REMAINED AWAKE ALL NIGHT TALKING WITH A COMRADE WHO SHARED MY BLANKET WITH ME POOR JIMMY KING
lbi-7976-105575-0012 HE SURVIVED THE WAR ONLY TO BE MURDERED LATER ON A PLANTATION IN MISSISSIPPI
lbi-7976-105575-0013 WHEN MORNING CAME THE FIRING OPENED AND FOR ALL THAT DAY THE BATTLE RAGED FIERCELY AT THE LEFT AND CENTER LEFT WE GETTING THE WORST OF IT TOO
lbi-7976-105575-0014 THAT EVENING AN ORDER CAME FOR US HAMILTON'S DIVISION TO ASSAULT THE ENEMY'S LEFT FLANK AT MIDNIGHT
lbi-7976-105575-0015 UNDER THE SAME QUIET MOONLIGHT AND ONLY SIX HUNDRED YARDS AWAY FROM US ALSO LAY THE VICTORIOUS REBEL ARMY
lbi-7976-105575-0016 ONCE IN THE NIGHT I SLIPPED AWAY FROM THE BIVOUAC AND HURRIED TO THE OLD TISHIMINGO HOTEL TO SEE A LIEUTENANT OF MY COMPANY WHO HAD BEEN SHOT THROUGH THE BREAST
lbi-7976-105575-0017 I COULD NOT HELP MY FRIEND
lbi-7976-105575-0018 GO BACK TO THE REGIMENT HE SAID SMILING ALL WILL BE NEEDED
lbi-7976-105575-0019 MY FRIEND WITH MANY OTHERS WAS BEING CARRIED OUT TO DIE ELSEWHERE
lbi-7976-105575-0020 I HASTENED BACK TO THE LINES
lbi-7976-105575-0021 THE CLOUD OF REBELS WE HAD SEEN DIVIDED ITSELF INTO THREE COLUMNS
lbi-7976-105575-0022 A PERFECT BLAZE OF CLOSE RANGE MUSKETRY TOO MOWED THEM DOWN LIKE GRASS
lbi-7976-105575-0023 THEY LAY IN HEAPS OF DOZENS EVEN CLOSE UP TO THE WORKS
lbi-7976-105575-0024 THAT NIGHT I STOOD GUARD UNDER AN OAK TREE ON THE BATTLEFIELD AMONG THE UNBURIED DEAD
lbi-7976-105575-0025 INDEED WE OF THE RANK AND FILE HAD LITTLE CONFIDENCE IN GRANT IN THOSE DAYS
lbi-7976-105575-0026 ROSECRANS PROTESTED IT WAS IN VAIN
lbi-7976-105575-0027 IT REQUIRED MONTHS AND GREAT EVENTS TO MAKE GRANT THE HERO OF THE ARMY WHICH HE AFTERWARD BECAME
lbi-7976-105575-0028 FOR SOME REASON THE DEAD AT HATCHIE BRIDGE WERE NOT BURIED
lbi-7976-105575-0029 A WEEK AFTER THE BATTLE MY BROTHER RODE BY THERE ON A CAVALRY EXPEDITION AND MADE THE HORRIBLE DISCOVERY THAT HOGS WERE EATING UP THE BODIES OF OUR DEAD HEROES THAT TOO WAS WAR
lbi-7976-110124-0000 LONG AGO THERE LIVED A MERCHANT WHO HAD THREE DAUGHTERS
lbi-7976-110124-0001 EVERY YEAR AT A CERTAIN DAY OF A CERTAIN MONTH HE WENT AWAY TO A DISTANT CITY TO COLLECT MONEY ON AN ACCOUNT
lbi-7976-110124-0002 HOW DO YOU KNOW ASKED THEIR FATHER I AM OLDER AND WISER THAN YOU ARE AND I KNOW THAT THERE ARE MANY EVILS WHICH MIGHT COME UPON YOU
lbi-7976-110124-0003 WHEN IT WAS EVENING HE LED HIS BAND INTO A NEARBY STREET AND IN HIS DISGUISE APPROACHED THE MERCHANT'S HOUSE HE KNOCKED AT THE DOOR
lbi-7976-110124-0004 HAVE PITY UPON A POOR UNFORTUNATE ONE HE CALLED OUT
lbi-7976-110124-0005 LET ME ENTER I PRAY YOU TO PASS THE NIGHT UNDER YOUR ROOF
lbi-7976-110124-0006 IT'S SURELY A TERRIBLE STORM OUTSIDE SAID THE MERCHANT'S ELDEST DAUGHTER AS THE WIND RATTLED THE TILES OF THE ROOF AND THE RAIN BEAT IN TORRENTS AGAINST THE DOORS AND WINDOWS
lbi-7976-110124-0007 HE IS OLD AS WELL AS POOR SHE SAID
lbi-7976-110124-0008 IF WE DECIDE TO SHOW MERCY TO THIS POOR BEGGAR IT IS NOT FOR YOU TO OPPOSE IT
lbi-7976-110124-0009 BUI WE SHOULD NOT FORGET OUR PROMISE TO OUR FATHER CRIED THE YOUNGEST DAUGHTER
lbi-7976-110124-0010 HOWEVER IN SPITE OF ALL SHE COULD SAY THE ELDER SISTERS OPENED THE DOOR AND ADMITTED THE BEGGAR
lbi-7976-110124-0011 IT IS A FEARFUL NIGHT TO SEND AWAY A BEGGAR SAID THE ELDEST SISTER WHILE THEY WERE EATING
lbi-7976-110124-0012 WHILE THEY WERE TALKING THE BEGGAR HAD TAKEN THE APPLES WHICH THE GIRLS WERE TO EAT FOR DESSERT AND HAD SPRINKLED A SLEEPING POWDER OVER THEM
lbi-7976-110124-0013 THE TWO ELDEST ATE THEIR APPLES BUT THE YOUNGEST COULD NOT EAT THAT NIGHT SHE THREW THE APPLE AWAY
lbi-7976-110124-0014 SHE DID NOT STIR AND HE KNEW THAT THE SLEEPING POWDER HAD THOROUGHLY DONE ITS WORK
lbi-7976-110124-0015 THEN SHE HEARD HIM GO DOWN THE STAIRWAY AND UNBOLT THE HEAVY DOORS WHICH LED INTO THE STORE
lbi-7976-110124-0016 IT WAS THE YOUNGEST ONE WHO DECEIVED ME CRIED THE ROBBER CHIEFTAIN
lbi-7976-110124-0017 PERHAPS YOU CAN OUTWIT HER YET CRIED ANOTHER
lbi-7976-110124-0018 THE MERCHANT'S DAUGHTER AT FIRST DID NOT ANSWER BUT AS HE KEPT ON CALLING TO HER SHE FINALLY ASKED HIM WHAT IT WAS THAT HE WANTED
lbi-7976-110124-0019 I PROMISE YOU I WILL DO YOU NO HARM
lbi-7976-110124-0020 YOU SHALL NOT COME INTO MY FATHER'S HOUSE
lbi-7976-110124-0021 PASS THE CHARM OUT TO ME THEN SAID THE ROBBER
lbi-7976-110124-0022 WHEN SHE RETURNED HIS HAND WAS STICKING THROUGH THE HOLE IN THE DOOR
lbi-7976-110124-0023 THE CRIES AND CURSES OF THE ROBBERS FILLED THE AIR
lbi-7976-110124-0024 THEY TRIED IN VAIN TO BREAK DOWN THE GREAT DOORS
lbi-7976-110124-0025 ALL MY WORRIES ABOUT YOU WERE FOOLISH
lbi-7976-110523-0000 HE HAD LITTLE ENOUGH TO BREAK OR BITE AND ONCE WHEN THERE WAS A GREAT FAMINE IN THE LAND HE COULD HARDLY PROCURE EVEN HIS DAILY BREAD AND AS HE LAY THINKING IN HIS BED ONE NIGHT HE SIGHED AND SAID TO HIS WIFE WHAT WILL BECOME OF US
lbi-7976-110523-0001 HOW CAN WE FEED OUR CHILDREN WHEN WE HAVE NO MORE THAN WE CAN EAT OURSELVES
lbi-7976-110523-0002 OH YOU SIMPLETON SAID SHE THEN WE MUST ALL FOUR DIE OF HUNGER YOU HAD BETTER PLANE THE COFFINS FOR US
lbi-7976-110523-0003 BUT SHE LEFT HIM NO PEACE TILL HE CONSENTED SAYING AH BUT I SHALL MISS THE POOR CHILDREN
lbi-7976-110523-0004 AND AS SOON AS THEIR PARENTS HAD GONE TO SLEEP HE GOT UP PUT ON HIS COAT AND UNBARRING THE BACK DOOR WENT OUT
lbi-7976-110523-0005 AH FATHER SAID HANSEL I AM LOOKING AT MY WHITE CAT SITTING UPON THE ROOF OF THE HOUSE AND TRYING TO SAY GOOD BYE
lbi-7976-110523-0006 BUT IN REALITY HANSEL WAS NOT LOOKING AT A CAT BUT EVERY TIME HE STOPPED HE DROPPED A PEBBLE OUT OF HIS POCKET UPON THE PATH
lbi-7976-110523-0007 BUT HER HUSBAND FELT HEAVY AT HEART AND THOUGHT IT WERE BETTER TO SHARE THE LAST CRUST WITH THE CHILDREN
lbi-7976-110523-0008 EARLY IN THE MORNING THE STEPMOTHER CAME AND PULLED THEM OUT OF BED AND GAVE THEM EACH A SLICE OF BREAD WHICH WAS STILL SMALLER THAN THE FORMER PIECE
lbi-7976-110523-0009 WE ARE GOING INTO THE FOREST TO HEW WOOD AND IN THE EVENING WHEN WE ARE READY WE WILL COME AND FETCH YOU AGAIN
lbi-7976-110523-0010 HANSEL THOUGHT THE ROOF TASTED VERY NICE AND SO HE TORE OFF A GREAT PIECE WHILE GRETHEL BROKE A LARGE ROUND PANE OUT OF THE WINDOW AND SAT DOWN QUITE CONTENTEDLY
lbi-7976-110523-0011 COME IN AND STOP WITH ME AND NO HARM SHALL COME TO YOU AND SO SAYING SHE TOOK THEM BOTH BY THE HAND AND LED THEM INTO HER COTTAGE
lbi-7976-110523-0012 THE OLD WOMAN BEHAVED VERY KINDLY TO THEM BUT IN REALITY SHE WAS A WICKED OLD WITCH WHO WAY LAID CHILDREN AND BUILT THE BREADHOUSE IN ORDER TO ENTICE THEM IN BUT AS SOON AS THEY WERE IN HER POWER SHE KILLED THEM COOKED AND ATE THEM AND MADE A GREAT FESTIVAL OF THE DAY
lbi-7976-110523-0013 THEN SHE TOOK UP HANSEL WITH HER ROUGH HAND AND SHUT HIM UP IN A LITTLE CAGE WITH A LATTICE DOOR AND ALTHOUGH HE SCREAMED LOUDLY IT WAS OF NO USE
lbi-7976-110523-0014 GRETHEL BEGAN TO CRY BUT IT WAS ALL USELESS FOR THE OLD WITCH MADE HER DO AS SHE WANTED
lbi-7976-110523-0015 GRETHEL SHE CRIED IN A PASSION GET SOME WATER QUICKLY BE HANSEL FAT OR LEAN THIS MORNING I WILL KILL AND COOK HIM
lbi-7976-110523-0016 DEAR GOOD GOD HELP US NOW SHE PRAYED
lbi-7976-110523-0017 CREEP IN SAID THE WITCH AND SEE IF IT IS HOT ENOUGH AND THEN WE WILL PUT IN THE BREAD BUT SHE INTENDED WHEN GRETHEL GOT IN TO SHUT UP THE OVEN AND LET HER BAKE SO THAT SHE MIGHT EAT HER AS WELL AS HANSEL
lbi-7976-110523-0018 SEE I COULD EVEN GET IN MYSELF
lbi-7976-110523-0019 AND SHE GOT UP AND PUT HER HEAD INTO THE OVEN
lbi-7976-110523-0020 AND NOW AS THERE WAS NOTHING TO FEAR THEY WENT BACK TO THE WITCH'S HOUSE WHERE IN EVERY CORNER WERE CASKETS FULL OF PEARLS AND PRECIOUS STONES
lbi-7976-110523-0021 THEN THEY BEGAN TO RUN AND RUSHING INTO THE HOUSE THEY FELL UPON THEIR FATHER'S NECK
