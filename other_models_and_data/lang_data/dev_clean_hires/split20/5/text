lbi-2035-152373-0000 THROUGHOUT THIS CENTURY THE POWER OF THE CHURCH WAS CONSTANTLY ON THE INCREASE AND IS VISIBLE IN MANY IMPORTANT CHANGES
lbi-2035-152373-0001 THE ANCESTORS OF THE PRESENT PRETENDER CONGAL SURNAMED THE SQUINT EYED HAD TWICE RECEIVED AND CHERISHED THE LICENTIOUS BARDS WHEN UNDER THE BAN OF TARA AND HIS POPULARITY WITH THAT STILL POWERFUL ORDER WAS ONE PROP OF HIS AMBITION
lbi-2035-152373-0002 IT IS PRETTY CLEAR ALSO THAT THE LAST RALLY OF DRUIDISM AGAINST CHRISTIANITY TOOK PLACE BEHIND HIS BANNER ON THE PLAIN OF MOIRA
lbi-2035-152373-0003 THE POETS OF SUCCEEDING AGES HAVE DWELT MUCH IN DETAIL ON THE OCCURRENCES OF THIS MEMORABLE DAY
lbi-2035-152373-0004 LIKE THE TWO KINGS OF SPARTA THEY REIGNED JOINTLY DIVIDING BETWEEN THEM THE LABOURS AND CARES OF STATE
lbi-2035-152373-0005 IT WAS THE SEASON WHEN THE ANCIENT SUN GOD HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO RECEIVE HIS ANNUAL OBLATIONS AND WE CAN WELL BELIEVE THAT THOSE WHOSE HEARTS STILL TREMBLED AT THE NAME OF BEL MUST HAVE CONNECTED THE ECLIPSE AND THE PLAGUE WITH THE REVOLUTION IN THE NATIONAL WORSHIP AND THE OVERTHROW OF THE ANCIENT GODS ON THAT PLAIN OF PROSTRATION WHERE THEY HAD SO LONG RECEIVED THE HOMAGE OF AN ENTIRE PEOPLE
lbi-2035-152373-0006 LASTLY THE ROYAL BROTHERS FELL THEMSELVES VICTIMS TO THE EPIDEMIC WHICH SO SADLY SIGNALIZES THEIR REIGN
lbi-2035-152373-0007 THE ONLY CONFLICTS THAT OCCURRED ON IRISH SOIL WITH A PICTISH OR AN ANGLO SAXON FORCE IF WE EXCEPT THOSE WHO FORMED A CONTINGENT OF CONGAL'S ARMY AT MOIRA OCCURRED IN THE TIME OF THE HOSPITABLE FINNACTA
lbi-2035-152373-0008 AS LEADING TO THE MENTION OF OTHER INTERESTING EVENTS WE MUST SET THIS INROAD CLEARLY BEFORE THE READER
lbi-2035-152373-0009 THE SAXONS OF KENT AND THE SOUTHERN KINGDOMS GENERALLY WERE CONVERTED BY MISSIONARIES FROM FRANCE OR ROME OR NATIVE PREACHERS OF THE FIRST OR SECOND CHRISTIAN GENERATION THOSE OF NORTHUMBRIA RECOGNISE AS THEIR APOSTLES SAINT AIDAN AND SAINT CUTHBERT TWO FATHERS FROM IONA
lbi-2035-152373-0010 THE KINGDOM OF NORTHUMBRIA AS THE NAME IMPLIES EMBRACED NEARLY ALL THE COUNTRY FROM THE HUMBER TO THE PICTISH BORDER
lbi-2035-152373-0011 THE BARREN ROCK ABOUT THREE MILES IN LENGTH WAS COVERED WITH MONASTIC BUILDINGS AND ITS CEMETERY WAS ALREADY ADORNED WITH THE TOMBS OF SAINTS AND KINGS
lbi-2035-152373-0012 NOW EVERY MISSIONARY THAT EVER WENT OUT FROM IONA HAD TAUGHT THAT TO REDUCE CHRISTIANS TO SLAVERY WAS WHOLLY INCONSISTENT WITH A BELIEF IN THE DOCTRINES OF THE GOSPEL
lbi-2035-152373-0013 WHILE THE LIBERATED EXILES REJOICED ON THE PLAIN OF MEATH THE TENT OF THE ABBOT OF IONA WAS PITCHED ON THE RATH OF TARA A FACT WHICH WOULD SEEM TO INDICATE THAT ALREADY IN LITTLE MORE THAN A CENTURY SINCE THE INTERDICT HAD FALLEN ON IT THE EDIFICES WHICH MADE SO FINE A SHOW IN THE DAYS OF PATRICK WERE RUINED AND UNINHABITABLE
lbi-2035-152373-0014 SO SLOW AND PATIENT IS THE PROCESS BY WHICH CHRISTIANITY INFUSES ITSELF INTO THE SOCIAL LIFE OF A CONVERTED PEOPLE
lbi-2035-152373-0015 HERE THE HOLY PRELATE OF FERNS MET HIM AND RELATED A VISION IN WHICH HE HAD BEEN INSTRUCTED TO DEMAND THE ABOLITION OF THE IMPOST
lbi-2035-152373-0016 THE TRIBUTE WAS AT THIS PERIOD ENORMOUS FIFTEEN THOUSAND HEAD OF CATTLE ANNUALLY
lbi-2035-152373-0017 SAINT MOLING SURVIVED HIM THREE YEARS AND SAINT ADAMNAN SO INTIMATELY CONNECTED WITH HIS REIGN TEN YEARS
lbi-2035-152373-0018 NOTHING COULD BE MORE NATURAL THAN SUCH AN ASSEMBLY IN SUCH A PLACE AT SUCH A PERIOD
lbi-2078-142845-0000 KIRKLEATHAM YEAST
lbi-2078-142845-0001 SEVENTEEN SEVENTEEN
lbi-2078-142845-0002 TO MAKE GOOD HOME MADE BREAD
lbi-2078-142845-0003 SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN
lbi-2078-142845-0004 MODE PUT THE FLOUR INTO A LARGE EARTHENWARE BOWL OR DEEP PAN THEN WITH A STRONG METAL OR WOODEN SPOON HOLLOW OUT THE MIDDLE BUT DO NOT CLEAR IT ENTIRELY AWAY FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE PAN AS IN THAT CASE THE SPONGE OR LEAVEN AS IT WAS FORMERLY TERMED WOULD STICK TO IT WHICH IT OUGHT NOT TO DO
lbi-2078-142845-0005 NEXT TAKE EITHER A LARGE TABLESPOONFUL OF BREWER'S YEAST WHICH HAS BEEN RENDERED SOLID BY MIXING IT WITH PLENTY OF COLD WATER AND LETTING IT AFTERWARDS STAND TO SETTLE FOR A DAY AND NIGHT OR NEARLY AN OUNCE OF GERMAN YEAST PUT IT INTO A LARGE BASIN AND PROCEED TO MIX IT SO THAT IT SHALL BE AS SMOOTH AS CREAM WITH THREE QUARTERS PINT OF WARM MILK AND WATER OR WITH WATER ONLY THOUGH EVEN A VERY LITTLE MILK WILL MUCH IMPROVE THE BREAD
lbi-2078-142845-0006 LOOK AT IT FROM TIME TO TIME WHEN IT HAS BEEN LAID FOR NEARLY AN HOUR AND WHEN THE YEAST HAS RISEN AND BROKEN THROUGH THE FLOUR SO THAT BUBBLES APPEAR IN IT YOU WILL KNOW THAT IT IS READY TO BE MADE UP INTO DOUGH
lbi-2078-142845-0007 THEN PLACE THE PAN ON A STRONG CHAIR OR DRESSER OR TABLE OF CONVENIENT HEIGHT POUR INTO THE SPONGE THE REMAINDER OF THE WARM MILK AND WATER STIR INTO IT AS MUCH OF THE FLOUR AS YOU CAN WITH THE SPOON THEN WIPE IT OUT CLEAN WITH YOUR FINGERS AND LAY IT ASIDE
lbi-2078-142845-0008 TURN IT THEN ON TO A PASTE BOARD OR VERY CLEAN DRESSER AND WITH A LARGE SHARP KNIFE DIVIDE IT IN TWO MAKE IT UP QUICKLY INTO LOAVES AND DISPATCH IT TO THE OVEN MAKE ONE OR TWO INCISIONS ACROSS THE TOPS OF THE LOAVES AS THEY WILL RISE MORE EASILY IF THIS BE DONE
lbi-2078-142845-0009 ILLUSTRATION ITALIAN MILLET
lbi-2078-142845-0010 ITALIAN MILLET OR GREAT INDIAN MILLET IS CULTIVATED IN EGYPT AND NUBIA WHERE IT IS CALLED DHOURRA AND IS USED AS HUMAN FOOD AS WELL AS FOR THE FERMENTATION OF BEER
lbi-2078-142845-0011 IT WILL GROW ON POOR SOILS AND IS EXTREMELY PRODUCTIVE
lbi-2078-142845-0012 IT HAS BEEN INTRODUCED INTO ITALY WHERE THEY MAKE A COARSE BREAD FROM IT AND IT IS ALSO EMPLOYED IN PASTRY AND PUDDINGS THEY ALSO USE IT FOR FEEDING HORSES AND DOMESTIC FOWLS
lbi-2078-142845-0013 A YELLOW VARIETY CALLED GOLDEN MILLET IS SOLD IN THE GROCERS SHOPS FOR MAKING PUDDINGS AND IS VERY DELICATE AND WHOLESOME
lbi-2078-142845-0014 ANOTHER ADVANTAGE THE RED WHEATS POSSESS IS THEIR COMPARATIVE IMMUNITY FROM THE ATTACKS OF MILDEW AND FLY
lbi-2078-142845-0015 MODE BOIL THE RICE IN WATER UNTIL IT IS QUITE TENDER POUR OFF THE WATER AND PUT THE RICE BEFORE IT IS COLD TO THE FLOUR
lbi-2078-142845-0016 ILLUSTRATION MAIZE PLANT
lbi-2078-142845-0017 MAIZE NEXT TO WHEAT AND RICE MAIZE IS THE GRAIN MOST USED IN THE NOURISHMENT OF MAN
lbi-2078-142845-0018 IF CARRIED ANY DISTANCE IT SHOULD BE STORED AWAY IN AIR TIGHT VESSELS
lbi-2078-142845-0019 SOME OF THE PREPARATIONS OF MAIZE FLOUR ARE VERY GOOD AND WHEN PARTAKEN IN MODERATION SUITABLE FOOD FOR ALMOST EVERYBODY
lbi-2078-142845-0020 MODE LET THE TARTARIC ACID AND SALT BE REDUCED TO THE FINEST POSSIBLE POWDER THEN MIX THEM WELL WITH THE FLOUR
lbi-2078-142845-0021 SOUR MILK OR BUTTERMILK MAY BE USED BUT THEN A LITTLE LESS ACID WILL BE NEEDED
lbi-2078-142845-0022 EXCELLENT ROLLS
lbi-2078-142845-0023 HOT ROLLS
lbi-2078-142845-0024 SEVENTEEN TWENTY FOUR
lbi-2078-142845-0025 WHEN THEY ARE QUITE HOT DIVIDE THEM LENGTHWISE INTO THREE PUT SOME THIN FLAKES OF GOOD BUTTER BETWEEN THE SLICES PRESS THE ROLLS TOGETHER AND PUT THEM IN THE OVEN FOR A MINUTE OR TWO BUT NOT LONGER OR THE BUTTER WOULD OIL TAKE THEM OUT OF THE OVEN SPREAD THE BUTTER EQUALLY OVER DIVIDE THE ROLLS IN HALF AND PUT THEM ON TO A VERY HOT CLEAN DISH AND SEND THEM INSTANTLY TO TABLE
lbi-2078-142845-0026 TO MAKE DRY TOAST
lbi-2078-142845-0027 NEVER USE NEW BREAD FOR MAKING ANY KIND OF TOAST AS IT EATS HEAVY AND BESIDES IS VERY EXTRAVAGANT
lbi-2078-142845-0028 MOVE IT BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS UNTIL THE BREAD IS NICELY COLOURED THEN TURN IT AND TOAST THE OTHER SIDE AND DO NOT PLACE IT SO NEAR THE FIRE THAT IT BLACKENS
lbi-2078-142845-0029 TO MAKE HOT BUTTERED TOAST SEVENTEEN TWENTY SIX
lbi-2078-142845-0030 A LOAF OF HOUSEHOLD BREAD ABOUT TWO DAYS OLD ANSWERS FOR MAKING TOAST BETTER THAN COTTAGE BREAD THE LATTER NOT BEING A GOOD SHAPE AND TOO CRUSTY FOR THE PURPOSE
lbi-2078-142845-0031 CUT AS MANY NICE EVEN SLICES AS MAY BE REQUIRED RATHER MORE THAN ONE QUARTER INCH IN THICKNESS AND TOAST THEM BEFORE A VERY BRIGHT FIRE WITHOUT ALLOWING THE BREAD TO BLACKEN WHICH SPOILS THE APPEARANCE AND FLAVOUR OF ALL TOAST
lbi-2078-142845-0032 SOYER RECOMMENDS THAT EACH SLICE SHOULD BE CUT INTO PIECES AS SOON AS IT IS BUTTERED AND WHEN ALL ARE READY THAT THEY SHOULD BE PILED LIGHTLY ON THE DISH THEY ARE INTENDED TO BE SERVED ON
lbi-2078-142845-0033 HE SAYS THAT BY CUTTING THROUGH FOUR OR FIVE SLICES AT A TIME ALL THE BUTTER IS SQUEEZED OUT OF THE UPPER ONES WHILE THE BOTTOM ONE IS SWIMMING IN FAT LIQUID
lbi-2078-142845-0034 MUFFINS AND CRUMPETS SHOULD ALWAYS BE SERVED ON SEPARATE DISHES AND BOTH TOASTED AND SERVED AS EXPEDITIOUSLY AS POSSIBLE
lbi-2078-142845-0035 SUFFICIENT ALLOW TWO CRUMPETS TO EACH PERSON
lbi-2078-142845-0036 PLAIN BUNS SEVENTEEN TWENTY NINE
lbi-2078-142845-0037 MODE PUT THE FLOUR INTO A BASIN MIX THE SUGAR WELL WITH IT MAKE A HOLE IN THE CENTRE AND STIR IN THE YEAST AND MILK WHICH SHOULD BE LUKEWARM WITH ENOUGH OF THE FLOUR TO MAKE IT THE THICKNESS OF CREAM
lbi-2078-142845-0038 FROM FIFTEEN TO TWENTY MINUTES WILL BE REQUIRED TO BAKE THEM NICELY
lbi-2078-142845-0039 THESE BUNS MAY BE VARIED BY ADDING A FEW CURRANTS CANDIED PEEL OR CARAWAY SEEDS TO THE OTHER INGREDIENTS AND THE ABOVE MIXTURE ANSWERS FOR HOT CROSS BUNS BY PUTTING IN A LITTLE GROUND ALLSPICE AND BY PRESSING A TIN MOULD IN THE FORM OF A CROSS IN THE CENTRE OF THE BUN
lbi-2078-142845-0040 SUFFICIENT TO MAKE TWELVE BUNS SEASONABLE AT ANY TIME LIGHT BUNS
lbi-2078-142845-0041 ILLUSTRATION BUNS
lbi-2078-142845-0042 VICTORIA BUNS SEVENTEEN THIRTY TWO
lbi-2078-142845-0043 MODE WHISK THE EGG STIR IN THE SUGAR AND BEAT THESE INGREDIENTS WELL TOGETHER BEAT THE BUTTER TO A CREAM STIR IN THE GROUND RICE CURRANTS AND CANDIED PEEL AND AS MUCH FLOUR AS WILL MAKE IT OF SUCH A CONSISTENCY THAT IT MAY BE ROLLED INTO SEVEN OR EIGHT BALLS
lbi-2078-142845-0044 ITALIAN RUSKS
lbi-2078-142845-0045 THEY SHOULD BE KEPT IN A CLOSED TIN CANISTER IN A DRY PLACE TO PRESERVE THEIR CRISPNESS
lbi-2078-142845-0046 IT IS NOT CULTIVATED IN ENGLAND BEING PRINCIPALLY CONFINED TO THE EAST
lbi-2078-142845-0047 WHEN WE TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT THE ARABIANS ARE FOND OF LIZARDS AND LOCUSTS AS ARTICLES OF FOOD THEIR CUISINE ALTOGETHER IS SCARCELY A TEMPTING ONE
lbi-2078-142845-0048 SEVENTEEN THIRTY FOUR
lbi-2078-142845-0049 ILLUSTRATION RUSKS
lbi-2078-142845-0050 MODE PUT THE MILK AND BUTTER INTO A SAUCEPAN AND KEEP SHAKING IT ROUND UNTIL THE LATTER IS MELTED
lbi-2078-142845-0051 WHEN COLD THEY SHOULD BE PUT INTO TIN CANISTERS TO KEEP THEM DRY AND IF INTENDED FOR THE CHEESE COURSE THE SIFTED SUGAR SHOULD BE OMITTED
lbi-2086-149214-0000 THE NARRATIVE IT MAY BE IS WOVEN OF SO HUMBLE A TEXTURE AS TO REQUIRE THIS ADVANTAGE AND AT THE SAME TIME TO RENDER IT THE MORE DIFFICULT OF ATTAINMENT
lbi-2086-149214-0001 IN GOOD FAITH HOWEVER HE IS NOT SUFFICIENTLY IMAGINATIVE TO FLATTER HIMSELF WITH THE SLIGHTEST HOPE OF THIS KIND
lbi-2086-149214-0002 THE AUTHOR HAS CONSIDERED IT HARDLY WORTH HIS WHILE THEREFORE RELENTLESSLY TO IMPALE THE STORY WITH ITS MORAL AS WITH AN IRON ROD OR RATHER AS BY STICKING A PIN THROUGH A BUTTERFLY THUS AT ONCE DEPRIVING IT OF LIFE AND CAUSING IT TO STIFFEN IN AN UNGAINLY AND UNNATURAL ATTITUDE
lbi-2086-149214-0003 IF PERMITTED BY THE HISTORICAL CONNECTION WHICH THOUGH SLIGHT WAS ESSENTIAL TO HIS PLAN THE AUTHOR WOULD VERY WILLINGLY HAVE AVOIDED ANYTHING OF THIS NATURE
lbi-2086-149214-0004 HE TRUSTS NOT TO BE CONSIDERED AS UNPARDONABLY OFFENDING BY LAYING OUT A STREET THAT INFRINGES UPON NOBODY'S PRIVATE RIGHTS AND APPROPRIATING A LOT OF LAND WHICH HAD NO VISIBLE OWNER AND BUILDING A HOUSE OF MATERIALS LONG IN USE FOR CONSTRUCTING CASTLES IN THE AIR
lbi-2086-149220-0000 THE ENCLOSURE HAD FORMERLY BEEN VERY EXTENSIVE BUT WAS NOW CONTRACTED WITHIN SMALL COMPASS AND HEMMED ABOUT PARTLY BY HIGH WOODEN FENCES AND PARTLY BY THE OUTBUILDINGS OF HOUSES THAT STOOD ON ANOTHER STREET
lbi-2086-149220-0001 THE WHITE DOUBLE ROSEBUSH HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN PROPPED UP ANEW AGAINST THE HOUSE SINCE THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE SEASON AND A PEAR TREE AND THREE DAMSON TREES WHICH EXCEPT A ROW OF CURRANT BUSHES CONSTITUTED THE ONLY VARIETIES OF FRUIT BORE MARKS OF THE RECENT AMPUTATION OF SEVERAL SUPERFLUOUS OR DEFECTIVE LIMBS
lbi-2086-149220-0002 THERE WERE ALSO A FEW SPECIES OF ANTIQUE AND HEREDITARY FLOWERS IN NO VERY FLOURISHING CONDITION BUT SCRUPULOUSLY WEEDED AS IF SOME PERSON EITHER OUT OF LOVE OR CURIOSITY HAD BEEN ANXIOUS TO BRING THEM TO SUCH PERFECTION AS THEY WERE CAPABLE OF ATTAINING
lbi-2086-149220-0003 SUMMER SQUASHES ALMOST IN THEIR GOLDEN BLOSSOM CUCUMBERS NOW EVINCING A TENDENCY TO SPREAD AWAY FROM THE MAIN STOCK AND RAMBLE FAR AND WIDE TWO OR THREE ROWS OF STRING BEANS AND AS MANY MORE THAT WERE ABOUT TO FESTOON THEMSELVES ON POLES TOMATOES OCCUPYING A SITE SO SHELTERED AND SUNNY THAT THE PLANTS WERE ALREADY GIGANTIC AND PROMISED AN EARLY AND ABUNDANT HARVEST
lbi-2086-149220-0004 PHOEBE WONDERED WHOSE CARE AND TOIL IT COULD HAVE BEEN THAT HAD PLANTED THESE VEGETABLES AND KEPT THE SOIL SO CLEAN AND ORDERLY
lbi-2086-149220-0005 BEES TOO STRANGE TO SAY HAD THOUGHT IT WORTH THEIR WHILE TO COME HITHER POSSIBLY FROM THE RANGE OF HIVES BESIDE SOME FARM HOUSE MILES AWAY
lbi-2086-149220-0006 THIS WAS A FOUNTAIN SET ROUND WITH A RIM OF OLD MOSSY STONES AND PAVED IN ITS BED WITH WHAT APPEARED TO BE A SORT OF MOSAIC WORK OF VARIOUSLY COLORED PEBBLES
lbi-2086-149220-0007 IT NOW CONTAINED ONLY CHANTICLEER HIS TWO WIVES AND A SOLITARY CHICKEN
lbi-2086-149220-0008 IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE RACE HAD DEGENERATED LIKE MANY A NOBLE RACE BESIDES IN CONSEQUENCE OF TOO STRICT A WATCHFULNESS TO KEEP IT PURE
lbi-2086-149220-0009 THESE FEATHERED PEOPLE HAD EXISTED TOO LONG IN THEIR DISTINCT VARIETY A FACT OF WHICH THE PRESENT REPRESENTATIVES JUDGING BY THEIR LUGUBRIOUS DEPORTMENT SEEMED TO BE AWARE
lbi-2086-149220-0010 THEY KEPT THEMSELVES ALIVE UNQUESTIONABLY AND LAID NOW AND THEN AN EGG AND HATCHED A CHICKEN NOT FOR ANY PLEASURE OF THEIR OWN BUT THAT THE WORLD MIGHT NOT ABSOLUTELY LOSE WHAT HAD ONCE BEEN SO ADMIRABLE A BREED OF FOWLS
lbi-2086-149220-0011 THE DISTINGUISHING MARK OF THE HENS WAS A CREST OF LAMENTABLY SCANTY GROWTH IN THESE LATTER DAYS BUT SO ODDLY AND WICKEDLY ANALOGOUS TO HEPZIBAH'S TURBAN THAT PHOEBE TO THE POIGNANT DISTRESS OF HER CONSCIENCE BUT INEVITABLY WAS LED TO FANCY A GENERAL RESEMBLANCE BETWIXT THESE FORLORN BIPEDS AND HER RESPECTABLE RELATIVE
lbi-2086-149220-0012 THE CHICKEN CREPT THROUGH THE PALES OF THE COOP AND RAN WITH SOME SHOW OF LIVELINESS TO HER FEET WHILE CHANTICLEER AND THE LADIES OF HIS HOUSEHOLD REGARDED HER WITH QUEER SIDELONG GLANCES AND THEN CROAKED ONE TO ANOTHER AS IF COMMUNICATING THEIR SAGE OPINIONS OF HER CHARACTER
lbi-2086-149220-0013 SO WISE AS WELL AS ANTIQUE WAS THEIR ASPECT AS TO GIVE COLOR TO THE IDEA NOT MERELY THAT THEY WERE THE DESCENDANTS OF A TIME HONORED RACE BUT THAT THEY HAD EXISTED IN THEIR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY EVER SINCE THE HOUSE OF THE SEVEN GABLES WAS FOUNDED AND WERE SOMEHOW MIXED UP WITH ITS DESTINY
lbi-2086-149220-0014 HE HELD A HOE IN HIS HAND AND WHILE PHOEBE WAS GONE IN QUEST OF THE CRUMBS HAD BEGUN TO BUSY HIMSELF WITH DRAWING UP FRESH EARTH ABOUT THE ROOTS OF THE TOMATOES
lbi-2086-149220-0015 THEY HAVE KNOWN ME MUCH LONGER BUT NEVER HONOR ME WITH ANY FAMILIARITY THOUGH HARDLY A DAY PASSES WITHOUT MY BRINGING THEM FOOD
lbi-2086-149220-0016 MISS HEPZIBAH I SUPPOSE WILL INTERWEAVE THE FACT WITH HER OTHER TRADITIONS AND SET IT DOWN THAT THE FOWLS KNOW YOU TO BE A PYNCHEON
lbi-2086-149220-0017 AH BUT THESE HENS ANSWERED THE YOUNG MAN THESE HENS OF ARISTOCRATIC LINEAGE WOULD SCORN TO UNDERSTAND THE VULGAR LANGUAGE OF A BARN YARD FOWL
lbi-2086-149220-0018 I PREFER TO THINK AND SO WOULD MISS HEPZIBAH THAT THEY RECOGNIZE THE FAMILY TONE FOR YOU ARE A PYNCHEON
lbi-2086-149220-0019 MY NAME IS PHOEBE PYNCHEON SAID THE GIRL WITH A MANNER OF SOME RESERVE FOR SHE WAS AWARE THAT HER NEW ACQUAINTANCE COULD BE NO OTHER THAN THE DAGUERREOTYPIST OF WHOSE LAWLESS PROPENSITIES THE OLD MAID HAD GIVEN HER A DISAGREEABLE IDEA
lbi-2086-149220-0020 I TURN UP THE EARTH BY WAY OF PASTIME
lbi-2086-149220-0021 IT IS LIKE A BANDAGE OVER ONE'S EYES TO COME INTO IT
lbi-2086-149220-0022 IF YOU WOULD PERMIT ME SAID THE ARTIST LOOKING AT PHOEBE I SHOULD LIKE TO TRY WHETHER THE DAGUERREOTYPE CAN BRING OUT DISAGREEABLE TRAITS ON A PERFECTLY AMIABLE FACE
lbi-2086-149220-0023 MOST OF MY LIKENESSES DO LOOK UNAMIABLE BUT THE VERY SUFFICIENT REASON I FANCY IS BECAUSE THE ORIGINALS ARE SO
lbi-2086-149220-0024 THERE IS A WONDERFUL INSIGHT IN HEAVEN'S BROAD AND SIMPLE SUNSHINE
lbi-2086-149220-0025 WHILE WE GIVE IT CREDIT ONLY FOR DEPICTING THE MEREST SURFACE IT ACTUALLY BRINGS OUT THE SECRET CHARACTER WITH A TRUTH THAT NO PAINTER WOULD EVER VENTURE UPON EVEN COULD HE DETECT IT
lbi-2086-149220-0026 YET THE ORIGINAL WEARS TO COMMON EYES A VERY DIFFERENT EXPRESSION
lbi-2086-149220-0027 HE EXHIBITED A DAGUERREOTYPE MINIATURE IN A MOROCCO CASE
lbi-2086-149220-0028 PHOEBE MERELY GLANCED AT IT AND GAVE IT BACK
lbi-2086-149220-0029 I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT THIS IS A MODERN FACE AND ONE WHICH YOU WILL VERY PROBABLY MEET
lbi-2086-149220-0030 THE SUN AS YOU SEE TELLS QUITE ANOTHER STORY AND WILL NOT BE COAXED OUT OF IT AFTER HALF A DOZEN PATIENT ATTEMPTS ON MY PART
lbi-2086-149220-0031 HERE WE HAVE THE MAN SLY SUBTLE HARD IMPERIOUS AND WITHAL COLD AS ICE LOOK AT THAT EYE
lbi-2086-149220-0032 AND YET IF YOU COULD ONLY SEE THE BENIGN SMILE OF THE ORIGINAL
lbi-2086-149220-0033 WELL I DON'T WISH TO SEE IT ANY MORE OBSERVED PHOEBE TURNING AWAY HER EYES IT IS CERTAINLY VERY LIKE THE OLD PORTRAIT
lbi-2086-149220-0034 IF THE ORIGINAL IS STILL IN THE WORLD I THINK HE MIGHT DEFY THE SUN TO MAKE HIM LOOK STERN AND HARD
lbi-2086-149220-0035 IS THERE NOTHING WILD IN THE EYE CONTINUED HOLGRAVE SO EARNESTLY THAT IT EMBARRASSED PHOEBE AS DID ALSO THE QUIET FREEDOM WITH WHICH HE PRESUMED ON THEIR SO RECENT ACQUAINTANCE
lbi-2086-149220-0036 IT IS NONSENSE SAID PHOEBE A LITTLE IMPATIENTLY FOR US TO TALK ABOUT A PICTURE WHICH YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN
lbi-2086-149220-0037 SINCE YOU ARE A FRIEND OF MY COUSIN HEPZIBAH'S YOU SHOULD ASK HER TO SHOW YOU THE PICTURE
lbi-2086-149220-0038 SO WE WILL BE FELLOW LABORERS SOMEWHAT ON THE COMMUNITY SYSTEM
lbi-2086-149220-0039 SHE DID NOT ALTOGETHER LIKE HIM
lbi-2086-149220-0040 OH REJOINED THE DAGUERREOTYPIST BECAUSE LIKE AN OLD LADY'S CUP OF TEA IT IS WATER BEWITCHED
lbi-2086-149220-0041 SHE WAS INDISTINCTLY AWARE HOWEVER THAT THE GAUNT FIGURE OF THE OLD GENTLEWOMAN WAS SITTING IN ONE OF THE STRAIGHT BACKED CHAIRS A LITTLE WITHDRAWN FROM THE WINDOW THE FAINT GLEAM OF WHICH SHOWED THE BLANCHED PALENESS OF HER CHEEK TURNED SIDEWAYS TOWARDS A CORNER
lbi-2086-149220-0042 BUT PUT IT ON THE TABLE IN THE CORNER OF THE PASSAGE
lbi-2086-149220-0043 WHAT AN INSTRUMENT IS THE HUMAN VOICE
lbi-2086-149220-0044 HOW WONDERFULLY RESPONSIVE TO EVERY EMOTION OF THE HUMAN SOUL
lbi-2086-149220-0045 FEWER WORDS THAN BEFORE BUT WITH THE SAME MYSTERIOUS MUSIC IN THEM
lbi-2086-149220-0046 PRAY GO TO BED FOR I AM SURE YOU MUST NEED REST
lbi-2086-149220-0047 I WILL SIT IN THE PARLOR AWHILE AND COLLECT MY THOUGHTS
lbi-2086-149220-0048 WHILE THUS DISMISSING HER THE MAIDEN LADY STEPT FORWARD KISSED PHOEBE AND PRESSED HER TO HER HEART WHICH BEAT AGAINST THE GIRL'S BOSOM WITH A STRONG HIGH AND TUMULTUOUS SWELL
lbi-2086-149220-0049 AT SOME UNCERTAIN PERIOD IN THE DEPTHS OF NIGHT AND AS IT WERE THROUGH THE THIN VEIL OF A DREAM SHE WAS CONSCIOUS OF A FOOTSTEP MOUNTING THE STAIRS HEAVILY BUT NOT WITH FORCE AND DECISION
