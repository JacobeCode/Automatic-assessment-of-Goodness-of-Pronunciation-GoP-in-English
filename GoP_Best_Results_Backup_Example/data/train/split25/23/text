096130001	I WANTED TO SEE THE WORLD
096130002	THAT WAS ALL HE COULD THINK
096130003	HE LOOKED AT HER FOR A LONG TIME
096130004	AND WHAT OF THAT MAN
096130005	SHE HAD LOVED BEFORE BUT NOT LIKE THIS
096130006	BUT SHE WOULD BE BACK
096130007	THERE IS NO PLACE FOR ME IN HIS HEART
096130008	I KEEP MY EYES ON HIM
096130009	IT SOUNDED AS IF HE WERE GOING TO SAY MORE
096130010	THE BEST ONE I HAVE
096130011	I JUST NEED TO GO THERE
096130012	THEN SHE SAW THE WAY OUT
096130013	HE THOUGHT ABOUT SOMETHING AND THEN HE ASKED
096130014	HE WAS HE ADMITTED NEVER VERY GOOD WITH HIS HANDS
096130016	I HAVE A GUN TO YOUR HEAD RIGHT NOW
096130017	AND HERE YOU ARE AND YOU ARE SO PRETTY
096130018	I WALKED INTO THE ROOM MY HAND ON HER SHOULDER
096130019	HE TURNED AROUND TO FACE HER
096130020	THE FIRST THING IS TO GET HIM AWAY
096130021	I LOOK UP AT THE HOUSE
096140002	I NEVER THOUGHT YOU WOULD BE ONE FOR THE SUBURBS
096140003	AND THERE WAS A STRANGE LOOK IN HER EYES
096140004	THE STUDENT THEN TURNED HIS HEAD AND LOOKED AT ME
096140005	BUT THAT IS WHY WE ARE HERE
096140006	SHE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS
096140007	IT WAS SOME TIME BEFORE HE COULD SEE ANYTHING
096140008	THERE WAS NO WAY THEY SAW HIM
096140009	NO I DO NOT OWN THEM
096140010	THEY WERE UP TO SOMETHING
096140011	YOU COULD ALWAYS TELL WHAT WAS ON MY MIND
096140012	I ASKED AS SHE CLOSED THE DOOR
096140014	HE WILL COME BACK IN A LITTLE WHILE
096140015	HE WALKED AROUND TO THE OTHER SIDE OF HER BED
096140016	THAT WAS THE FIRST THING ABOUT HER THAT ATTRACTED ME
096140017	I MUST HAVE AN END PUT TO ALL THIS
096140018	IF NOT HOW SHOULD THEY KNOW HE WAS DEAD
096140019	WHAT ELSE WOULD I WANT TO HAVE
096140020	HE LOOKED OVER HIS HAND AND SMILED
096140021	I AM THE ONE WHO MADE YOU
096140022	I WOULD LOVE FOR US TO STAY THERE ONCE AGAIN
096150003	I ASKED WITH A SMILE ON MY FACE
096150005	BUT SHE HAD LEFT THAT LIFE BEHIND NOW TOO
096150006	THERE WAS NO WAY SOMETHING LIKE THIS COULD BE REALITY
096150007	SHE HAD MADE UP HER MIND IN ALL GOOD FAITH
096150009	THEY WERE GOING TO SEND HER BACK IN TIME
096150010	THE WOMAN TURNED HER HEAD TO LOOK OUT THE WINDOW
096150011	THIS GIRL SHE WAS EVERYTHING I NEVER WAS
096150012	THERE WAS ONCE AGAIN SILENCE SO I LET IT BE
096150013	I HAVE TO GO SAY HI TO SOME MORE PEOPLE
096150016	HE THEN LOOKED DOWN AT HIS HANDS
096150017	I HAD VERY LITTLE OF MY OWN
096150018	HE ONE THE OTHER HAND WAS DIFFERENT
096150019	I HAVE NO PLACE IN YOUR HEART
096150020	IT WAS AN AFFAIR THAT BUT OF A MOMENT
096150021	I LOOKED INTO HER EYES AND FOUND THE TRUTH
096150024	IT WAS THE LITERATURE OF LOVE NOT OF THE LOVE
096150025	I WAS VERY NERVOUS FOR A LONG TIME AFTER THIS
096150026	I ACTUALLY OPENED MY EYES AND SAW WHERE I WAS
096150027	HE WAS EVER THE SAME TO ME
096150028	SHE MUST BE COMING FOR ME AGAIN
096160001	HE LOOKED UP AND SAW A MAN
096160002	ALL OF YOU WILL BE THERE
096160003	SHE COULD JUST SEE IT
096160004	BUT NO WAY TO FIND WHAT THEY NEED
096160005	THE FIRST ONE WAS HIS EYES
096160006	THERE WERE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE CARRIAGE WITH THEM
096160007	YOU CAN GO BACK TO THE STORY NOW
096160008	I DROPPED MY HAND AND PUT IT ON MY SIDE
096160009	AND TO THINK I COULD GET AWAY FROM WORK
096160010	THEY OPENED THE DOOR AND WALKED IN
096160011	IT'S A GOOD THING NO ONE WAS AROUND THE PLACE
096160012	IF YOU ARE GOING TO COME IN THEN COME IN
096160013	I WANT TO FEEL YOU MORE AND MORE
096160014	NOW I COULD NEVER DO ANY OF THAT AGAIN
096160015	I WOULD LIKE TO LIVE A LONG LIFE
096160016	I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT THROUGH
096160017	IT SEEMED THAT WAS WHERE IT WAS COMING FROM
096160018	HE WOULD NOT LET THE CONVENTION END LIKE THIS
096160019	BUT EVEN THIS WAS AS NOTHING
096160020	HE STARTED TO ASK IF I WAS ALL RIGHT
096190001	HE WANTED TO DO THIS RIGHT
096190002	BUT THERE WAS NO ONE
096190003	AND YOU OF ALL PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW
096190004	HOW COULD HE JUST FIND ME LIKE THAT
096190005	THEN SHE OPENED HER EYES AND LOOKED AT HER WATCH
096190006	IT IS WHAT HE WOULD WANT
096190007	THE GIRL SEEMED TO SEE THEM FOR THE FIRST TIME
096190008	THERE WAS NOTHING HERE TO GO ON
096190009	YOU REALLY THINK YOU ARE GOING TO DEFEAT ME
096190010	BUT IT WILL GET BETTER
096190011	THAT WAS THE WAY OUT
096190012	HE HAD INDEED COME ON MORE THAN HE THOUGHT
096190013	BUT WE WERE STILL THE BEST OF FRIENDS
096190014	THIS IS THE ONLY PLACE WHERE YOU WILL BE SAFE
096190015	THERE WAS ANOTHER LITTLE THING HE HAD TO SAY
096190016	HE ASKED AS HE PUT HIS ARM AROUND HER
096190017	WHAT ELSE WAS THERE LEFT TO DO
096190019	AND YET HOW INDIFFERENT IT ALL WAS TO ME NOW
096190020	AND THE WORLD IS OVER
096190021	I NEED TO MAKE IT
