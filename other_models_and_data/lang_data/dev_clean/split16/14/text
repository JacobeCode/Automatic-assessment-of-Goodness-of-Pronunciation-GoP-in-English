lbi-777-126732-0002 AT BEST THEY CAN ONLY INTERPRET THE MIND OF THE PROPHET AND CAN HAVE NO OBJECTIVE VALUE
lbi-777-126732-0003 MICHAELIS THE TICKET OF LEAVE APOSTLE WAS SPEAKING IN AN EVEN VOICE A VOICE THAT WHEEZED AS IF DEADENED AND OPPRESSED BY THE LAYER OF FAT ON HIS CHEST
lbi-777-126732-0004 AND EVER SINCE HE HAD NEVER MANAGED TO GET HIS WEIGHT DOWN AS MUCH AS AN OUNCE
lbi-777-126732-0005 WITH HIS ELBOW PRESENTING NO APPEARANCE OF A JOINT BUT MORE LIKE A BEND IN A DUMMY'S LIMB THROWN OVER THE BACK OF A CHAIR HE LEANED FORWARD SLIGHTLY OVER HIS SHORT AND ENORMOUS THIGHS TO SPIT INTO THE GRATE
lbi-777-126732-0006 YES I HAD THE TIME TO THINK THINGS OUT A LITTLE HE ADDED WITHOUT EMPHASIS
lbi-777-126732-0007 WHEN HE ROSE PAINFULLY THE THRUSTING FORWARD OF A SKINNY GROPING HAND DEFORMED BY GOUTY SWELLINGS SUGGESTED THE EFFORT OF A MORIBUND MURDERER SUMMONING ALL HIS REMAINING STRENGTH FOR A LAST STAB
lbi-777-126732-0008 HIS ENUNCIATION WOULD HAVE BEEN ALMOST TOTALLY UNINTELLIGIBLE TO A STRANGER
lbi-777-126732-0009 THE OLD TERRORIST TURNED SLOWLY HIS HEAD ON HIS SKINNY NECK FROM SIDE TO SIDE
lbi-777-126732-0010 AND I COULD NEVER GET AS MANY AS THREE SUCH MEN TOGETHER
lbi-777-126732-0011 THE POSSESSORS OF PROPERTY HAD NOT ONLY TO FACE THE AWAKENED PROLETARIAT BUT THEY HAD ALSO TO FIGHT AMONGST THEMSELVES YES
lbi-777-126732-0012 STRUGGLE WARFARE WAS THE CONDITION OF PRIVATE OWNERSHIP IT WAS FATAL
lbi-777-126732-0013 AH HE DID NOT DEPEND UPON EMOTIONAL EXCITEMENT TO KEEP UP HIS BELIEF NO DECLAMATIONS NO ANGER NO VISIONS OF BLOOD RED FLAGS WAVING OR METAPHORICAL LURID SUNS OF VENGEANCE RISING ABOVE THE HORIZON OF A DOOMED SOCIETY NOT HE
lbi-777-126732-0014 DON'T YOU THINK THAT IF I HAD NOT BEEN THE OPTIMIST I AM I COULD NOT HAVE FOUND IN FIFTEEN YEARS SOME MEANS TO CUT MY THROAT
lbi-777-126732-0015 A HARSH LAUGH FROM COMRADE OSSIPON CUT THE TIRADE DEAD SHORT IN A SUDDEN FALTERING OF THE TONGUE AND A BEWILDERED UNSTEADINESS OF THE APOSTLE'S MILDLY EXALTED EYES
lbi-777-126732-0016 ALEXANDER OSSIPON GOT UP TALL IN HIS THREADBARE BLUE SERGE SUIT UNDER THE LOW CEILING SHOOK OFF THE STIFFNESS OF LONG IMMOBILITY AND STROLLED AWAY INTO THE KITCHEN DOWN TWO STEPS TO LOOK OVER STEVIE'S SHOULDER
lbi-777-126732-0017 VERY CHARACTERISTIC PERFECTLY TYPICAL
lbi-777-126732-0018 YOU WOULD CALL THAT LAD A DEGENERATE WOULD YOU MUMBLED MISTER VERLOC
lbi-777-126732-0019 IT WAS KARL YUNDT WHO WAS HEARD IMPLACABLE TO HIS LAST BREATH
lbi-777-126732-0020 LOMBROSO IS AN ASS
lbi-777-126732-0021 FOR HIM THE CRIMINAL IS THE PRISONER SIMPLE IS IT NOT
lbi-777-126732-0022 THERE WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY FORCE OF SUGGESTION IN THIS POSTURING
lbi-777-126732-0023 THE FAMOUS TERRORIST HAD NEVER IN HIS LIFE RAISED PERSONALLY AS MUCH AS HIS LITTLE FINGER AGAINST THE SOCIAL EDIFICE
lbi-777-126732-0024 THE SHADOW OF HIS EVIL GIFT CLUNG TO HIM YET LIKE THE SMELL OF A DEADLY DRUG IN AN OLD VIAL OF POISON EMPTIED NOW USELESS READY TO BE THROWN AWAY UPON THE RUBBISH HEAP OF THINGS THAT HAD SERVED THEIR TIME
lbi-777-126732-0025 MICHAELIS THE TICKET OF LEAVE APOSTLE SMILED VAGUELY WITH HIS GLUED LIPS HIS PASTY MOON FACE DROOPED UNDER THE WEIGHT OF MELANCHOLY ASSENT
lbi-777-126732-0026 HE HAD BEEN A PRISONER HIMSELF
lbi-777-126732-0027 HIS OWN SKIN HAD SIZZLED UNDER THE RED HOT BRAND HE MURMURED SOFTLY
lbi-777-126732-0028 YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND HE BEGAN DISDAINFULLY BUT STOPPED SHORT INTIMIDATED BY THE DEAD BLACKNESS OF THE CAVERNOUS EYES IN THE FACE TURNED SLOWLY TOWARDS HIM WITH A BLIND STARE AS IF GUIDED ONLY BY THE SOUND
lbi-777-126732-0029 HE GAVE THE DISCUSSION UP WITH A SLIGHT SHRUG OF THE SHOULDERS
lbi-777-126732-0030 STEVIE ACCUSTOMED TO MOVE ABOUT DISREGARDED HAD GOT UP FROM THE KITCHEN TABLE CARRYING OFF HIS DRAWING TO BED WITH HIM
lbi-777-126732-0031 THE SHEET OF PAPER COVERED WITH CIRCLES DROPPED OUT OF HIS FINGERS AND HE REMAINED STARING AT THE OLD TERRORIST AS IF ROOTED SUDDENLY TO THE SPOT BY HIS MORBID HORROR AND DREAD OF PHYSICAL PAIN
lbi-777-126732-0032 HIS SCARED EYES BLAZED WITH INDIGNATION IT WOULD HURT TERRIBLY HIS MOUTH DROPPED OPEN
lbi-777-126732-0033 COMRADE OSSIPON'S FACE TWITCHED WITH EXASPERATION
lbi-777-126732-0034 I DON'T SAY THAT PROTESTED MICHAELIS GENTLY
lbi-777-126732-0035 HIS VISION OF TRUTH HAD GROWN SO INTENSE THAT THE SOUND OF A STRANGE VOICE FAILED TO ROUT IT THIS TIME
lbi-777-126732-0036 THE COALS IN THE GRATE SETTLED DOWN WITH A SLIGHT CRASH AND MICHAELIS THE HERMIT OF VISIONS IN THE DESERT OF A PENITENTIARY GOT UP IMPETUOUSLY
lbi-777-126732-0037 THE DISDAINFUL POUT OF COMRADE OSSIPON'S THICK LIPS ACCENTUATED THE NEGRO TYPE OF HIS FACE
lbi-777-126732-0038 HE PAUSED THEN ADDED WITH MODEST FIRMNESS
lbi-777-126732-0039 I WOULD CALL IT CANNIBALISTIC THAT'S WHAT IT IS
lbi-777-126732-0040 THEY ARE NOURISHING THEIR GREED ON THE QUIVERING FLESH AND THE WARM BLOOD OF THE PEOPLE NOTHING ELSE
lbi-777-126732-0041 STEVIE SWALLOWED THE TERRIFYING STATEMENT WITH AN AUDIBLE GULP AND AT ONCE AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN SWIFT POISON SANK LIMPLY IN A SITTING POSTURE ON THE STEPS OF THE KITCHEN DOOR
lbi-777-126732-0042 HE CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND THEIR BACKS WITH RESTRAINED VIOLENCE TURNED THE KEY SHOT THE BOLT
lbi-777-126732-0043 HE WAS NOT SATISFIED WITH HIS FRIENDS
lbi-777-126732-0044 WITH THE INSIGHT OF A KINDRED TEMPERAMENT HE PRONOUNCED HIS VERDICT
lbi-777-126732-0045 THERE ARE NATURES TOO TO WHOSE SENSE OF JUSTICE THE PRICE EXACTED LOOMS UP MONSTROUSLY ENORMOUS ODIOUS OPPRESSIVE WORRYING HUMILIATING EXTORTIONATE INTOLERABLE THOSE ARE THE FANATICS
lbi-777-126732-0046 IN ANY CASE HE HAD NOT THE TIME
lbi-777-126732-0047 LOAFING WAS ALL VERY WELL FOR THESE FELLOWS WHO KNEW NOT MISTER VLADIMIR AND HAD WOMEN TO FALL BACK UPON WHEREAS HE HAD A WOMAN TO PROVIDE FOR
lbi-777-126732-0048 THESE WERE BUT FEW AND FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE HE OPENED HIS SHOP HE TOOK A COMMERCIAL SURVEY OF ITS VALUE
lbi-777-126732-0049 THIS SURVEY WAS UNFAVOURABLE
lbi-777-126732-0050 HE TOOK THE CASH BOX OUT OF THE DRAWER AND TURNING TO LEAVE THE SHOP BECAME AWARE THAT STEVIE WAS STILL DOWNSTAIRS
lbi-777-126732-0051 HE LOOKED DUBIOUSLY AT HIS BROTHER IN LAW BUT HE DID NOT ASK HIM FOR INFORMATION
lbi-777-126732-0052 MISTER VERLOC PERCEIVED WITH SOME SURPRISE THAT HE DID NOT KNOW REALLY WHAT TO SAY TO STEVIE
lbi-777-126732-0053 HE STOOD STILL IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PARLOUR AND LOOKED INTO THE KITCHEN IN SILENCE
lbi-777-126732-0054 HE WATCHED HIM GESTICULATING AND MURMURING IN THE KITCHEN
lbi-777-126732-0055 STEVIE PROWLED ROUND THE TABLE LIKE AN EXCITED ANIMAL IN A CAGE
lbi-777-126732-0056 THE LIGHT THROWN DOWN BY THE SHADE FELL DAZZLINGLY ON THE WHITE PILLOW SUNK BY THE WEIGHT OF HER HEAD REPOSING WITH CLOSED EYES AND DARK HAIR DONE UP IN SEVERAL PLAITS FOR THE NIGHT
lbi-777-126732-0057 HER BARE FEET AS IF POKED THROUGH THE BOTTOM OF AN UNADORNED SLEEVED CALICO SACK BUTTONED TIGHTLY AT NECK AND WRISTS FELT OVER THE RUG FOR THE SLIPPERS WHILE SHE LOOKED UPWARD INTO HER HUSBAND'S FACE
lbi-777-126732-0058 THERE IS NO OCCUPATION THAT FAILS A MAN MORE COMPLETELY THAN THAT OF A SECRET AGENT OF POLICE
lbi-777-126732-0059 IT'S LIKE YOUR HORSE SUDDENLY FALLING DEAD UNDER YOU IN THE MIDST OF AN UNINHABITED AND THIRSTY PLAIN
lbi-777-126732-0060 THE COMPARISON OCCURRED TO MISTER VERLOC BECAUSE HE HAD SAT ASTRIDE VARIOUS ARMY HORSES IN HIS TIME AND HAD NOW THE SENSATION OF AN INCIPIENT FALL
lbi-777-126732-0061 THE PROSPECT WAS AS BLACK AS THE WINDOW PANE AGAINST WHICH HE WAS LEANING HIS FOREHEAD
lbi-777-126732-0062 YES NOT AT ALL WELL
lbi-777-126732-0063 DOWN BELOW IN THE QUIET NARROW STREET MEASURED FOOTSTEPS APPROACHED THE HOUSE THEN DIED AWAY UNHURRIED AND FIRM AS IF THE PASSER BY HAD STARTED TO PACE OUT ALL ETERNITY FROM GAS LAMP TO GAS LAMP IN A NIGHT WITHOUT END AND THE DROWSY TICKING OF THE OLD CLOCK ON THE LANDING BECAME DISTINCTLY AUDIBLE IN THE BEDROOM
lbi-777-126732-0064 THAT POOR BOY IS IN A VERY EXCITED STATE TO NIGHT SHE MURMURED AFTER A PAUSE WHICH LASTED FOR THREE TICKS OF THE CLOCK
lbi-777-126732-0065 THIS DREAD LED HIM TO MAKE THE REMARK THAT STEVIE HAD DISREGARDED HIS SUGGESTION TO GO TO BED
lbi-777-126732-0066 THERE WAS NO YOUNG MAN OF HIS AGE IN LONDON MORE WILLING AND DOCILE THAN STEPHEN SHE AFFIRMED NONE MORE AFFECTIONATE AND READY TO PLEASE AND EVEN USEFUL AS LONG AS PEOPLE DID NOT UPSET HIS POOR HEAD
lbi-777-126732-0067 MISTER VERLOC'S ANXIETIES HAD PREVENTED HIM FROM ATTACHING ANY SENSE TO WHAT HIS WIFE WAS SAYING
lbi-777-126732-0068 THAT BOY HEARS TOO MUCH OF WHAT IS TALKED ABOUT HERE
lbi-777-126732-0069 IF I HAD KNOWN THEY WERE COMING TO NIGHT I WOULD HAVE SEEN TO IT THAT HE WENT TO BED AT THE SAME TIME I DID
lbi-777-126732-0070 HE WAS OUT OF HIS MIND WITH SOMETHING HE OVERHEARD ABOUT EATING PEOPLE'S FLESH AND DRINKING BLOOD WHAT'S THE GOOD OF TALKING LIKE THAT
lbi-777-126732-0071 MISTER VERLOC WAS FULLY RESPONSIVE NOW
lbi-777-126732-0072 ASK KARL YUNDT HE GROWLED SAVAGELY
lbi-777-126732-0073 HE ISN'T FIT TO HEAR WHAT'S SAID HERE HE BELIEVES IT'S ALL TRUE
lbi-777-126732-0074 HE KNOWS NO BETTER HE GETS INTO HIS PASSIONS OVER IT
lbi-777-126732-0075 HE GLARED AT ME AS IF HE DIDN'T KNOW WHO I WAS WHEN I WENT DOWNSTAIRS
lbi-777-126732-0076 I WISH HE HAD NEVER BEEN TO SCHOOL MISSUS VERLOC BEGAN AGAIN BRUSQUELY
lbi-777-126732-0077 HE GETS A RED FACE PORING OVER THEM
lbi-777-126732-0078 I WOULDN'T GIVE A HALFPENNY FOR THE WHOLE LOT
lbi-777-126732-0079 THE OTHER DAY STEVIE GOT HOLD OF ONE AND THERE WAS A STORY IN IT OF A GERMAN SOLDIER OFFICER TEARING HALF OFF THE EAR OF A RECRUIT AND NOTHING WAS DONE TO HIM FOR IT THE BRUTE
lbi-777-126732-0080 HE CAN'T STAND THE NOTION OF ANY CRUELTY
lbi-777-126732-0081 COMFORTABLE DEAR
lbi-7850-111771-0000 THROUGH THE INFLUENCE OF HON THOMAS L HAMER HE WAS ADMITTED AT WEST POINT IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY NINE
lbi-7850-111771-0001 AT THIS TIME GRANT WAS NOT TAKEN WITH WAR AND PROBABLY EVINCED LITTLE INTEREST IN ARMY TACTICS
lbi-7850-111771-0002 GRANT ACTED AS MUSTERING OFFICER UNTIL BEING COMMISSIONED COLONEL OF THE TWENTY FIRST ILLINOIS VOLUNTEERS HE TOOK THE FIELD
lbi-7850-111771-0003 GENERAL HALLECK IN SPEAKING OF THIS BATTLE SAID
lbi-7850-111771-0004 INDEED IF EVER A GENERAL DESERVED HONOR GRANT HAD WON IT HE HAD OPENED THE MISSISSIPPI TO NAVIGATION AND HAD CAPTURED NEARLY ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PRISONERS AND ARMS
lbi-7850-111771-0005 HE WAS NOW COMMANDER OF ALL THE FEDERAL FORCES
lbi-7850-111771-0006 THE CAPTURE OF LEE WAS A FAR MORE DIFFICULT UNDERTAKING
lbi-7850-111771-0007 TIME WORE AWAY AND ON THE NINTH OF APRIL EIGHTEEN SIXTY FIVE GRANT CAPTURED THE CONFEDERATE ARMY UNDER LEE THUS VIRTUALLY ENDING THE WAR
lbi-7850-111771-0008 WHEN HIS PUBLIC SERVICES WERE FINISHED HE STARTED IN COMPANY WITH HIS WIFE SON JESSE AND A FEW FRIENDS
lbi-7850-111771-0009 HIS SUCCESS SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN THE OUTGROWTH OF HARD STUDY AND ABILITY TO PERFORM THE MOST EXHAUSTIVE LABOR WITHOUT FATIGUE
lbi-7850-281318-0000 SOME ARE WONDERFULLY WROUGHT PRETTY LITTLE HOMES FOR BIRDIKINS
lbi-7850-281318-0001 INDEED IT IS NOT A NEST AT ALL ONLY THE BEGINNING OF ONE
lbi-7850-281318-0002 AND THERE IS AN OLD STORY ABOUT THIS WHICH I SHALL TELL YOU
lbi-7850-281318-0003 OH WHAT SHALL WE DO FOR A HOME
lbi-7850-281318-0004 AND THE POOR SILLY THINGS RUFFLED UP THEIR FEATHERS AND LOOKED MISERABLE AS ONLY A LITTLE BIRD CAN LOOK WHEN IT IS UNHAPPY
lbi-7850-281318-0005 SHE WAS INDEED A CLEVER BIRD
lbi-7850-281318-0006 SHE POPPED INTO HER NEW HOUSE AND SAT THERE COMFORTABLY PEERING OUT THROUGH THE WINDOW SLITS WITH HER SHARP LITTLE EYES
lbi-7850-281318-0007 AND SHE SAW THE OTHER BIRDS HOPPING ABOUT AND TWITTERING HELPLESSLY
lbi-7850-281318-0008 THEN ALL THE OTHER BIRDS CHIRPED EAGERLY YES YES LET US ASK HER TO TEACH US
lbi-7850-281318-0009 SO IN A GREAT COMPANY THEY CAME FLUTTERING HOPPING TWITTERING UP TO THE ELM TREE WHERE MOTHER MAGPIE NESTLED COMFORTABLY IN HER NEW HOUSE
lbi-7850-281318-0010 O WISE MOTHER MAGPIE DEAR MOTHER MAGPIE THEY CRIED TEACH US HOW TO BUILD OUR NESTS LIKE YOURS FOR IT IS GROWING NIGHT AND WE ARE TIRED AND SLEEPY
lbi-7850-281318-0011 THE MAGPIE SAID SHE WOULD TEACH THEM IF THEY WOULD BE A PATIENT DILIGENT OBEDIENT CLASS OF LITTLE BIRDS
lbi-7850-281318-0012 AND WHERE EACH BIRD PERCHED THERE IT WAS TO BUILD ITS NEST
lbi-7850-281318-0013 SHE BEGAN TO SHOW THEM HOW TO WEAVE THE BITS OF THINGS TOGETHER INTO NESTS AS THEY SHOULD BE MADE
lbi-7850-281318-0014 AND SOME OF THE BIRDS WHO WERE ATTENTIVE AND CAREFUL SOON SAW HOW IT WAS DONE AND STARTED NICE HOMES FOR THEMSELVES
lbi-7850-281318-0015 I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE WAY TO BEGIN
lbi-7850-281318-0016 CERTAINLY OF COURSE SCREAMED THE JACKDAW
lbi-7850-281318-0017 HERE WOOD PIGEON SAID MOTHER MAGPIE YOU MUST PLACE THOSE STICKS THROUGH AND ACROSS CRISS CROSS CRISS CROSS SO
lbi-7850-281318-0018 CRISS CROSS CRISS CROSS SO INTERRUPTED THE WOOD PIGEON
lbi-7850-281318-0019 YOU SAY YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT IT THEN GO ON AND FINISH YOUR NESTS BY YOURSELVES
lbi-7850-281318-0020 MUCH LUCK MAY YOU HAVE
lbi-7850-281318-0021 AND AWAY SHE FLEW TO HER OWN COSY NEST IN THE ELM TREE WHERE SHE WAS SOON FAST ASLEEP FORGETTING ALL ABOUT THE MATTER
lbi-7850-281318-0022 BUT THE WOOD PIGEON WAS IN THE WORST CASE OF THEM ALL
lbi-7850-281318-0023 FOR SHE HAD ONLY THE FOUNDATION LAID CRISS CROSS AS THE MAGPIE HAD SHOWN HER
lbi-7850-286674-0000 A PERSON WOULD THINK THAT AFTER A FAMILY HAD LIVED SO LONG IN A PLACE ALL THE NEIGHBORS WOULD BE FOND OF THEM YET IT IS NOT SO
lbi-7850-286674-0001 IT IS DISGRACEFUL
lbi-7850-286674-0002 THEY THOUGHT THE TROUBLE CAME FROM BAD BRINGING UP OR NO BRINGING UP AT ALL
lbi-7850-286674-0003 THEY ALWAYS ATE PLAIN FOOD AND PLENTY OF IT AND THEY NEVER ATE BETWEEN MEALS
lbi-7850-286674-0004 YOU WOULD THINK THAT WITH SIX LEGS APIECE AND THREE JOINTS IN EACH LEG THEY MIGHT WALK QUITE FAST YET THEY NEVER DID
lbi-7850-286674-0005 THEY DID NOT BREATHE IT INTO THEIR MOUTHS OR THROUGH GILLS BUT TOOK IT IN THROUGH SOME OPENINGS IN THE BACK PART OF THEIR BODIES
lbi-7850-286674-0006 BOTH LIPS ASKED THE LARVAE
lbi-7850-286674-0007 WELL OUR LOWER LIPS ANYWAY ANSWERED THE NYMPH
lbi-7850-286674-0008 OUR UPPER LIPS ARE SO SMALL THEY DON'T MATTER
lbi-7850-286674-0009 THEY KNEW THAT WHENEVER THEY STUCK OUT THEIR LOWER LIPS AT THE SMALL FISHES AND BUGS THEY SWAM AWAY AS FAST AS THEY COULD
lbi-7850-286674-0010 INDEED THE LOWER LIP OF A DRAGON FLY CHILD MIGHT WELL FRIGHTEN PEOPLE FOR IT IS FASTENED ON A LONG JOINTED ARM LIKE THING AND HAS PINCERS ON IT WITH WHICH IT CATCHES AND HOLDS ITS FOOD
lbi-7850-286674-0011 BUT SOMETIMES HE STRAIGHTENS THE JOINT AND HOLDS HIS LIP OUT BEFORE HIM AND THEN ITS PINCERS CATCH HOLD OF THINGS HE DOES THIS WHEN HE IS HUNGRY
lbi-7850-286674-0012 SCARED DAH WHO'S AFRAID ANSWERED HE
lbi-7850-286674-0013 HERE COMES THE SNAPPING TURTLE
lbi-7850-286674-0014 SURE ENOUGH THERE HE CAME THROUGH THE SHALLOW WATER HIS WET BACK SHELL PARTLY OUT OF IT AND SHINING IN THE SUNLIGHT
lbi-7850-286674-0015 THEY THOUGHT HE MIGHT BE GOING TO TAKE A NAP AFTER HIS DINNER
lbi-7850-286674-0016 HE BEGAN TO DRAW IN HIS LEGS VERY VERY SLOWLY AND JUST AS HIS GREAT HARD LOWER SHELL TOUCHED THE MUD THE LAST LARVA CRAWLED OUT UNDER HIS TAIL
lbi-7850-286674-0017 THE NYMPHS HAD ALREADY GOTTEN AWAY
