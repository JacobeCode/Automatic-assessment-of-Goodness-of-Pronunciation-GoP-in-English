023270098	I WANTED HIM TO DO IT HERE
023270118	TIME TO GET THE SECOND ONE
023270120	NO MATTER WHERE YOU GO THERE YOU ARE
023270140	I MADE UP MY MIND A LONG TIME AGO

023270161	LET GOD TAKE CARE OF THE REST
023270171	ACTUALLY I HAVE TO RUN

023270315	SHE FOLLOWED HIM WITH HER EYES
023270319	I WANT YOUR GOOD NOTHING SO MUCH AS THAT
023270321	SHE TOUCHED HIM ON THE CHECK WITH HER LIPS
023270331	BUT THEY HAD NO CHANCE TO FLY YET
023270364	I WANT TO DO SOMETHING GOOD WITH IT
023550002	THAT'S THE MINIMUM THAT WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE TO ME PERSONALLY
023550003	SPEAKER AFTER SPEAKER CALLED FOR AN END TO MILITARY RULE
023550008	I GET ALL MY MONEY FROM ABROAD
023550013	I DO WHAT I THINK IS FUNNY
023550099	BEFORE THEY GET DOWN TO ZERO
023550123	TODAY IS GOING TO BE A BUSY DAY
023550138	EDITOR AT FAN OF ROCK
023550167	THEY HAD A BIG TIME
023550175	OLD PEOPLE SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO DRIVE
023550201	THE MOST POWERFUL THING YOU CAN DO IS RECOVER
023550202	TODAY WAS THE START OF A REVOLUTION
023550230	ANGER IS SOMETHING THAT CAN BE REALLY HARD TO CONTROL
023550233	CHILL DOWN WITH THE TALENT
023550237	NOTE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE THIS THING
023550257	ALWAYS GOOD TO SEE A BRITISH PREMIERE
023550260	I THOUGHT IT'S WAS A FUN FACT
023550290	UNABLE TO CATCH THE JETS GAME
023550310	AT LEAST IT WILL BE THIS TERM
023550319	BUT I KNOW WHAT I MEAN
023550341	BUT SUCH ARE THE MILITARY

024380247	AT THE COST OF WHAT
024380265	THAT'S A BUCKET LIST GOAL

024380278	HAPPY BIRTHDAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR ALL YOU DO
024380315	IT WAS TIGHT FIT
024380317	AND THEN BY HIS GRAVE HIS EYES OPENED
024380325	THEN YOU MUST MAKE SOUP OUT OF THE SNAKES
024380354	THAT'S THE BEST GAME ALWAYS
024380363	I WAS NOT LEFT DRIFTING
024380369	HAD IT HAPPENED ON PURPOSE
024410049	I APOLOGIZE TO THE COURT
024410052	NO ONE SEEMS QUITE SURE IS THE PLAN WILL WORK
024410092	I THINK HE CAN LEAD US TO VICTORY AGAINST ANYBODY
024410098	HE IS ALSO AMONG THOSE TRYING TO LEARN HOW
024410110	HE WOULD REACH BACK AND GET A LITTLE SOMETHING EXTRA
024410149	WHAT DO YOU THINK OF MY STATUE
024410158	SOCIAL AND DOWN TO EARTH
024410160	FINISHED RISE OF THE LAST NIGHT
024410173	WONDER WHAT HE THINKS WE SHOULD DO WITH HIM
024410222	OR IT IS JUST ME AND WHO CARES
024410228	I KIND OF LIKE THIS SNOWSTORM
024410240	SO MUCH TO DO TOMORROW
024410241	WHY DO YOU WANT TO REPLACE HIM
024410294	IT'S PART OF THE SERIES
024410312	COLLEGE IS ALL ABOUT SETTING YOURSELF UP FOR THE FUTURE
024410318	LET HER HAVE HER OWN WAY FOR THE MOMENT
024410322	AND FOR THIS HE IS PUT TO SHAME
024410350	AND AS SUCH YOU NEED HELP
024410368	THE MOTIVE FOR THE CRIME IS NOT FAR TO SEEK
024410377	WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOUR EYES
024480016	BUT THERE WAS NO IMMEDIATE OFFICIAL COMMENT
024480028	I LOVED HER WITH ALL MY HEART
024480094	WE HAVE NO INTEREST IN ATTEMPTING TO DO THAT
024480095	THURSDAY IS THE LAST DAY OF THIS YEAR'S DEBATE
024480105	BUT IT MIGHT BE ALL ABOUT THE PHYSICAL PLAY
024480127	WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE FOR US TO DO AN INTERVIEW
024480159	IT IS A FORM OF SELFISHNESS
024480186	JUST TO HEAR HIS VOICE
024480188	HOPING THAT THEY ARE DOING THE SAME WITH THIS ONE
024480212	WHAT ABOUT THE SHAPE OF THE UNIVERSE
024480228	SO IN NEED OF A GOOD MOVIE
024480232	SOMETIMES THE BEST THING YOU CAN DO IS NOTHING
024480241	HE WAS TRYING TO KEEP YOU SAFE
024480244	LEARN THE WHY NOT JUST THE WHAT
024480251	IT'S NICE TO HAVE A BREAK
024480255	THEN IT'S TIME TO DO SOMETHING NEW
024480270	HAD A NICE DAY AT THE ZOO
024480292	LEARN TO BE COMFORTABLE WITH THE PRESSURE
024480297	I BELIEVE IN YOU YOU CAN MAKE IT HAPPEN
024480335	ARE YOU COMING TO BED
024510017	IT WAS TOUGH FOR US AT THE TIME
024510043	IT'S VERY MUCH PART OF MY INTIMATE LIFE
024510061	IT'S TOO PRECIOUS TO US TO LET IT DIE
024510070	IT'S ALL PART AND PARCEL OF NEW MANAGEMENT STYLE
024510114	TROOPS MOVE IN TO BREAK UP SOME STRIKES
024510164	WHERE IN SOUTH AFRICA ARE YOU FROM

024510252	SOMEONE WANT TO GO TO WORK FOR ME
024510275	OR DO YOU WANT ME TO
024510316	ONE LOOK WILL BE SUFFICIENT
024510323	NO ANGEL WOULD DO SUCH A THING
024510336	HUMANE DOCTORS MOST OF THEM
024510351	THE PROFESSOR TURNED DOWN THE SHEETS
024510352	THIS WAS THE GIRL HE HAD HAD DOUBTS OF
024510375	IT WAS A SMALL ROOM
024880041	THEY TALK ABOUT THE MOUNTAINS
024880059	EVERYTHING IS STILL AHEAD OF ME
024880070	HE WAS AT THE HEIGHT OF HIS POWER
024880098	THEY GET USED TO THE HEAT
024880118	LET'S MAKE SURE THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING
024880155	WOULD LOVE TO SEE YOU MAKE IT UP HERE

024880210	HE HAD TO GET OUT OF THE CARE CAR
024880234	INSTEAD YOU GIVE ME SUN
024880245	I DO NOT WANT TO PLAY THIS
024880258	DO YOU EVER THINK ABOUT THE THINGS YOU SAY

024880339	I WAS TRYING TO GUESS THE TIME
025380004	THERE WERE HATS BUTTONS AND RED WHITE AND BLUE BALLOONS
025380051	SHE WILL FIGHT AND WE ARE READY
025380065	I WANTED THIS TO END
025380091	IT IS AN INNER INTERNATIONAL WORD
025380107	HE WAS REPORTED IN GUARDED CONDITION TODAY
025380133	ADVICE AS FAR AS WHAT
025380149	WORK IS NOT ALL THAT TO LIFE
025380151	YES AND THE DEADLY ONE TOO
025380152	MEANWHILE IS IT PIG ROAST YET
025380158	PUTTING ALL OF US AT RISK OF A NUCLEAR WAR
025380162	BUT THERE WAS NO PROTEST
025380175	EVERYBODY IS GETTING READY FOR THEIR PITCH
025380202	SHOW THE PAY RICE VIDEO
025380217	WELL THAT WAS JUST RIDICULOUS
025380251	OR THE ONE WITH THE PHOTOGRAPHERS
025380256	I HAVE NO IDEA WHY IT'S POPULAR
025380277	YES IT WAS AN EARTHQUAKE
025380298	HOPE YOU ALL HAD A GOOD WEEKEND
025380340	HE HAD A MOMENT OF DOUBT
025380347	THEY ENTERED THROUGH THE OPENING ON THE BEACH
027400077	I THINK WE NEED THAT TYPE OF PERSON
027400094	ASK THEM IF THEY PLAN TO VOTE
027400125	IT'S A GAME OF CHEESE BABY
027400126	IT IS MUCH MORE THAN THIS
027400145	ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS EXECUTE
027400146	THANK YOU SO MUCH TO YOU AND THE TEAM

027400238	NEED TO FIND A WAY TO FIX THAT
027400246	TRULY IT WILL BE A NIGHT TO REMEMBER
027400276	THAT IS NOT A SALARY
027400283	CAN WE TALK ABOUT HAIR
027400286	LOVE MAKES ME FEEL ALIVE
027400289	IT WOULD BE A GREAT FOR US TO ADD HIM
027400295	SO YOU KNOW IS GOING TO BE FUN
027400321	I WALK INTO THE ROOM TRYING TO SMILE
027400372	SPRING AND THE BIRDS ARE COURTING
028920012	SENDING YOU LOVE AND BLESSINGS
028920027	I THINK HE'S IN A REAL BIND
028920044	ONE WAS KILLED AND THE OTHER WAS WOUNDED
028920050	THOSE ARE FAITH FAMILY AND FREEDOM
028920120	HE'S BETTER THAN A TANK
028920122	HOPE YOU HAD A GOOD MEAL
028920128	SO DO YOU NOT HAVE IT
028920131	AND WE NEED TO KEEP FIGHTING FOR IT
028920174	THIS IS AN OLD PATTERN
028920200	I CAN HARDLY WAIT TO SEE THIS
028920207	MY HEART IS FULL OF LOVE
028920213	THEY MADE IT EASY TO FIND EVERYTHING
028920214	I AM READY TO MOVE UP AND ON
028920224	WE SHOULD BE MORE SELFISH
028920235	I THINK YOU CAN TAKE IT YOURSELF
028920239	WHAT WE WANT TO HEAR TODAY
028920242	WANT TO GET RID OF THOSE DARK SPOTS
028920259	I WANTED HER TO BE MY DAUGHTER
028920315	MAY PASSED IN A BLAZE OF SUNSHINE
028920321	WHAT COULD HAVE MADE HIM
028970002	WHY WOULD I WANT TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT
028970016	HE MAY COME BACK TOMORROW WITH ANOTHER OFFER WHO KNOWS
028970022	IT COULD BE DISMISSED BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING THERE
028970039	SO FAR NO ONE IS EXPECTED TO LOSE THEIR JOB
028970052	THE STORM HIT ABOUT AN HOUR LATER
028970057	BOTH PLAYERS HOWEVER WERE AFFECTIES IN THE FOURTH QUARTER
028970088	I AM GOING TO LEARN

028970294	WELL THAT IS A VERY FAIR POINT
028970329	I SHOUTED AS I JUMPED OUT OF THE TRUCK
029170012	THAT'S THE KIND OF PERSON I LIKE TO DEAL WITH
029170043	I BELIEVE I'M THE RIGHT PERSON FOR THE JOB
029170055	THE GENERAL CONCLUSION WAS THAT IT IS NOT THAT SIMPLE
029170086	IT WAS A GREAT PLAY
029170104	OIL PRICES ALSO ROSE SHARPLY
029170149	BUT DO YOU HAVE IT IN BLACK

029170321	YES BY THE MEMORY OF MY FATHERS
029170359	I WAS TRANSFERRED FROM ONE MASTER TO ANOTHER
029170362	BUT HE WAS CAREFUL NOT TO SHOW IT
029370015	IT'S DO OR DIE FOR THEM
029370032	THE IDEAS OF COURSE ARE NOT NOT NEW
029370040	POLICE HAVE YET TO CHARGE ANYONE IN BOMBINGS
029370106	THIS IS NOT AN ARGUMENT FOR BUSINESS AS USUAL
029370108	HE CALLED FOR EDUCATION CAMPAIGN TARGETING THE ISSUE OF WEAPONS
029370123	BUT YOU KNOW WHAT'S COOL
029370126	WHO IS MOST BEAUTIFUL IN THEM
029370142	AND BY THEN IT WILL BE TOO LATE

060670094	THE COWS NEVER GAVE SO MUCH MILK AS THAT NIGHT
060670111	I KNOCKED AT THE DOOR AND ENTERED
060670140	BUT HE DID NOT MIND IT
060670144	AND THESE MEN WOULD LET HER GO AGAIN
060670149	DID HE LOVE HER
060990011	TO BE SURE YOU DID
060990014	THIS IS WHAT ALL MEN DO
060990023	SHE SAID SHE WOULD SEE HER
060990029	IN THE EVENING I WENT AGAIN WHEN I SAW HIM

060990129	BUT THERE IS NO CRY OF HELPING
060990155	AND HE HELD ALL THE HAND
060990168	BUT IN THE NAME OF WONDER WHY

069020048	BUT THEY CAN'T LAST
069020059	THEY DID NOT SEE THEM ANY MORE
069020065	SO I WENT AWAY AND SAID NOTHING

085810119	HE PUT THE THING BACK INTO THE DRIVER
085810120	WE HAD A LETTER FROM HIM THIS MORNING
085810121	THERE WAS NO EXCEPTION TO HIS RULE
085810152	IT WOULD BE FUNNY SO FUNNY
085810159	HE TURNED ROUND AND LOOKED UP THE ROAD
085810163	COME BACK HERE A MOMENT
085810167	THAT IS TO SAY I'M GOING TO SLEEP
085840013	SO PREPARE FOR THIS VERY VERY NIGHT
085840020	IT WAS ONLY ONE BY THE PAST THAT MORNING
085840022	I MUST FIND OUT LATER ON
085840036	HAD THE MOMENT REALLY COME
085840040	I KNOW THAT MY DEAR BOY
085840059	I'M NOT GOOD WITHOUT MY CUP OF TEA MY DEAR
085840072	HE MAY BE ABLE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING
085840075	THERE WAS SOME DIFFERENCE BETWEEN US
085840077	LOOK NOW AT THE PATH BELOW US
085840086	AND IN THAT YOU ANSWERED ME
085840089	THE REPORT MAY BE THIS TIME TRAIN
085840092	THIS DESK IS YOUR ROCK SIR
085840099	I ASK YOU IS SUCH A MAN FREE
085840115	HE WOULD NOT KEEP YOU MORE THAN A MOMENT
085840117	HOW BIG IS YOUR HOUSE
085840123	NOW WELL I REMEMBER EVERY MOMENT OF THE CENSE
085840141	IF I GIVE THE WORD YOU STAY ON
085840147	I AS A WOMAN THINK DIFFERENTLY
085840157	I BELIEVE IN THE FIGHT WHICH IS IN EVERYTHING
085840167	HE SEEMED A VERY GOOD WOMAN NEAR FIFTY YEARS GOOD
090880018	IS THIS ANYTHING TO ME
090880060	YOU ARE NO LONGER KIND
090880064	EVEN THIS IS MORE THAN WE CAN SAY
090880065	OF COURSE THERE ARE TWO SIDES TO THE QUESTION
090880086	WILL YOU BE READY AT ONCE NOW
090880090	THEY HAD TO SUPPORT HIM AND PUT HIM TO BED
090880093	I MADE MY VOICE SOUNDS CARELESS
090880095	AMERICA'S GOING THROUGH JUST ABOUT THE SAME EXPERIENCE AS MYSELF
090880100	AND NOW YOU EXPECT THAT SHE SHOULD DO SO
090880120	THINK OF ME AS THROUGH I WERE YOU SISTER
090880126	HE IS WORSE THAN LAST YEAR
090880130	DO YOU REALLY AND TRULY SAY SO
090880132	I SHALL DO MY PARKING
090880140	NOW LET ME HAVE YOUR ATTENTION
090880142	THESE WERE NOT THE ALL MOST IMPORTANT THING HOWEVER
090880145	IT WAS AS STILL AS DEATH
090880147	CAN I TRUST MY OWN EARS
090880154	IF NOT WE MUST BREAK IT OFF
090880157	THE NAMES REMAINING WERE CALLED IN THE SAME MANNER
090880163	I'LL DO NOTHING UNTIL I HAVE READ THE ANSWER
091010017	HE IS BURNING TO HAVE AT SOMEBODY
091010032	IT WANTS WHOLE BOAT TO ITSELF
091010049	ENGLISH LIFE IN THEM THERE WAS NONE
091010050	HE SENDS ME FOR THAT PURPOSE AND HERE I AM
091010055	SHE TRY AND SHE SUCCEED
091010063	WE NEED NOT STAY UNLESS YOU LIKE
091010070	BUT ENGLISH ARE FOOLS
091010072	IF YOU MAKE ANY NOISE WE ARE LOST
091010082	HE IS RICH MAN
091010100	HE ASKED ME IF I WOULD WAIT FOR HIS RETURN
091010107	IF YOU NOT MORE THAN TEN I WILL MAKE FIGHT
091010109	BUT YOU HAD BEST WASTE NO TIME ON QUESTIONS
091010123	HOWEVER YOU CAN PUT IT ON NOW
091010127	THERE SEEMED A WALL IN FRONT OF HIM
091010133	SHOULD HE EVER SEE HER AGAIN
091010138	COVERED WITH SHAME SHE COULD MAKE NO ANSWER
091010139	OTHER FURNITURE THERE WAS NONE
091010142	WE WERE ONCE MORE AT HOME
091010149	EACH MAN HAD A PIECE OF SOAP AND A TOWEL
091010151	COME IT WOULD GIVE ME SO MUCH PLEASURE
091070001	THE LAST STAGE WAS REACHED
091070033	SHE IS SO GENTLE AND SWEET
091070038	IF ANY MAN EVER LOVED A GIRL SHE LOVED YOU
091070040	BECAUSE EVEN NOW THINGS MIGHT TURN OUT DIFFERENTLY
091070049	THERE IS OUR STARTING POINT
091070056	THAT WAS THE REASON OF HIS GOING
091070061	THE SHOCK WAS TOO MUCH FOR HIM
091070065	I HAD NOT THE HEART TO KILL HER
091070074	AND THE WHOLE COURT WAS PLACED UNDER HIS ORDERS
091070089	I LIFTED MY HEAD AND KISSED HER
091070108	I WOULD TRUST HIM AS I COULD TRUST MYSELF
091070135	YOU WIN THE PRIZE YOU SEE
091070138	MAYBE A LOT OF PEOPLE
091070140	YOU HAVE NO NEED TO TROUBLE YOURSELF TO COME
091070142	YOU START A QUESTION AND IT'S LIKE STARTING A STONE
091070143	SHE SENDS YOUR HER REGARD
091070162	THEN THIS WAS THE SECRET OF IT ALL
091070163	AND I WOULD HAVE KISSED YOU
091070174	ITS BEAUTY IS THE BEAUTY OF HIS OWN MIND
091070175	I SEE YOU ALL SWING IN A ROPE
091180015	HE IS TRULY A GOOSE AND NOT A DUCK
091180025	I WONDER IF SATURDAY WILL EVER COME
091180035	YES YOU WILL SEE HERE HAVE SPEECH WITH HERE
091180042	THREE WERE HAS BAD HAS HIMSELF
091180044	WHERE YOU NOT ABLE TO BUY ANYTHING FROM THEM
091180050	SHE WANTS TO ASK YOU HERSELF
091180056	SOMETHING TERRIBLE WAS IN PREPARATION
091180064	DO YOU EVER TRY ME
091180075	AS LONG AS YOU FIND ME WORK I WILL REMAIN
091180078	BECAUSE I SEE YOUR BODY ACTING IN A CERTAIN WAY
091180088	I TURNED MY EYES ROUND AS FAR AS WAS POSSIBLE
091180091	WOULD THE GENTLEMAN STATE HIS BUSINESS PLEASE
091180101	LAST TIME I WAS YOUR JEST
091180110	SHALL YOU STATE AT ONCE
091180133	HERE IS AN INSTANCE OF THIS FEELING
091180151	I SAVED MY CHICKENS THROUGH
091180157	DEATH IS ONLY A RETURN HIM AFTER ALL
091180159	THERE MUST BE AN END OF THIS
091180161	NOTHING REMAINS FOR US BUT WAIT AND HOPE
091180163	HE CAN ALMOST STAND ON HIS LEGS
095530005	I WISH I HAD NONE BUT MY OWN TO TELL
095530010	BE SEATED IF YOU PLEASE SIR
095530011	SHE WALKED THROUGH THE HOUSE
095530016	ALL OTHER TIME IS PEACE
095530028	BUT MIGHT NOT HE GET ANOTHER LESSON FROM THEM
095530041	SHE BELONGED TO HIM AND HE TO HER
095530049	BUT AT DINNER THERE WERE PLANS TO BE MADE
095530059	WHAT A GREATLY IT WAS
095530066	BUT THAT WOULD NOT ALONE EXPLAIN HIS PLEASURE
095530082	HE WAS FOR MOMENTS TURNED TO STONE BEFORE IT
095530083	BUT WHAT CAN BE THEIR AM
095530085	I HAVE HOWEVER FOUND THE FOLLOWING
095530116	HE SEEMED TO BE TALKING TO HIMSELF
095530118	BUT WHAT IS THE POINT OF IT
095530129	IF IT BE ON THE FINGER TAKE THE FINGER OFF
095530144	HE REACHED OVER AND TOUCHED HER HAND
095530152	HE COULD PAY NO ATTENTION
095530154	HE HAD ALMOST LOST HER
095530161	I KNOW THAT WAS UNDERSTANDING
095530173	I WANT THE TRUTH THE TRUTH
095550027	EVERYTHING IS AN EVENT AT SEA
095550043	AND THERE IS WORSE BEHIND
095550044	I SAW THE KEY WAS IN THE LOCK OUTSIDE
095550046	HE SITS BY HER SIDE FOR HOURS
095550051	WHAT CARE I IF SHE SHE SINK OR SWIM
095550053	WHO WOULD EVER WANT ONE OF THIS COLLECTION
095550073	SO FAR THEY WERE IN PERFECT AGREEMENT
095550075	THE LIFT HAD STOPPED AT THEIR FLOOR
095550081	AM I WORSE THAN YOU
095550082	HE DRESSED IT HIMSELF TWICE A DAY
095550092	DO ANYTHING BUT COME DOWNSTAIRS WITH ME
095550100	FROM THE COURT THE NEWS SOON REACHED THE TOWN
095550107	WE ARE BUT YOUNG ONCE
095550116	IT IS ALWAYS SAFE TO TRUST HIM
095550126	WOULD YOU EAT YOUR CAKE TWICE
095550134	HE SIGNED TO HER TO LISTEN
095550143	ALL THE SAME YOU MUST NOT REMAIN HERE
095550146	WE MIGHT PICK UP SOME POINTS
095550148	AND THAT MAKES IT WORSE
095550173	I THINK WE MAY EXPECT HIM BEFORE MORNING
095580008	I WILL TELL YOU THE STORY OF HIS DEATH
095580012	SHE WAS JUST IN TIME TO HEAR THE DIRECTION
095580016	IT WOULD HAVE SPARED ME ALL THIS WORRY
095580039	IF THIS WERE TRUE WHO COULD BE UNHAPPY
095580045	I SHALL NEVER GETS THE ANY INTEREST FOR MY MONEY
095580056	THERE ARE NONE SUCH IN THIS PARTY
095580067	WHEN YOU ASKED ME TO HIDE YOU
095580071	THE SECOND WAS RATHER LESS SIMPLE BUT NOT MUCH LONGER
095580078	AND THEIR END WAS THE SAME
095580088	PUT THESE CONSIDERATIONS BEFORE HER FROM ME THEN
095580097	I THOUGHT YOU WERE SURE THAT HE WAS GUILTY
095580099	WEIGH THE OFFERS THEY WILL MAKE YOU
095580101	BUT THIS IS ASKING FOR THE WORLD AND NOTHING LESS
095580102	HE BOWED AND WALKED OUT OF THE ROOM
095580116	SEE THEM AND HEAR WHAT THEY CAN ADD
095580128	IT IS YOUR DUTY MY SON
095580133	I THINK THAT SHE HAD NO CAUSE TO LEAVE ME
095580157	SHE IS A GIRL WITH A LOT OF TALENT
095580166	I SHALL PUT HIM IN THE ADVERTISEMENT THIS TIME
095580173	THIS MESSAGE GIVES ME HOPE
096010001	THERE WAS NO WAY SHE COULD USE IT
096010002	HE PUT DOWN HIS STERN AND LOOKED AGAIN
096010004	SHE OPENED HER EYES STARING UP AT HIM
096010005	BUT HE CAN DO THINGS BUT THIS
096010006	I WONDER THAT WE WERE STILL SO LONG
096010007	YOU MAY NOT WANT TO KNOW
096010008	SO HE CALLED AND ASKED ONE MORE TIME
096010009	AND THEN THERE WAS SILENCE FOR A MOMENT OR TWO
096010010	SHE TURNED AWAY FROM ME AND SUDDENLY BACK
096010011	THAT YOU LOVE ME AS MUCH AS I LOVE YOU
096010012	IT WAS SIMPLE ENOUGH IF THEY HAD ONLY THOUGHT
096010013	WHAT HE SAW ABOUT HER THAT MADE HER SPECIAL
096010015	I TAKE THE TIME TO LOOK THE DOG OVER
096010016	HE IS THE BEST COOK IN THE WORLD TOO
096010018	THE OTHER WAS A GIRL AS WELL
096010019	THEY WALKED THE REST OF THE DAY AND ALL NIGHT
096010020	SOMEWHERE THERE HAD TO BE A PLACE BETTER THAN THIS
096010021	HE SHRUGGED ME OFF LIKE I WAS NOTHING
096010022	IT IS NOT THE FACE HE KNOWS THOUGH
096010023	YOU FEEL LIKE A LITTLE BROTHER TO ME
096080003	YOU MUST NOT THINK OF THE PAST NOW
096080005	SHE WISHED THAT SHE HAD NEVER COME HERE
096080006	THEY WERE ALREADY IN AND SEEMED LIKE THEY SAW NOTHING
096080007	THE SAME LOOK OF CONFUSION IS ON HIS FACE
096080008	THERE WAS NO WAY WE COULD GET OUT
096080009	BUT STILL I WOULD DO MY BEST
096080010	SO THIS WAS ALL OVER HIM
096080012	AND THERE SHE WAS WITH ANOTHER MAN
096080013	I KNOW YOU JUST AS WELL AS YOU KNOW YOURSELF
096080014	IT WAS SOMETHING MORE THAN THAT
096080015	SHE HAVE TO MAKE UP THINGS IF EVER
096080017	SHE CLOSED HER EYES AND THOUGHT BACK
096080018	WE TALKED ALL NIGHT AGAIN ABOUT THIS AND THAT
096080021	WHAT WAS THERE AFTER THIS WHICH HE MIGHT NOT DO
096080022	HE REACHED FOR HER HAND SHE LET HIM TAKE IT
096080023	I SUPPOSE IT IS BETTER THAT YOU SHOULD TELL ME
096080024	THE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE RESTAURANT WERE LOOKING AT US
096080025	HE WATCHES ME DAY IN AND DAY OUT
096080026	THAT WAS THE LAST TIME I SAW MY FATHER
096080027	YOU HAVE TO CHANGE WITH THEM OR BE LEFT BEHIND
096100001	SHE WAS FACE TO FACE WITH ONE OF THE HORSE
096100002	BUT HOW COULD SHE HAVE NOT KNOWN THAT
096100003	ACTUALLY THERE IS SOMETHING YOU CAN DO FOR ME
096100004	HE PULLED IT OUT AND LOOKED AT IT
096100005	SHOULD I KNOW HER AGAIN IF I SAW HER
096100006	AND THEN HE HAD A BETTER IDEA
096100007	COULD THIS GIRL BE LIKE HIM IN SOME WAY
096100008	IT WAS STILL ON HIS BACK
096100009	WE ALL WERE A LITTLE
096100010	SHE JUST NEVER WANTED TO TALK ABOUT IT EVEN NOW
096100011	I MADE UP MY MIND TO GO AT ONCE
096100012	NONE OF THEM HAD THOUGHT TO LOOK BEHIND THE DOOR
096100013	IF SO WHAT WAS IT
096100014	THIS TIME I WAS RIGHT
096100015	HE TURNED HIS HEAD AWAY FROM HER
096100016	I ACTUALLY THINK WE MIGHT MAKE IT OUT OF THIS
096100017	THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT FOR ME
096100018	WHAT KIND OF PERSON WOULD SHE COME TO BE
096100019	IT WAS WHEN I WAS VERY YOUNG
096100020	I ASKED TO BE SURE
096120001	SHE SAW IT ALL IN A MOMENT
096120002	I WANT TO SEE HIM MYSELF
096120003	THERE WAS REALLY NO WINNING WITH HER WAS THERE
096120004	AND THEN SOMETHING KNOCKED ME OUT OF THE WAY
096120005	HE HAD THOUGHT THEY WOULD NEVER COME BACK
096120006	BUT WHAT TRICK DO YOU HAVE FOR US NOW
096120007	IT IS GOING TO BE SO MUCH FUN
096120008	I LOOKED OVER AT THEM
096120009	IF SHE WANTED TO SHE COULD BE VERY POPULAR
096120010	THEY HAD TO LET GO
096120011	BUT WE LOOKED LIKE THAT A LONG LONG TIME AGO
096120012	HE TURNED AROUND AND WALKED AWAY TO THE PLATFORM
096120013	I AM A PLAIN MAN AND SAY WHAT I THINK
096120014	THIS WAS THE PLACE ALL RIGHT
096120015	HE SHOULD BE ABLE TO SEE IT FROM HERE
096120016	HE WAS STILL AT HOME
096120017	HE ASKED HER ONE DAY
096120018	SHE HAD NOTHING BETTER TO DO THAT NIGHT
096120019	HE WAS FACE TO FACE WITH THE GIRL
096120020	BUT THAT IS AT AN END
096170001	SHE WAS JUST LIKE HE WAS
096170002	THEN ON OUT THE BACK DOOR OF THE HOUSE
096170003	HE LOOKED HERE AND THERE
096170004	YOU MAY NOT BE WHO YOU THINK YOU ARE
096170006	BUT NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME SOMETHING HAD MESSED UP
096170007	AND ONCE MORE SHE WAS ALL HIS OWN
096170008	IT NEVER HAPPENED AND IT NEVER WILL
096170009	THEY ALL GIVE THEM TO HIM
096170010	THERE WAS NO OTHER WAY AROUND IT
096170011	THIS WAS THE THING SHE WANTED TO HEAR ONLY THIS
096170012	WE ARE GOING TO DO NOTHING ABOUT IT
096170013	NO DOUBT HE WAS VERY GOOD AND ALL THAT
096170014	SHE WALKED OUT OF THE ROOM AGAIN
096170015	HE TURNED AND ASKED THEM
096170018	HE WAS TALENTED IN MORE THINGS THAN I WAS
096170020	SHE WAS LOOKING AWAY FROM HIM AT THE FIRE
096170021	SO THAT IS WHAT I WANT TO BE CALLED
096170022	AND EVEN AFTER THAT IT IS NOT MUCH BETTER
096170023	I LEFT THIS PLACE BECAUSE OF HIM
096170024	NOW SHE HAD TO DO THE SAME
096180001	AND SHE WAS INTIMATE WITH HIM AS AT FIRST
096180002	IT IS OVER IN A MOMENT
096180004	THEY WERE ON MY SIDE OF THE STREAM NOW
096180005	HE COULD NEVER SEE HER BEFORE
096180007	YOU STILL NEED TO GET OUT OF THIS PLACE
096180008	WHAT DO YOU THINK WHAT CAN BE THERE
096180009	THERE WAS A MAN BEHIND ME
096180010	THAT WAS JUST HOW SHE WAS
096180011	THIS IS THE WAY OF LIFE
096180012	AS IF SHE HAD SOMETHING ON HER MIND
096180013	I WANTED TO FIND MORE OUT ABOUT YOU
096180014	I ALWAYS THOUGHT HE WAS A GOOD PERSON
096180015	WE COULD PUT YOU IN A WORLD OF HURT
096180016	BUT NOT VERY LONG WAS SHE LEFT IN DOUBT
096180017	SHE LET GO OF HIS HAND AND RUBBED HER EYES
096180018	I JUST WANT TO SEE HER SAFE IN YOUR HANDS
096180019	BUT HERE IT IS THAT I MUST MAKE MY CONFESSION
096180020	AND THEN THERE WAS AN END OF IT
096180021	I ASKED NOT EVEN LOOKING UP AT HIM
096180022	HE HAD CALLED THEM THAT HIMSELF IN HIS DAY
096220001	YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT AND YOU ALWAYS WILL BE
096220002	HE LOOKED BACK AT ME
096220003	SHE THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT
096220004	THERE WAS NO ONE ELSE SHE WANTED BY HER SIDE
096220005	BUT WHAT IF WHAT THEY WERE DOING WAS RIGHT
096220006	IT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM BEFORE
096220007	I AM NOT GOING OUT WITH YOU
096220008	THIS WAS NO TIME TO THINK ABOUT THE REAL WORLD
096220009	I TURNED TO FACE THEM
096220010	BUT IT CAN DO SO MUCH MORE THAN THAT
096220011	THEN THEY WERE AT THE SAME THING AGAIN
096220012	HE CLOSED HIS EYES AS HE WALKED
096220013	I ASKED IF THEY WERE IN A FIGHT OR SOMETHING
096220014	NO NO HE WAS TOO GOOD A WORKMAN FOR THAT
096220015	HE PUT HER DOWN AND PATTED HER ON THE HEAD
096220016	WE WOULD HAVE TO FIND SOME WAY OF HIDING IT
096220017	I HAD LEFT IT BEHIND
096220018	SHE TURNED AWAY WITH A LITTLE WAVE OF THE HAND
096220019	BUT LOOK AT YOU TWO
096220020	WHAT WAS HE LIKE IN PERSON
096230001	HE LOOKED AT ME AND SMILED AND I SMILED BACK
096230002	SHE WANTED TO GET OUT
096230004	IT WAS JUST A PERSON
096230005	THIS WAS WHERE SHE HAD LEFT THEM
096230006	THERE WAS NO NEED FOR HIM TOO
096230007	WHAT WOULD IT BE LIKE THEN
096230008	THE TIME OF THE DAY
096230009	I COULD NOW SEE INTO HIS FACE
096230010	AND I NEVER THOUGHT A THING
096230011	THEY STOPPED AND HE WAS LET GO
096230012	I LOOK DOWN AND KNOW THE MAN IS DEAD
096230013	HOW LONG WAS HE GOING TO BE HERE
096230014	THERE WAS NOTHING IN IT FROM SIDE TO SIDE
096230015	THEN SHE TURNED TO ALL OF US
096230016	THAT WOULD MEAN THEY WOULD HAVE TO TAKE IT OVER
096230017	I WAS TIRED AND HAD OTHER THINGS ON MY MIND
096230018	WE MUST THINK OF THE GOOD AND NOT THE EVIL
096230019	NO IT WAS THE EYES
096230020	HE PUT HIS HAND ON THE KNOB AND OPENED IT
096230021	I STILL HAD NO IDEA WHO HE WAS
096260002	I LOOKED OVER AT HIM
096260003	IT WAS JUST YOU LAST TIME
096260004	THERE IS NO WAY I CAN GET BY THIS
096260005	BUT HOW WOULD THEY GO ABOUT IT
096260006	THEY ALL SMILED AT THE WORLD AROUND THEM
096260007	YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO COME WITH US NOW
096260008	NOW THERE WAS ONLY ONE THING LEFT TO DO
096260009	HE THEN WALKED FROM THERE OUT OF THAT ROOM
096260011	HE HAD NOTHING BUT THIS PLACE
096260012	HE STILL COULD NOT SEE ANYTHING
096260013	WE HAD TO MAKE IT
096260014	I NEED TO BE HERE
096260015	I SEEMED TO BE THE FIRST ONE DOWN
096260016	I HAD TO FIND A DIFFERENT BACK DOOR
096260017	HE HAD NO IDEA WHAT PEOPLE WOULD SAY
096260018	I PUT MY HAND ON IT
096260019	IT WAS TOO DARK TO SEE WHO IT WAS
096260020	THAT ALL I CAN EVER BE
096260021	AND THERE WAS AN END OF IT
096260022	HE WAS MORE THAN JUST A FATHER
096290001	HE WAS GOING TO HELP HIM
096290002	WHAT I DO KNOW IS THIS
096290004	SHE SMILED AT THE TIME
096290005	THEN IT WOULD ALL BE OVER
096290006	THAT HE COULD HAVE A HOME AGAIN
096290007	THERE WAS ONE RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME
096290008	BUT THEY WERE TURNED TO HIS LEFT
096290009	I THOUGHT FOR SURE SHE WOULD SAY SOMETHING
096290010	I WALKED UP TO MY ROOM
096290011	I CAN GET HER BACK
096290012	THE BOY LOOKED FROM THE HAND TO HER
096290014	HE SAW THE DAY WHEN IT HAD ALL HAPPENED
096290015	SHE ASKED LOOKING UP AT ME
096290016	I MADE IT TO HER HOUSE
096290017	I WAS STILL FOR A MOMENT
096290018	THIS WAS THE WAY IT SHOULD ALWAYS BE
096290020	SHE STOPPED WHERE SHE WAS AND LOOKED AROUND
096290021	AND THE FIRST THOUGH IN MY HEAD WAS
096290022	AND THAT WAS THE LAST I EVER SAW OF HIM
096290023	IT WAS NOT YET TIME
096310001	HE COULD BUT WHAT WOULD HE DO
096310002	SHE SMILED FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT DAY
096310003	THERE WAS SOMETHING IN FRONT OF HER
096310004	IT WILL ONLY BE A MOMENT
096310005	THE WOMAN LOOKED UP TO HIM
096310006	THIS IS ALL I CAN SAY
096310007	BUT THE EYES WERE RIGHT
096310008	HE TURNED HIS HEAD TO LOOK AT THEM
096310009	I HAVE BETTER GET OUT OF HERE
096310010	AND THEN THERE WAS HER FACE
096310011	HE ALWAYS SAW IF SHE WANTED HIM NOT TO
096310012	I THOUGHT MY LIFE WAS ABOUT TO END
096310013	WHAT WOULD THEY BE LIKE TO WORK WITH
096310014	NOW ARE YOU GOING TO LET ME GO
096310015	I PUT THEM BACK ON AND LEFT
096310016	THAT WAS AS MUCH AS HE WOULD GIVE HER
096310017	THEY OPENED IT AND WALKED IN
096310018	I THINK IT WILL DO US ALL SOME GOOD
096310019	THE THING HAD COME AND SO IT MUST BE
096310020	HE WAS NEVER EVEN IN THE ROOM
096330003	HE LOOKED AT HER AND TURNED AWAY
096330005	I WILL FIND THEM FOR YOU
096330006	IT WAS LIKE THEY WERE ONE PERSON
096330007	THERE ARE GOING TO BE MORE
096330008	YOU NEED TO COME WITH ME
096330009	I WOULD NEVER HAVE LEFT
096330010	THEY HAD TO GET OUT OF THERE
096330011	THIS WAS NOT IN HIS MIND
096330012	WE WERE THE SAME I OPENED MY EYES
096330013	BUT HOW CAN SHE TELL WHO IT WAS
096330014	I JUST WANT HER BACK
096330015	THE GIRL WALKED IN AND LOOKED AROUND
096330016	HE WAS ALWAYS UP TO NO GOOD
096330017	IT WAS ONLY ONE AFTER ALL I SAY
096330018	THAT DAY WAS THE FIRST TIME I SAW HIM
096330019	AS IF TO BE BUT A MAN WERE NOTHING
096330020	BUT THEN AGAIN THIS WAS HER HOUSE
096330021	HE WAS NOT HARD TO SEE FROM WHERE SHE WAS
096330022	I DO LOVE YOU AND I CAN MAKE THINGS RIGHT
096330023	IT WAS AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FRONT DOOR
096350006	THERE IS NO END TO THIS IS THERE
096350007	SHE WANTED TO KNOW MORE ABOUT HIM
096350008	IT SHOULD AS HE WAS ONE AFTER ALL
096350009	AND SHE WAS THE ONLY PERSON LEFT
096350010	THE OTHER AT THE BACK OF HIS HEAD
096350011	I WILL FIND OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON
096350012	HE ASKED IF I WOULD LIKE TO SEE MY FATHER
096350013	IT MADE ME WANT TO GET AWAY FROM HIM
096350014	I COULD NEVER GIVE YOU UP
096350015	IF IT BE SO I HAD BETTER GO
096350016	I PUT THEM ON AND I SAW WHERE WE WERE
096350018	I AM SURE YOU CAN DO IT
096350019	THEY ALL LOOK THE SAME TO YOU
096350020	AND YOU COME BEFORE THAT
096350021	BUT THEN I THOUGHT THERE WAS LITTLE NEED
096350023	BUT NOW I SEE WHO YOU REALLY ARE
096350024	IT WAS NOT HER PLACE TO SAY ANYTHING
096350025	I COULD FEEL HER EYES LOOKING AT ME
096350026	I LOOKED OVER TO THE SIDE
096350027	SHE TURNED TO FACE THE MAN
096400001	WAS IT POSSIBLE TO INTERPRET THEM TO ANY USEFUL PURPOSE
096400002	NOT A LIVING CREATURE WAS VISIBLE
096400004	AND AFTER HE LEFT I FEEL EMPTY
096400006	THE RECEIVER HAD NOT SUFFERED AT ALL
096400007	WE WILL TAKE TURNS IN WRITING EACH CHAPTER
096400008	DEATH SHOULD BE VEILED THE GRAVE SHOULD HAVE ITS RESERVE
096400010	THEY WERE SILVER WITH NO PUPIL
096400012	TOO LONG TOO SHORT TOO BORING
096400013	TROOPS ARE MARCHING INTO BATTLE
096400014	WAITING FOR WHAT SHE THOUGHT
096400016	HER EYES USUALLY SO GENTLE FLASHED FIRE
096400018	PLEASE FORGIVE ME MY FRIEND
096400019	THAT'S WHY WE BOTH PASSED OUT
096400020	AUTHOR NOTE HELLO AGAIN EVERYONE
096400021	EVERY MINUTE SEEMED LIKE AN HOURS
096400022	ALL HEADS TURNED THEIR WAY
096400024	BUT THIS WANTS FARTHER EXPLANATION
096400025	MY OWN OWN DARLING DARLING DARLING JEWEL
096400026	YOU MAY CONTINUE GUN TRAINING
096400028	IT'S ALMOST PAST YOUR BED TIME
096470002	AT THIS SHE LAUGHED AND SEEMED QUITE SATISFIED
096470003	A THIRD FINISHED WELL THERE YOU HAVE IT
096470004	THIS WAS LIKE STRIKING THEIR FLAG
096470005	BOTH GIRLS CALLED OUT AS THEY WATCHED HER LEAVE
096470007	WERE THESE YOUNG PEOPLE EVIL
096470008	YOU CAN JUMP WITHOUT ME
096470010	IF THAT EVER HAPPENS THAT IS
096470011	NOTHING BUT AN IMMENSE SEA
096470012	THEY WERE PROBABLY DATING OR SOMETHING HE SHRUGGED
096470013	WOMAN NO IT'S ALL RIGHT
096470014	EXTREMELY LONG TIME NO WRITE
096470015	THE FIRST MAY BE THUS EXPLAINED

096470018	ANYWAY THANKS FOR YOUR HELP
096470019	MY FATHER'S VOICE SOUNDED TENSE
096470020	MAYBE WE SHOULD GET SOME CAKE
096470021	MORE THAN USUAL AT ANY RATE
096470022	HER MIND STARTED FORGETTING EVERYTHING
096470023	HIS HEAD HURT EVEN WORSE
