lbi-4831-25894-0005 SHE THANKED TOMMO AND RAN AWAY TO GET READY FOR SHE FELT SURE HER FATHER WOULD NOT REFUSE HER ANYTHING
lbi-4831-25894-0006 THEN SHE WASHED OUT LITTLE RANZA'S FROCK AND PUT IT TO DRY BECAUSE SHE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO DO IT THE NEXT DAY
lbi-4831-25894-0007 SHE LONGED TO MAKE THE BEDS AND DRESS THE CHILDREN OVER NIGHT SHE WAS IN SUCH A HURRY TO HAVE ALL IN ORDER BUT AS THAT COULD NOT BE SHE SAT DOWN AGAIN AND TRIED OVER ALL THE SONGS SHE KNEW
lbi-4831-25894-0008 WHEN SHE HAD TOLD HER PLAN PETER BENARI SHOOK HIS HEAD AND THOUGHT IT WOULD NEVER DO BUT TESSA BEGGED SO HARD HE CONSENTED AT LAST THAT SHE SHOULD TRY IT FOR ONE WEEK AND SENT HER TO BED THE HAPPIEST LITTLE GIRL IN NEW YORK

lbi-4831-25894-0010 POOR TESSA'S HEART BEAT FAST AS SHE TRUDGED AWAY WITH TOMMO WHO SLUNG HIS HARP OVER HIS SHOULDER AND GAVE HER HIS HAND
lbi-4831-25894-0011 IT WAS RATHER A DIRTY HAND BUT SO KIND THAT TESSA CLUNG TO IT AND KEPT LOOKING UP AT THE FRIENDLY BROWN FACE FOR ENCOURAGEMENT
lbi-4831-25894-0012 SEE NOW HAVE NO FEAR GIVE THEM BELLA MONICA THAT IS MERRY AND WILL MAKE THE LAUGH WHISPERED TOMMO TUNING HIS HARP

lbi-4831-25894-0014 BUT TOMMO SHOOK HIS CURLY HEAD AND ANSWERED SOBERLY YES I TOOK YOU THERE FIRST FOR THEY LOVE MUSIC AND ARE OF OUR COUNTRY BUT UP AMONG THE GREAT HOUSES WE SHALL NOT ALWAYS DO WELL
lbi-4831-25894-0015 BUT SHE HAD MADE HALF A DOLLAR FOR TOMMO DIVIDED THE MONEY FAIRLY AND SHE FELT RICH WITH HER SHARE
lbi-4831-25894-0016 HER HANDS WERE COVERED WITH CHILBLAINS FOR SHE HAD NO MITTENS BUT SHE PUT THEM UNDER HER SHAWL AND SCUFFLED MERRILY AWAY IN HER BIG BOOTS FEELING SO GLAD THAT THE WEEK WAS OVER AND NEARLY THREE DOLLARS SAFE IN HER POCKET
lbi-4831-25894-0017 HOW GAY THE STREETS WERE THAT DAY
lbi-4831-25894-0018 HOW BRISK EVERY ONE WAS AND HOW BRIGHT THE FACES LOOKED AS PEOPLE TROTTED ABOUT WITH BIG BASKETS HOLLY WREATHS AND YOUNG EVERGREENS GOING TO BLOSSOM INTO SPLENDID CHRISTMAS TREES
lbi-4831-25894-0019 BUT I CAN'T SO I'LL FILL THE SOCKS ALL FULL AND BE HAPPY SAID TESSA AS SHE LOOKED WISTFULLY INTO THE GAY STORES AND SAW THE HEAVY BASKETS GO BY
lbi-4831-25894-0020 WHO KNOWS WHAT MAY HAPPEN IF WE DO WELL RETURNED TOMMO NODDING WISELY FOR HE HAD A PLAN AS WELL AS TESSA AND KEPT CHUCKLING OVER IT AS HE TRUDGED THROUGH THE MUD
lbi-4831-25894-0021 WE'LL TRY ONE MORE STREET AND THEN GO HOME THOU ART SO TIRED LITTLE ONE
lbi-4831-25894-0022 AT THE FOURTH SOME PEOPLE LET THEM SING ALL THEIR SONGS AND GAVE NOTHING
lbi-4831-25894-0023 TESSA FELT SO GRATEFUL THAT WITHOUT WAITING FOR TOMMO SHE SANG HER SWEETEST LITTLE SONG ALL ALONE
lbi-4831-25894-0024 I'LL ASK MAMMA SAID ROSE AND AWAY SHE WENT INTO THE DINING ROOM CLOSE BY
lbi-4831-25894-0025 AS THE DOOR OPENED TESSA SAW WHAT LOOKED TO HER LIKE A FAIRY FEAST ALL SILVER MUGS AND FLOWERY PLATES AND ORANGES AND NUTS AND ROSY WINE IN TALL GLASS PITCHERS AND SMOKING DISHES THAT SMELT SO DELICIOUSLY SHE COULD NOT RESTRAIN A LITTLE SNIFF OF SATISFACTION
lbi-4831-25894-0026 AH YES I SHALL COME WITH MUCH GLADNESS AND PLAY AS NEVER IN MY LIFE BEFORE CRIED TOMMO WITH A FLOURISH OF THE OLD CAP THAT MADE THE CHILDREN LAUGH
lbi-4831-25894-0027 GIVE THESE TO YOUR BROTHERS SAID THE FAIRY PRINCE STUFFING NUTS AND ORANGES INTO TESSA'S HANDS
lbi-4831-25894-0028 AH SO KIND SO VERY KIND I HAVE NO WAY TO SAY THANK YOU BUT RANZA SHALL BE FOR YOU A HEAVENLY ANGEL AND I WILL SING MY HEART OUT FOR YOUR TREE CRIED TESSA FOLDING THE MITTENS AS IF SHE WOULD SAY A PRAYER OF THANKFULNESS IF SHE KNEW HOW
lbi-4831-25894-0029 SHE GOT UP EARLY TO SEE IF THE SOCKS WERE ALL RIGHT AND THERE SHE FOUND THE MOST ASTONISHING SIGHT
lbi-4831-25894-0030 FOUR SOCKS INSTEAD OF THREE AND BY THE FOURTH PINNED OUT QUITE ELEGANTLY WAS A LITTLE DRESS EVIDENTLY MEANT FOR HER A WARM WOOLLEN DRESS ALL MADE AND ACTUALLY WITH BRIGHT BUTTONS ON IT
lbi-4831-25894-0031 TESSA SCREAMED AND DANCED IN HER DELIGHT AND UP TUMBLED ALL THE CHILDREN TO SCREAM AND DANCE WITH HER MAKING A REGULAR CARNIVAL ON A SMALL SCALE
lbi-4831-25894-0032 IN HER LONG STOCKING SHE FOUND ALL SORTS OF TREASURES FOR TOMMO HAD STUFFED IT FULL OF QUEER THINGS AND HIS MOTHER HAD MADE GINGERBREAD INTO EVERY IMAGINABLE SHAPE FROM FAT PIGS TO FULL OMNIBUSES
lbi-4831-25894-0033 LITTLE RANZA WAS ACCEPTED WITH DELIGHT BY THE KIND LADY AND HER CHILDREN AND TESSA LEARNED THE SONG QUITE EASILY
lbi-4831-25894-0034 AROSE FROM THE CROWD OF CHILDREN GATHERED TO THE FESTIVAL
lbi-4831-25894-0035 BEFORE THEY WENT HOME THE KIND MAMMA TOLD TESSA SHE SHOULD BE HER FRIEND AND GAVE HER A MOTHERLY KISS WHICH WARMED THE CHILD'S HEART AND SEEMED TO SET A SEAL UPON THAT PROMISE
lbi-4831-29134-0000 THE SENATOR TOOK HIS SEAT IN THE PULPIT WITH THE MINISTER ON ONE SIDE OF HIM AND THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE SUNDAY SCHOOL ON THE OTHER
lbi-4831-29134-0001 SO AWED WERE THEY BY THE PRESENCE OF A LIVING UNITED STATES SENATOR THAT DURING THREE MINUTES NOT A SPIT BALL WAS THROWN
lbi-4831-29134-0002 AFTER THAT THEY BEGAN TO COME TO THEMSELVES BY DEGREES AND PRESENTLY THE SPELL WAS WHOLLY GONE AND THEY WERE RECITING VERSES AND PULLING HAIR
lbi-4831-29134-0003 THE USUAL SUNDAY SCHOOL EXERCISES WERE HURRIED THROUGH AND THEN THE MINISTER GOT UP AND BORED THE HOUSE WITH A SPEECH BUILT ON THE CUSTOMARY SUNDAY SCHOOL PLAN THEN THE SUPERINTENDENT PUT IN HIS OAR THEN THE TOWN DIGNITARIES HAD THEIR SAY
lbi-4831-29134-0004 AM I IN SOME POPULOUS CENTRE OF MY OWN COUNTRY WHERE THE CHOICEST CHILDREN OF THE LAND HAVE BEEN SELECTED AND BROUGHT TOGETHER AS AT A FAIR FOR A PRIZE NO
lbi-4831-29134-0005 THEN WHERE AM I YES WHERE AM I
lbi-4831-29134-0006 MY SOUL IS LOST IN WONDER AT THE THOUGHT
lbi-4831-29134-0007 EARTH HAS NO HIGHER NO GRANDER POSITION FOR ME
lbi-4831-29134-0008 THEN WHAT IS IT WHAT DID MY CONSCIOUSNESS REPLY
lbi-4831-29134-0009 AH THINK OF THAT NOW I COULD HARDLY KEEP THE TEARS BACK I WAS SO GRATEFUL
lbi-4831-29134-0010 THEY COULD NOT GIVE HIM A COSTLY EDUCATION BUT THEY WERE GOOD AND WISE AND THEY SENT HIM TO THE SUNDAY SCHOOL HE LOVED THE SUNDAY SCHOOL
lbi-4831-29134-0011 I HOPE YOU LOVE YOUR SUNDAY SCHOOL AH I SEE BY YOUR FACES THAT YOU DO THAT IS RIGHT
lbi-4831-29134-0012 ALWAYS LOVE YOUR TEACHERS MY CHILDREN FOR THEY LOVE YOU MORE THAN YOU CAN KNOW NOW
lbi-4831-29134-0013 AND BY AND BY THE PEOPLE MADE HIM GOVERNOR AND HE SAID IT WAS ALL OWING TO THE SUNDAY SCHOOL
lbi-4831-29134-0014 WHY THE PEOPLE GAVE HIM A TOWERING ILLUSTRIOUS POSITION A GRAND IMPOSING POSITION
lbi-4831-29134-0015 IT WAS SENATOR OF THE UNITED STATES
lbi-4831-29134-0016 THAT POOR LITTLE BOY THAT LOVED HIS SUNDAY SCHOOL BECAME THAT MAN THAT MAN STANDS BEFORE YOU
lbi-4831-29134-0017 ABOVE ALL THINGS MY CHILDREN BE HONEST
lbi-4831-29134-0018 WHEN SENATOR DILWORTHY DEPARTED FROM CATTLEVILLE HE LEFT THREE DOZEN BOYS BEHIND HIM ARRANGING A CAMPAIGN OF LIFE WHOSE OBJECTIVE POINT WAS THE UNITED STATES SENATE
lbi-5543-27761-0000 LELECHKA WAS A DELIGHTFUL CHILD
lbi-5543-27761-0001 THERE WAS NO OTHER SUCH CHILD THERE NEVER HAD BEEN AND THERE NEVER WOULD BE
lbi-5543-27761-0002 LELECHKA'S MOTHER SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA WAS SURE OF THAT
lbi-5543-27761-0003 LELECHKA'S EYES WERE DARK AND LARGE HER CHEEKS WERE ROSY HER LIPS WERE MADE FOR KISSES AND FOR LAUGHTER
lbi-5543-27761-0004 BUT IT WAS NOT THESE CHARMS IN LELECHKA THAT GAVE HER MOTHER THE KEENEST JOY
lbi-5543-27761-0005 SHE FELT COLD WITH HER HUSBAND
lbi-5543-27761-0006 HE WAS ALWAYS FRESH AND COOL WITH A FRIGID SMILE AND WHEREVER HE PASSED COLD CURRENTS SEEMED TO MOVE IN THE AIR
lbi-5543-27761-0007 IT EVEN SEEMED TO SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA THAT SHE WAS IN LOVE WITH HER FUTURE HUSBAND AND THIS MADE HER HAPPY
lbi-5543-27761-0008 THE BRIDE WAS ALSO GOOD LOOKING SHE WAS A TALL DARK EYED DARK HAIRED GIRL SOMEWHAT TIMID BUT VERY TACTFUL
lbi-5543-27761-0009 HE HAD CONNEXIONS AND HIS WIFE CAME OF GOOD INFLUENTIAL PEOPLE
lbi-5543-27761-0010 THIS MIGHT AT THE PROPER OPPORTUNITY PROVE USEFUL
lbi-5543-27761-0011 AFTER THEIR MARRIAGE THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE MANNER OF SERGEY MODESTOVICH TO SUGGEST ANYTHING WRONG TO HIS WIFE
lbi-5543-27761-0012 LATER HOWEVER WHEN HIS WIFE WAS ABOUT TO HAVE A CHILD SERGEY MODESTOVICH ESTABLISHED CONNEXIONS ELSEWHERE OF A LIGHT AND TEMPORARY NATURE
lbi-5543-27761-0013 SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA FOUND THIS OUT AND TO HER OWN ASTONISHMENT WAS NOT PARTICULARLY HURT SHE AWAITED HER INFANT WITH A RESTLESS ANTICIPATION THAT SWALLOWED EVERY OTHER FEELING
lbi-5543-27761-0014 SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA DRIFTED FARTHER AND FARTHER AWAY FROM HIM
lbi-5543-27761-0015 LELECHKA THEN RAN AWAY STAMPING WITH HER PLUMP LITTLE LEGS OVER THE CARPETS AND HID HERSELF BEHIND THE CURTAINS NEAR HER BED
lbi-5543-27761-0016 WHERE IS MY BABY GIRL THE MOTHER ASKED AS SHE LOOKED FOR LELECHKA AND MADE BELIEVE THAT SHE DID NOT SEE HER
lbi-5543-27761-0017 THEN SHE CAME OUT A LITTLE FARTHER AND HER MOTHER AS THOUGH SHE HAD ONLY JUST CAUGHT SIGHT OF HER SEIZED HER BY HER LITTLE SHOULDERS AND EXCLAIMED JOYOUSLY HERE SHE IS MY LELECHKA
lbi-5543-27761-0018 HER MOTHER'S EYES GLOWED WITH PASSIONATE EMOTION
lbi-5543-27761-0019 HER MOTHER WENT TO HIDE
lbi-5543-27761-0020 LELECHKA TURNED AWAY AS THOUGH NOT TO SEE BUT WATCHED HER MAMOCHKA STEALTHILY ALL THE TIME
lbi-5543-27761-0021 WHERE'S MY MAMOCHKA ASKED LELECHKA
lbi-5543-27761-0022 A SMILE OF ABSOLUTE BLISS PLAYED ON HER RED LIPS
lbi-5543-27761-0023 LELECHKA WAS GETTING NEARER HER MOTHER'S CORNER
lbi-5543-27761-0024 HER MOTHER WAS GROWING MORE ABSORBED EVERY MOMENT BY HER INTEREST IN THE GAME HER HEART BEAT WITH SHORT QUICK STROKES AND SHE PRESSED EVEN CLOSER TO THE WALL DISARRANGING HER HAIR STILL MORE
lbi-5543-27761-0025 LELECHKA SUDDENLY GLANCED TOWARD HER MOTHER'S CORNER AND SCREAMED WITH JOY
lbi-5543-27761-0026 THROUGH THE HALF CLOSED DOORS HE HEARD THE LAUGHTER THE JOYOUS OUTCRIES THE SOUND OF ROMPING
lbi-5543-27761-0027 EVEN FEDOSYA FELT ABASHED NOW FOR HER MISTRESS NOW FOR HERSELF
lbi-5543-27761-0028 HE LIKED COMING HERE WHERE EVERYTHING WAS BEAUTIFULLY ARRANGED THIS WAS DONE BY SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA WHO WISHED TO SURROUND HER LITTLE GIRL FROM HER VERY INFANCY ONLY WITH THE LOVELIEST THINGS
lbi-5543-27761-0029 SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA DRESSED HERSELF TASTEFULLY THIS TOO SHE DID FOR LELECHKA WITH THE SAME END IN VIEW
lbi-5543-27761-0030 ONE THING SERGEY MODESTOVICH HAD NOT BECOME RECONCILED TO AND THIS WAS HIS WIFE'S ALMOST CONTINUOUS PRESENCE IN THE NURSERY
lbi-5543-27761-0031 IT'S JUST AS I THOUGHT I KNEW THAT I'D FIND YOU HERE HE SAID WITH A DERISIVE AND CONDESCENDING SMILE
lbi-5543-27761-0032 MERELY YOU SEE THAT THE CHILD SHOULD FEEL ITS OWN INDIVIDUALITY HE EXPLAINED IN ANSWER TO SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA'S PUZZLED GLANCE
lbi-5543-27761-0033 SHE'S STILL SO LITTLE SAID SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA
lbi-5543-27761-0034 I DON'T INSIST IT'S YOUR KINGDOM THERE
lbi-5543-27761-0035 I'LL THINK IT OVER HIS WIFE ANSWERED SMILING AS HE DID COLDLY BUT GENIALLY
lbi-5543-27761-0036 THEN THEY BEGAN TO TALK OF SOMETHING ELSE
lbi-5543-27761-0037 THAT THE MISTRESS DOES IT WELL THAT'S ONE THING BUT THAT THE YOUNG LADY DOES IT THAT'S BAD
lbi-5543-27761-0038 WHY ASKED FEDOSYA WITH CURIOSITY
lbi-5543-27761-0039 THIS EXPRESSION OF CURIOSITY GAVE HER FACE THE LOOK OF A WOODEN ROUGHLY PAINTED DOLL
lbi-5543-27761-0040 YES THAT'S BAD REPEATED AGATHYA WITH CONVICTION TERRIBLY BAD WELL
lbi-5543-27761-0041 IT'S THE TRUTH I'M SAYING REMEMBER MY WORDS AGATHYA WENT ON WITH THE SAME ASSURANCE AND SECRECY
lbi-5543-27761-0042 IT'S THE SUREST SIGN
lbi-5543-27761-0043 THE OLD WOMAN HAD INVENTED THIS SIGN QUITE SUDDENLY HERSELF AND SHE WAS EVIDENTLY VERY PROUD OF IT
lbi-5543-27761-0044 MADAM MADAM SHE SAID QUIETLY IN A TREMBLING VOICE
lbi-5543-27761-0045 SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA GAVE A START
lbi-5543-27761-0046 FEDOSYA'S FACE MADE HER ANXIOUS
lbi-5543-27761-0047 WHAT IS IT FEDOSYA SHE ASKED WITH GREAT CONCERN IS THERE ANYTHING WRONG WITH LELECHKA
lbi-5543-27761-0048 NO MADAM SAID FEDOSYA AS SHE GESTICULATED WITH HER HANDS TO REASSURE HER MISTRESS AND TO MAKE HER SIT DOWN
lbi-5543-27761-0049 LELECHKA IS ASLEEP MAY GOD BE WITH HER
lbi-5543-27761-0050 ONLY I'D LIKE TO SAY SOMETHING YOU SEE LELECHKA IS ALWAYS HIDING HERSELF THAT'S NOT GOOD
lbi-5543-27761-0051 I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW BAD IT IS SAID FEDOSYA AND HER FACE EXPRESSED THE MOST DECIDED CONFIDENCE
lbi-5543-27761-0052 I UNDERSTAND NOTHING OF WHAT YOU ARE SAYING
lbi-5543-27761-0053 YOU SEE MADAM IT'S A KIND OF OMEN EXPLAINED FEDOSYA ABRUPTLY IN A SHAMEFACED WAY
lbi-5543-27761-0054 NONSENSE SAID SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA
lbi-5543-27761-0055 WHO TOLD YOU ALL THIS ASKED SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA IN AN AUSTERE LOW VOICE
lbi-5543-27761-0056 KNOWS EXCLAIMED SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA IN IRRITATION AS THOUGH SHE WISHED TO PROTECT HERSELF SOMEHOW FROM THIS SUDDEN ANXIETY
lbi-5543-27761-0057 WHAT NONSENSE AS THOUGH LELECHKA COULD DIE
lbi-5543-27761-0058 SHE SAW CLEARLY THAT THERE COULD BE NO POSSIBLE CONNEXION BETWEEN A CHILD'S QUITE ORDINARY DIVERSION AND THE CONTINUATION OF THE CHILD'S LIFE
lbi-5543-27761-0059 SHE MADE A SPECIAL EFFORT THAT EVENING TO OCCUPY HER MIND WITH OTHER MATTERS BUT HER THOUGHTS RETURNED INVOLUNTARILY TO THE FACT THAT LELECHKA LOVED TO HIDE HERSELF
lbi-5543-27761-0060 WHEN LELECHKA WAS STILL QUITE SMALL AND HAD LEARNED TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN HER MOTHER AND HER NURSE SHE SOMETIMES SITTING IN HER NURSE'S ARMS MADE A SUDDEN ROGUISH GRIMACE AND HID HER LAUGHING FACE IN THE NURSE'S SHOULDER
lbi-5543-27761-0061 THEN SHE WOULD LOOK OUT WITH A SLY GLANCE
lbi-5543-27761-0062 THOUGH SHE REPROACHED HERSELF AT ONCE FOR THIS UNFOUNDED SUPERSTITIOUS DREAD NEVERTHELESS SHE COULD NOT ENTER WHOLEHEARTEDLY INTO THE SPIRIT OF LELECHKA'S FAVOURITE GAME AND SHE TRIED TO DIVERT LELECHKA'S ATTENTION TO SOMETHING ELSE
lbi-5543-27761-0063 SHE EAGERLY COMPLIED WITH HER MOTHER'S NEW WISHES
lbi-5543-27761-0064 SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA TRIED DESPERATELY TO AMUSE LELECHKA
lbi-5543-27761-0065 PERHAPS THOUGHT SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA SHE IS NOT AS STRONGLY DRAWN TO THE WORLD AS OTHER CHILDREN WHO ARE ATTRACTED BY MANY THINGS
lbi-5543-27761-0066 IF THIS IS SO IS IT NOT A SIGN OF ORGANIC WEAKNESS
lbi-5543-27761-0067 SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA HERSELF BEGAN THE GAME ONCE OR TWICE THOUGH SHE PLAYED IT WITH A HEAVY HEART
lbi-5543-27761-0068 SHE SUFFERED AS THOUGH COMMITTING AN EVIL DEED WITH FULL CONSCIOUSNESS
lbi-5543-27761-0069 IT WAS A SAD DAY FOR SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA
lbi-5543-27761-0070 HER MOTHER COVERED HER WITH A BLUE BLANKET
lbi-5543-27761-0071 LELECHKA DREW HER SWEET LITTLE HANDS FROM UNDER THE BLANKET AND STRETCHED THEM OUT TO EMBRACE HER MOTHER HER MOTHER BENT DOWN
lbi-5543-27761-0072 SHE SEEMED SO SMALL AND SO FRAIL UNDER THE BLANKET THAT COVERED HER
lbi-5543-27761-0073 SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA REMAINED STANDING OVER LELECHKA'S BED A LONG WHILE AND SHE KEPT LOOKING AT LELECHKA WITH TENDERNESS AND FEAR
lbi-5543-27761-0074 I'M A MOTHER IS IT POSSIBLE THAT I SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO PROTECT HER SHE THOUGHT AS SHE IMAGINED THE VARIOUS ILLS THAT MIGHT BEFALL LELECHKA
lbi-5543-27761-0075 SHE PRAYED LONG THAT NIGHT BUT THE PRAYER DID NOT RELIEVE HER SADNESS
lbi-5543-27761-0076 SEVERAL DAYS PASSED LELECHKA CAUGHT COLD
lbi-5543-27761-0077 THE FEVER CAME UPON HER AT NIGHT
lbi-5543-27761-0078 WHEN SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA AWAKENED BY FEDOSYA CAME TO LELECHKA AND SAW HER LOOKING SO HOT SO RESTLESS AND SO TORMENTED SHE INSTANTLY RECALLED THE EVIL OMEN AND A HOPELESS DESPAIR TOOK POSSESSION OF HER FROM THE FIRST MOMENTS
lbi-5543-27761-0079 A DOCTOR WAS CALLED AND EVERYTHING WAS DONE THAT IS USUAL ON SUCH OCCASIONS BUT THE INEVITABLE HAPPENED
lbi-5543-27761-0080 AND LELECHKA GREW FEEBLER FROM HOUR TO HOUR
lbi-5543-27761-0081 NOTHING MADE HER SO UNHAPPY AS THE REITERATIONS OF FEDOSYA UTTERED BETWEEN SOBS SHE HID HERSELF AND HID HERSELF OUR LELECHKA
lbi-5543-27761-0082 FEVER WAS CONSUMING LELECHKA AND THERE WERE TIMES WHEN SHE LOST CONSCIOUSNESS AND SPOKE IN DELIRIUM
lbi-5543-27761-0083 THREE DAYS PASSED TORTURING LIKE A NIGHTMARE
lbi-5543-27761-0084 SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA HID HER FACE BEHIND THE CURTAINS NEAR LELECHKA'S BED HOW TRAGIC
lbi-5543-27761-0085 A WHITE MAMOCHKA WHISPERED LELECHKA
lbi-5543-27761-0086 MAMOCHKA'S WHITE FACE BECAME BLURRED AND EVERYTHING GREW DARK BEFORE LELECHKA
lbi-5543-27761-0087 SHE MET HER HUSBAND
lbi-5543-27761-0088 SERAFIMA AICKSANDROVNA WAS STANDING BY THE COFFIN AND LOOKING DULLY AT HER DEAD CHILD
lbi-5543-27761-0089 SIMA MY DEAR DON'T AGITATE YOURSELF SAID SERGEY MODESTOVICH IN A WHISPER
lbi-5543-27761-0090 YOU MUST RESIGN YOURSELF TO YOUR FATE
lbi-5543-27761-0091 SHE'LL BE UP IN A MINUTE PERSISTED SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA HER EYES FIXED ON THE DEAD LITTLE GIRL
lbi-5543-27761-0092 SERGEY MODESTOVICH LOOKED ROUND HIM CAUTIOUSLY HE WAS AFRAID OF THE UNSEEMLY AND OF THE RIDICULOUS
lbi-5543-27761-0093 SIMA DON'T AGITATE YOURSELF HE REPEATED
lbi-5543-27761-0094 HE WAS CONFUSED AND ANNOYED
lbi-5543-27761-0095 HER FACE SEEMED TRANQUIL AND HER EYES WERE DRY
lbi-5543-27761-0096 SHE WENT INTO THE NURSERY AND BEGAN TO WALK ROUND THE ROOM LOOKING INTO THOSE PLACES WHERE LELECHKA USED TO HIDE HERSELF
lbi-5543-27761-0097 SHE WALKED ALL ABOUT THE ROOM AND BENT NOW AND THEN TO LOOK UNDER THE TABLE OR UNDER THE BED AND KEPT ON REPEATING CHEERFULLY WHERE IS MY LITTLE ONE WHERE IS MY LELECHKA
lbi-5543-27761-0098 AFTER SHE HAD WALKED ROUND THE ROOM ONCE SHE BEGAN TO MAKE HER QUEST ANEW
lbi-5543-27761-0099 FEDOSYA MOTIONLESS WITH DEJECTED FACE SAT IN A CORNER AND LOOKED FRIGHTENED AT HER MISTRESS THEN SHE SUDDENLY BURST OUT SOBBING AND SHE WAILED LOUDLY
lbi-5543-27761-0100 SHE HID HERSELF AND HID HERSELF OUR LELECHKA OUR ANGELIC LITTLE SOUL
lbi-5543-27761-0101 WHEN SHE ENTERED THE PARLOUR THERE WERE SEVERAL PEOPLE BETWEEN HER AND LELECHKA
lbi-5543-27761-0102 THERE WAS AN OPPRESSIVE FEELING OF HEAVINESS IN SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA'S HEAD AS SHE APPROACHED LELECHKA
lbi-5543-27761-0103 LELECHKA LAY THERE STILL AND PALE AND SMILED PATHETICALLY
lbi-5543-27761-0104 THE LITTLE ONE DID NOT REPLY
lbi-5543-27761-0105 SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA STOOD UP ERECT SIGHED IN A LOST WAY SMILED AND CALLED LOUDLY LELECHKA
lbi-5543-27761-0106 LELECHKA WAS BEING CARRIED OUT
lbi-5849-50873-0000 CAPTAIN BULL THE COMMANDER OF A SMALL GARRISON AT SAYBROOK PERMITTED HIM TO LAND BUT WHEN THE GOVERNOR BEGAN TO READ HIS COMMISSION BULL ORDERED HIM TO BE SILENT
lbi-5849-50873-0001 WHAT HAS HAPPENED MISTER PRINCE WADSWORTH ASKED FOR HE COULD SEE THAT THE MAN WAS GREATLY EXCITED GOVERNOR ANDROS HAS COME AGAIN GASPED MISTER PRINCE WHY SHOULD THAT ALARM US THE FELLOW THOUGH GIVEN TO BOASTING IS NOT DANGEROUS OR LIABLE TO PUT HIS THREATS INTO EXECUTION BUT HE HAS GROWN DANGEROUS DECLARED MISTER PRINCE THE LIBERTIES OF THE COLONY ARE INVOLVED
lbi-5849-50873-0002 CAPTAIN WADSWORTH BECAME A LITTLE UNEASY THOUGH HE WAS STILL INCLINED TO TREAT THE MATTER LIGHTLY
lbi-5849-50873-0003 WE HAVE STUBBORNLY REFUSED TO YIELD OUR CHARTER VOLUNTARILY FOR IT IS THE GUARDIAN OF OUR POLITICAL RIGHTS
lbi-5849-50873-0004 THAT IS TRUE CAPTAIN WADSWORTH CONTINUED MISTER PRINCE AND TO SUBDUE OUR STUBBORNNESS THIS VICEROY HAS COME TO HARTFORD WITH SIXTY ARMED MEN TO DEMAND THE SURRENDER OF THE CHARTER IN PERSON
lbi-5849-50873-0005 CAPTAIN WADSWORTH BOUNDED TO HIS FEET IN A RAGE AND PLACING HIS HAND ON THE HILT OF HIS SWORD DECLARED HE SHALL NOT HAVE IT
lbi-5849-50873-0006 THE DAY WAS WELL NIGH SPENT WHEN HE ARRIVED AND THE MEMBERS WERE ENGAGED IN A HEATED DEBATE ON A SUBJECT OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE
lbi-5849-50873-0007 HE CONSENTED HOWEVER TO AWAIT THE DISCUSSION BUT AS SOON AS IT WAS ENDED HE DECLARED THAT HE WOULD HAVE THE CHARTER
lbi-5849-50873-0008 AFTER THE CAPTAIN HAD TAKEN TWO OR THREE TURNS ACROSS THE ROOM HE PAUSED AND ASKED
lbi-5849-50873-0009 WHAT IS THE ASSEMBLY DOING ENGAGED IN A DEBATE
lbi-5849-50873-0010 AND WILL HE WAIT UNTIL IT HAS ENDED HE HAS PROMISED TO DO SO
lbi-5849-50873-0011 MISTER PRINCE FIXED HIS AMAZED EYES ON THE CAPTAIN'S FACE AND READ THERE A DESPERATE DETERMINATION CAPTAIN HE BEGAN
lbi-5849-50873-0012 MISTER PRINCE BOWED AND HASTILY RETURNED TO THE HOUSE WHERE THE ASSEMBLY WAS IN SESSION
lbi-5849-50873-0013 AS SOON AS HE WAS GONE CHARLES STEVENS SAID
lbi-5849-50873-0014 YES CHARLES YOU WILL ANSWER WHAT DO YOU MEAN UNCLE
lbi-5849-50873-0015 NEVER DID DEBATERS TAKE GREATER INTEREST IN A MINOR SUBJECT
lbi-5849-50873-0016 WHAT DO YOU INTEND DOING UNCLE WILL YOU FIGHT THEM
lbi-5849-50873-0017 REMEMBER THE WORK MUST BE DONE RIGHT AT THE TIME NOT TOO SOON NOR TOO LATE
lbi-5849-50873-0018 THE SUN WAS SETTING AND THE CAPTAIN SAID
lbi-5849-50873-0019 COME CHARLES LET US HASTEN TO THE ASSEMBLY
lbi-5849-50873-0020 BY NO MEANS BUT I WANT YOU TO BE FULLY IMPRESSED WITH THE SERIOUSNESS OF YOUR MISSION
lbi-5849-50873-0021 TAKE YOUR PLACE CHARLES AND BE PREPARED TO DO YOUR PART WHISPERED CAPTAIN WADSWORTH
lbi-5849-50873-0022 CHARLES GOT AS CLOSE TO THE LONG TABLE USED BY THE SECRETARIES AS POSSIBLE WITHOUT ATTRACTING SPECIAL ATTENTION
lbi-5849-50873-0023 THE DISCUSSION WENT ON DARKNESS CAME AND FOUR LIGHTED CANDLES WERE PLACED ON THE TABLE AND TWO SET ON A SHELF ON THE WALL
lbi-5849-50873-0024 THOSE TWO CANDLES ON THE WALL WERE A GREAT ANNOYANCE TO CHARLES UNTIL HE SAW A MAN STATIONED NEAR THEM
lbi-5849-50873-0025 THOUGH THE LIGHTS WERE EXTINGUISHED THROUGH THE WINDOWS THE FAINT STARLIGHT DIMLY ILLUMINATED THE SCENE
lbi-5849-50873-0026 HE FOLLOWED HIM AS RAPIDLY AS HE COULD
lbi-5849-50873-0027 THE YOUTH WAS CLOSE BEHIND HIM AND WHEN THEY WERE OUTSIDE SEIZED HIS ARM
lbi-5849-50873-0028 BOY HAVE A CARE HOW YOU APPROACH ME
lbi-5849-50873-0029 THE SOLDIERS BEGAN TO CROWD ABOUT THE HOUSE WHEN AT A SIGNAL FROM CAPTAIN WADSWORTH THE TRAIN BANDS CAME ON THE SCENE AND PREPARED TO GRAPPLE WITH THE SOLDIERS
lbi-5849-50873-0030 WHERE IS THE CHARTER
lbi-5849-50873-0031 YOU HAVE YOUR SOLDIERS AT THE DOOR AND WE HAVE THE TRAIN BANDS OF CONNECTICUT READY TO DEFEND US AGAINST VIOLENCE
lbi-5849-50873-0032 WHO OF YOU HAS THE CHARTER
lbi-5849-50873-0033 IT WAS THE BOY CRIED THE ENRAGED GOVERNOR
lbi-5849-50873-0034 EVERY MEMBER OF THE ASSEMBLY SHOOK THEIR HEADS
lbi-5849-50873-0035 WE DO NOT KNOW HIM HE DOES NOT LIVE IN CONNECTICUT WHERE DOES HE LIVE
lbi-5849-50873-0036 LITTLE DID THE CAPTAIN OR HIS YOUTHFUL ASSISTANT DREAM THAT THEIR SIMPLE ACT WOULD MAKE THE OLD TREE HISTORIC
lbi-5849-50873-0037 THE TREE IN WHICH THE DOCUMENT WAS HIDDEN WAS EVER AFTERWARD KNOWN AS THE CHARTER OAK
lbi-5849-50873-0038 IT REMAINED VIGOROUS BEARING FRUIT EVERY YEAR UNTIL A LITTLE AFTER MIDNIGHT AUGUST EIGHTEEN FIFTY SIX WHEN IT WAS PROSTRATED BY A HEAVY STORM OF WIND
lbi-5849-50873-0039 WHEN THE ORDER FOR THE SEIZURE OF THE CHARTERS WAS FIRST MADE KNOWN THE ASSEMBLY OF RHODE ISLAND SENT A MOST LOYAL ADDRESS TO THE KING SAYING
lbi-5849-50873-0040 HE FORMALLY DISSOLVED THE ASSEMBLY BROKE THE SEAL OF THE COLONY WHICH BORE THE FIGURE OF AN ANCHOR AND THE WORD HOPE ADMITTED FIVE OF THE INHABITANTS INTO HIS LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL AND ASSUMED THE FUNCTIONS OF GOVERNOR BUT HE DID NOT TAKE AWAY THE PARCHMENT ON WHICH THE CHARTER WAS WRITTEN
lbi-5849-50873-0041 FROM THAT TIME UNTIL THE ENFORCED UNION OF THE COLONIES FOR MUTUAL DEFENCE AT THE BREAKING OUT OF THE FRENCH AND INDIAN WAR THE INHABITANTS OF RHODE ISLAND BORE THEIR SHARE IN THE DEFENSIVE EFFORTS ESPECIALLY WHEN THE HOSTILE SAVAGES HUNG ALONG THE FRONTIERS OF NEW YORK LIKE AN ILL OMENED CLOUD
lbi-5849-50873-0042 THE HISTORY OF THAT COMMONWEALTH IS IDENTIFIED WITH THAT OF ALL NEW ENGLAND FROM THE BEGINNING OF KING WILLIAM'S WAR SOON AFTER TO THE EXPULSION OF ANDROS
lbi-5849-50962-0000 CALLED BERT WHO HAD HEARD HIS UNCLE GETTING READY TO RUN DOWN TO THE WATER'S EDGE
lbi-5849-50962-0001 IT'S A SCHOONER SAID MISTER BINGHAM TO MISTER MINTURN AND SHE HAS A VERY HEAVY CARGO
lbi-5849-50962-0002 TO THIS CORD WAS FASTENED A HEAVY ROPE OR CABLE
lbi-5849-50962-0003 WHAT'S THAT BOARD FOR ASKED BERT AS HE SAW A BOARD FOLLOWING THE CABLE
lbi-5849-50962-0004 THAT'S THE DIRECTIONS SAID HAL
lbi-5849-50962-0005 THEY ARE PRINTED IN A NUMBER OF LANGUAGES AND THEY TELL THE CREW TO CARRY THE END OF THE CABLE HIGH UP THE MAST AND FASTEN IT STRONGLY THERE
lbi-5849-50962-0006 OH I SEE SAID BERT THE LINE WILL STRETCH THEN AND THE BREECHES BUOY WILL GO OUT ON A PULLEY
lbi-5849-50962-0007 IT WAS CLEAR DAY NOW AND MUCH OF THE WICKED STORM HAD PASSED
lbi-5849-50962-0008 WITH THE DAYLIGHT CAME GIRLS AND WOMEN TO THE BEACH
lbi-5849-50962-0009 MISSUS BOBBSEY MISSUS MINTURN NELLIE AND HER MOTHER BESIDES DOROTHY AND NAN WERE ALL THERE FLOSSIE AND FREDDIE BEING OBLIGED TO STAY HOME WITH DINAH AND SUSAN
lbi-5849-50962-0010 OF COURSE THE GIRLS ASKED ALL SORTS OF QUESTIONS AND BERT AND HAL TRIED TO ANSWER THEM AS BEST THEY COULD
lbi-5849-50962-0011 IT SEEMED A LONG TIME BEFORE ANY MOVEMENT OF THE CABLE SHOWED THAT THE BUOY WAS RETURNING
lbi-5849-50962-0012 NEARER AND NEARER IT CAME UNTIL NOW A MAN'S HEAD COULD BE SEEN
lbi-5849-50962-0013 THE GIRLS AND WOMEN WERE TOO FRIGHTENED TO TALK AND NELLIE CLUNG CLOSE TO HER MOTHER
lbi-5849-50962-0014 A BIG ROLLER DASHING IN FINISHED THE WORK FOR THE LIFE GUARDS AND A MAN IN THE CORK BELT BOUNDED UPON SHORE
lbi-5849-50962-0015 EVERYBODY GATHERED AROUND AND NELLIE WITH A STRANGE FACE AND A STRANGER HOPE BROKE THROUGH THE CROWD TO SEE THE RESCUED MAN
lbi-5849-50962-0016 OH IT IS MY FATHER SHE SCREAMED FALLING RIGHT INTO THE ARMS OF THE DRENCHED MAN
lbi-5849-50962-0017 BUT THE HALF DROWNED MAN RUBBED HIS EYES AS IF HE COULD NOT BELIEVE THEM THEN THE NEXT MINUTE HE PRESSED HIS LITTLE DAUGHTER TO HIS HEART UNABLE TO SPEAK A WORD
lbi-5849-50962-0018 AND IS GEORGE BINGHAM OUT THERE ANXIOUSLY ASKED THE BROTHER
lbi-5849-50962-0019 SAFE AND WELL CAME THE WELCOME ANSWER
lbi-5849-50962-0020 I GUESS OUR PRAYERS WERE HEARD LAST NIGHT
lbi-5849-50962-0021 HERE COMES ANOTHER MAN EXCLAIMED THE PEOPLE AS THIS TIME A BIG MAN DASHED ON THE SANDS
lbi-5849-50962-0022 WELL I DECLARE WE DID LAND ON A FRIENDLY SHORE
lbi-5849-50962-0023 JUST AS MISTER BINGHAM SAID THE LIFE SAVING WORK TURNED OUT TO BE A SOCIAL AFFAIR FOR THERE WAS A GREAT TIME GREETING NELLIE'S FATHER AND HAL'S UNCLE
lbi-5849-50962-0024 AND HAL AND HIS FATHER TOO PUT IN NAN
lbi-5849-50962-0025 WHAT A MORNING THAT WAS AT SUNSET BEACH
lbi-5849-50962-0026 I'M SO GLAD WE PRAYED SAID LITTLE FLOSSIE TO FREDDIE WHEN SHE HEARD THE GOOD NEWS
lbi-5849-50963-0000 A BEAUTIFUL DAY HAD GROWN OUT OF THE DREADFUL STORM
lbi-5849-50963-0001 AND EVERYBODY WAS SO HAPPY
lbi-5849-50963-0002 THE NEPTUNE THE VESSEL THAT HAD STRUCK ON THE SAND BAR WAS NOW SAFELY ANCHORED NEAR SHORE AND THE SAILORS CAME IN AND OUT IN ROW BOATS BACK AND FORTH TO LAND JUST AS THEY WISHED
lbi-5849-50963-0003 THEN WE HAD TO GO BACK TO WORK AT THE LOGS WENT ON THE CAPTAIN AND THEN ONE OF OUR CREW TOOK A FEVER
lbi-5849-50963-0004 THAT WAS WHAT DELAYED US SO
lbi-5849-50963-0005 FINALLY WE HAD EVERY LOG LOADED ON THE SCHOONER AND WE STARTED OFF
lbi-5849-50963-0006 WE COUNTED ON GETTING HOME LAST WEEK WHEN THIS LAST STORM STRUCK US AND DROVE US OUT OF OUR COURSE
lbi-5849-50963-0007 ABOUT THE VALUE ASKED MISTER BOBBSEY WHO WAS DOWN FROM THE CITY
lbi-5849-50963-0008 THE VALUE REPEATED THE CAPTAIN ASIDE SO THAT THE STRANGERS MIGHT NOT HEAR
lbi-5849-50963-0009 WELL I'M A RICH MAN NOW AND SO IS MY MATE MC LAUGHLIN FOR THAT WOOD WAS CONTRACTED FOR BY THE LARGEST AND RICHEST PIANO FIRM IN THIS COUNTRY AND NOW IT IS ALL BUT DELIVERED TO THEM AND THE MONEY IN OUR HANDS
lbi-5849-50963-0010 YES INDEED IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN US A LIFETIME TO ACCUMULATE AS MUCH MONEY AS WE HAVE EARNED IN THIS YEAR
lbi-5849-50963-0011 MAYBE AUNT EMILY WILL TAKE YOU DOWN TO THE CITY ON HER SHOPPING TOUR SUGGESTED NAN
lbi-5849-50963-0012 HE MADE THE CLERKS REMOVE ALL THE TRUCK FROM THE AISLES AND I GUESS EVERYBODY WAS GLAD THE ARMY FELL DOWN
lbi-5849-50963-0013 THE WONDERFUL FRESH AIR THAT THESE MEN LIVED IN NIGHT AND DAY HAD BRIGHTENED THEIR EYES TOO SO THAT EVEN THE PLAINEST FACE AND THE MOST AWKWARD MAN AMONG THEM WAS AS NIMBLE AS AN ATHLETE FROM HIS PERFECT EXERCISE
lbi-5849-50964-0000 I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SAY GOOD BY TO YOU NELLIE TOLD DOROTHY AND NAN NEXT MORNING
lbi-5849-50964-0001 OH THAT WILL BE SPLENDID DECLARED NAN
lbi-5849-50964-0002 YOU ARE QUITE RICH NOW AREN'T YOU REMARKED DOROTHY
lbi-5849-50964-0003 AND DOROTHY WENT UP AND DOWN THE ROOM LIKE THE PICTURES OF CINDERELLA'S PROUD SISTERS
lbi-5849-50964-0004 AND WE WILL BE ON HAND THANK YOU REPLIED THE JOKING DOROTHY
lbi-5849-50964-0005 COME NELLIE CALLED MISSUS MC LAUGHLIN I AM READY WHERE IS YOUR HAT
lbi-5849-50964-0006 WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO MANAGE THAT TOO NELLIE TOLD HIM
lbi-5849-50964-0007 MY UNCLE IS A FIREMAN AND HE CAN TAKE US THROUGH HIS ENGINE HOUSE
lbi-5849-50964-0008 MOST OF THEM I GUESS ANSWERED BERT
lbi-5849-50964-0009 WELL WE HAVE HAD A GOOD VACATION AND I AM WILLING TO GO TO WORK AGAIN
lbi-5849-50964-0010 SO AM I DECLARED NAN VACATION WAS JUST LONG ENOUGH I THINK
lbi-5849-50964-0011 MISTER BOBBSEY WAS DOWN FROM THE CITY OF COURSE TO TAKE THE FAMILY HOME AND NOW ALL HANDS EVEN FREDDIE AND FLOSSIE WERE BUSY PACKING UP
lbi-5849-50964-0012 THERE WERE THE SHELLS TO BE LOOKED AFTER THE FISH NETS BESIDES DOWNY THE DUCK AND SNOOP THE CAT
lbi-5849-50964-0013 AND SO OUR LITTLE FRIENDS HAD SPENT ALL THEIR VACATION
lbi-6123-59150-0000 HIS CHARACTERS GET DRUNK OR GO MAD WITH JEALOUSY OR FALL IN EPILEPTIC FITS OR RAVE HYSTERICALLY
lbi-6123-59150-0001 IF DOSTOEVSKY HAD HAD LESS VISION HE WOULD HAVE BEEN STRINDBERG
lbi-6123-59150-0002 LIKE THEM HE IS A NOVELIST OF TORTURE
lbi-6123-59150-0003 CERTAINLY THE LUST OF CRUELTY THE LUST OF DESTRUCTION FOR DESTRUCTION'S SAKE IS THE MOST CONSPICUOUS OF THE DEADLY SINS IN DOSTOEVSKY'S MEN AND WOMEN
lbi-6123-59150-0004 HE MAY NOT BE A CRUEL AUTHOR
lbi-6123-59150-0005 BUT THEY ARE NEVER IN BALANCE THEY ARE ALWAYS IN DEMONIACAL CONFLICT
lbi-6123-59150-0006 EVEN THE LUST IS NEVER OR HARDLY EVER THE LUST OF A MORE OR LESS SANE MAN
lbi-6123-59150-0007 DOSTOEVSKY COULD NOT HAVE DESCRIBED THE SIN OF NEKHLUDOV IN RESURRECTION
lbi-6123-59150-0008 THIS IS A MADHOUSE CRIES SOME ONE IN THE IDIOT
lbi-6123-59150-0009 ONE RESULT OF THIS IS A MULTIPLICITY OF ACTION
lbi-6123-59150-0010 EVEN THE TALK IS OF ACTIONS MORE THAN OF IDEAS
lbi-6123-59150-0011 HE SOWS VIOLENT DEEDS NOT WITH THE HAND BUT WITH THE SACK
lbi-6123-59150-0012 BUT ONE HAD NOTICED DURING THOSE LAST TWO DAYS THAT THE OTHER WAS WEARING A SILVER WATCH ON A YELLOW BEAD CHAIN WHICH HE SEEMS NOT TO HAVE SEEN ON HIM BEFORE
lbi-6123-59150-0013 HE TOOK A KNIFE AND WHEN HIS FRIEND HAD TURNED AWAY HE APPROACHED HIM CAUTIOUSLY FROM BEHIND TOOK AIM TURNED HIS EYES HEAVENWARDS CROSSED HIMSELF AND PRAYING FERVENTLY GOD FORGIVE ME FOR CHRIST'S SAKE
lbi-6123-59150-0014 HE NEVER PAINTS EVERYMAN HE ALWAYS PROJECTS DOSTOEVSKY OR A NIGHTMARE OF DOSTOEVSKY
lbi-6123-59150-0015 THAT IS WHY CRIME AND PUNISHMENT BELONGS TO A LOWER RANGE OF FICTION THAN ANNA KARENINA OR FATHERS AND SONS
lbi-6123-59150-0016 WE SYMPATHIZE INDEED WITH THE FEARS THE BRAVADO THE DESPAIR THAT SUCCEED THE CRIME
lbi-6123-59150-0017 HE IS A GROTESQUE MADE ALIVE BY SHEER IMAGINATIVE INTENSITY AND PASSION
lbi-6123-59150-0018 ONE DOES NOT GRUDGE AN ARTIST AN ABNORMAL CHARACTER OR TWO
lbi-6123-59150-0019 HE INVENTS VICIOUS GROTESQUES AS DICKENS INVENTS COMIC GROTESQUES
lbi-6123-59150-0020 WAS VERY FOND OF HANGING CATS AND BURYING THEM WITH GREAT CEREMONY
lbi-6123-59150-0021 AS FOR THE KARAMAZOVS THEMSELVES HE PORTRAYS THE OLD FATHER AND THE ELDEST OF HIS SONS HATING EACH OTHER AND FIGHTING LIKE BRUTAL MANIACS
lbi-6123-59150-0022 SERVE HIM RIGHT SHOUTED DMITRI BREATHLESSLY
lbi-6123-59150-0023 IF I HAVEN'T KILLED HIM I'LL COME AGAIN AND KILL HIM
lbi-6123-59150-0024 IT IS EASY TO SEE WHY DOSTOEVSKY HAS BECOME A POPULAR AUTHOR
lbi-6123-59150-0025 NO MELODRAMATIST EVER POURED OUT INCIDENT UPON THE STAGE FROM SUCH A HORN OF PLENTY
lbi-6123-59150-0026 DOSTOEVSKY IS ALWAYS READY TO SHOW THEM ALL IN AT ONCE
lbi-6123-59150-0027 ON TWO OPPOSITE PAGES OF THE IDIOT ONE FINDS THE FOLLOWING CHARACTERS BROUGHT IN BY NAME GENERAL EPANCHIN PRINCE S ADELAIDA IVANOVNA LIZAVETA PROKOFYEVNA YEVGENY PAVLOVITCH RADOMSKY PRINCESS BYELOKONSKY AGLAIA PRINCE MYSHKIN KOLYA IVOLGIN IPPOLIT VARYA FERDYSHCHENKO NASTASYA FILIPPOVNA NINA ALEXANDROVNA GANYA PTITSYN AND GENERAL IVOLGIN
lbi-6123-59150-0028 BUT THE SECRET OF DOSTOEVSKY'S APPEAL IS SOMETHING MORE THAN THE MULTITUDE AND THRILL OF HIS INCIDENTS AND CHARACTERS
lbi-6123-59150-0029 MISTER MURRY BOLDLY FACES THE DIFFICULTY AND ATTEMPTS THE DEFINITION
lbi-6123-59150-0030 TO HIM DOSTOEVSKY'S WORK IS THE RECORD OF A GREAT MIND SEEKING FOR A WAY OF LIFE IT IS MORE THAN A RECORD OF STRUGGLE IT IS THE STRUGGLE ITSELF
lbi-6123-59150-0031 AND THOSE VOICES TAKE SHAPE IN CERTAIN UNFORGETTABLE FRAGMENTS OF DIALOGUE THAT HAVE BEEN SPOKEN BY ONE SPIRIT TO ANOTHER IN SOME UGLY MEAN TAVERN SET IN SURROUNDING DARKNESS
lbi-6123-59150-0032 ULTIMATELY THEY ARE THE CREATIONS NOT OF A MAN WHO DESIRED TO BE BUT OF A SPIRIT WHICH SOUGHT TO KNOW
lbi-6123-59150-0033 BECAUSE THEY ARE POSSESSED THEY ARE NO LONGER MEN AND WOMEN
lbi-6123-59150-0034 THIS IS ALL IN A MEASURE TRUE
lbi-6123-59150-0035 TO SAY THIS IS NOT TO DENY THE SPIRITUAL CONTENT OF DOSTOEVSKY'S WORK THE ANGUISH OF THE IMPRISONED SOUL AS IT BATTLES WITH DOUBT AND DENIAL AND DESPAIR
lbi-6123-59150-0036 THERE IS IN DOSTOEVSKY A SUGGESTION OF CALIBAN TRYING TO DISCOVER SOME BETTER GOD THAN SETEBOS
lbi-6123-59150-0037 THE ULTIMATE ATTITUDE OF DOSTOEVSKY IS AS CHRISTIAN AS THE APOSTLE PETER'S LORD I BELIEVE HELP THOU MINE UNBELIEF
lbi-6123-59150-0038 AND BEYOND THE DARK NIGHT OF SUFFERING AND DISSIPATING THE NIGHT DOSTOEVSKY STILL SEES THE LIGHT OF CHRISTIAN COMPASSION
lbi-6123-59150-0039 OR EVEN BY THE COMPASSION OF OTHERS LIKE PRINCE MYSHKIN IN THE IDIOT
lbi-6123-59150-0040 HIS WORK LIKE HIS FACE BEARS THE MARK OF THIS TERRIBLE CONFLICT
lbi-6123-59150-0041 THE NOVELS ARE THE PERFECT IMAGE OF THE MAN
lbi-6123-59150-0042 AS TO THE MAN HIMSELF THE VICOMTE DE VOGUEE DESCRIBED HIM AS HE SAW HIM IN THE LAST YEARS OF HIS LIFE
lbi-6123-59150-0043 WHEN HE BECAME EXCITED ON A CERTAIN POINT ONE COULD HAVE SWORN THAT ONE HAD SEEN HIM BEFORE SEATED ON A BENCH IN A POLICE COURT AWAITING TRIAL OR AMONG VAGABONDS WHO PASSED THEIR TIME BEGGING BEFORE THE PRISON DOORS
lbi-6123-59150-0044 AT ALL OTHER TIMES HE CARRIED THAT LOOK OF SAD AND GENTLE MEEKNESS SEEN ON THE IMAGES OF OLD SLAVONIC SAINTS
lbi-6123-59150-0045 THAT IS THE PORTRAIT OF THE MAN ONE SEES BEHIND DOSTOEVSKY'S NOVELS A PORTRAIT ONE MIGHT ALMOST HAVE INFERRED FROM THE NOVELS
lbi-6123-59150-0046 IT IS A FIGURE THAT AT ONCE FASCINATES AND REPELS
lbi-6123-59186-0000 HE IS NOT BY TEMPERAMENT A SINGER
lbi-6123-59186-0001 HIS MUSIC IS A STILL SMALL VOICE UNEVENLY MATCHED AGAINST HIS CONSCIOUSNESS OF MIDNIGHT AND STORM
lbi-6123-59186-0002 TRUTH TO TELL MISTER HARDY IS NEITHER SUFFICIENTLY ARTICULATE NOR SUFFICIENTLY FASTIDIOUS TO BE A GREAT POET
lbi-6123-59186-0003 HE DOES NOT EXPRESS LIFE EASILY IN BEAUTIFUL WORDS OR IN IMAGES
lbi-6123-59186-0004 THUS HE WRITES IN I FOUND HER OUT THERE OF ONE WHO
lbi-6123-59186-0005 THERE COULD NOT BE AN UGLIER AND MORE PROSAIC EXAGGERATION THAN IS CONTAINED IN THE IMAGE IN THE LAST LINE
lbi-6123-59186-0006 AND PROSE INTRUDES IN THE CHOICE OF WORDS AS WELL AS IN IMAGES
lbi-6123-59186-0007 TAKE FOR EXAMPLE THE USE OF THE WORD DOMICILED IN THE PASSAGE IN THE SAME POEM ABOUT
lbi-6123-59186-0008 WHEN WE AS STRANGERS SOUGHT THEIR CATERING CARE VEILED SMILES BESPOKE THEIR THOUGHT OF WHAT WE WERE
lbi-6123-59186-0009 CATERING CARE IS AN APPALLING PHRASE
lbi-6123-59186-0010 IS A LINE OF GOOD POETRY
lbi-6123-59186-0011 YOU DID NOT COME AND MARCHING TIME DREW ON AND WORE ME NUMB YET LESS FOR LOSS OF YOUR DEAR PRESENCE THERE THAN THAT I THUS FOUND LACKING IN YOUR MAKE THAT HIGH COMPASSION WHICH CAN OVERBEAR RELUCTANCE FOR PURE LOVING KINDNESS SAKE GRIEVED I WHEN AS THE HOPE HOUR STROKED ITS SUM YOU DID NOT COME
lbi-6123-59186-0012 THERE ARE HINTS OF THE GRAND STYLE OF LYRIC POETRY IN THESE LINES BUT PHRASES LIKE IN YOUR MAKE AND AS THE HOPE HOUR STROKED ITS SUM ARE DISCORDS THAT BRING IT TUMBLING TO THE LEVELS OF VICTORIAN COMMONPLACE
lbi-6123-59186-0013 HE HAS A TEMPERAMENT SENSITIVE BEYOND THAT OF ALL BUT A FEW RECENT WRITERS TO THE PAIN AND PASSION OF HUMAN BEINGS
lbi-6123-59186-0014 ONE CAN REMEMBER POEM AFTER POEM OF HIS WITH A THEME THAT MIGHT EASILY HAVE SERVED FOR MISTER HARDY TOO LATE CRISTINA THE LOST MISTRESS THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER THE STATUE AND THE BUST TO NAME A FEW
lbi-6123-59186-0015 BUT WHAT A SENSE OF TRIUMPH THERE IS IN BROWNING'S TRAGEDIES
lbi-6123-59186-0016 HIS WORLD IS A PLACE OF OPULENCE NOT OF POVERTY
lbi-6123-59186-0017 TO HAVE LOVED EVEN FOR AN HOUR IS WITH BROWNING TO LIVE FOR EVER AFTER IN THE INHERITANCE OF A MIGHTY ACHIEVEMENT
lbi-6123-59186-0018 TO HAVE LOVED FOR AN HOUR IS IN MISTER HARDY'S IMAGINATION TO HAVE DEEPENED THE SADNESS EVEN MORE THAN THE BEAUTY OF ONE'S MEMORIES
lbi-6123-59186-0019 FOR THEN I UNDISTREST BY HEARTS GROWN COLD TO ME COULD LONELY WAIT MY ENDLESS REST WITH EQUANIMITY
lbi-6123-59186-0020 BUT TIME TO MAKE ME GRIEVE PART STEALS LETS PART ABIDE AND SHAKES THIS FRAGILE FRAME AT EVE WITH THROBBINGS OF NOONTIDE
lbi-6123-59186-0021 AND DESPAIR IS BY NO MEANS TRIUMPHANT IN WHAT IS PERHAPS THE MOST ATTRACTIVE OF ALL MISTER HARDY'S POEMS THE OXEN
lbi-6123-59186-0022 WE PICTURED THE MEEK MILD CREATURES WHERE THEY DWELT IN THEIR STRAWY PEN NOR DID IT OCCUR TO ONE OF US THERE TO DOUBT THEY WERE KNEELING THEN
lbi-6123-59186-0023 THE MOOD OF FAITH HOWEVER OR RATHER OF DELIGHT IN THE MEMORY OF FAITH IS NOT MISTER HARDY'S PREVAILING MOOD
lbi-6123-59186-0024 HE CAN ENTER UPON A WAR WITHOUT IRONICAL DOUBTS AS WE SEE IN THE SONG MEN WHO MARCH AWAY
lbi-6123-59186-0025 HOW LONG HE CRIES IN A POEM WRITTEN SOME YEARS AGO
lbi-6123-59186-0026 WHEN SHALL THE SANER SOFTER POLITIES WHEREOF WE DREAM HAVE SWAY IN EACH PROUD LAND AND PATRIOTISM GROWN GODLIKE SCORN TO STAND BONDSLAVE TO REALMS BUT CIRCLE EARTH AND SEAS
lbi-6123-59186-0027 BUT PERHAPS HIS CHARACTERISTIC ATTITUDE TO WAR IS TO BE FOUND NOT IN LINES LIKE THESE BUT IN THAT MELANCHOLY POEM THE SOULS OF THE SLAIN IN WHICH THE SOULS OF THE DEAD SOLDIERS RETURN TO THEIR COUNTRY AND QUESTION A SENIOR SOUL FLAME AS TO HOW THEIR FRIENDS AND RELATIVES HAVE KEPT THEIR DOUGHTY DEEDS IN REMEMBRANCE
lbi-6123-59186-0028 AND GENERAL HOW HOLD OUT OUR SWEETHEARTS SWORN LOYAL AS DOVES
lbi-6123-59186-0029 SOME FICKLE AND FLEET HEARTS HAVE FOUND THEM NEW LOVES
lbi-6123-59186-0030 AND OUR WIVES QUOTH ANOTHER RESIGNEDLY DWELL THEY ON OUR DEEDS
lbi-6123-59186-0031 MISTER HARDY HAS TOO BITTER A SENSE OF REALITY TO BELIEVE MUCH IN THE GLORY OF WAR
lbi-6123-59186-0032 THE REAL WORLD TO MISTER HARDY IS THE WORLD OF ANCIENT HUMAN THINGS IN WHICH WAR HAS COME TO BE A HIDEOUS IRRELEVANCE
lbi-6123-59186-0033 IT MAY BE THOUGHT ON THE OTHER HAND THAT MISTER HARDY'S POEMS ABOUT WAR ARE NO MORE EXPRESSIVE OF TRAGIC FUTILITY THAN HIS POEMS ABOUT LOVE
lbi-6123-59186-0034 FUTILITY AND FRUSTRATION ARE EVER RECURRING THEMES IN BOTH
lbi-6123-59186-0035 HIS LOVERS LIKE HIS SOLDIERS ROT IN THE GRAVE DEFEATED OF THEIR GLORY
lbi-6123-59186-0036 LOVERS ARE ALWAYS SEVERED BOTH IN LIFE AND IN DEATH
lbi-6123-59186-0037 IN BEYOND THE LAST LAMP WE HAVE THE SAME MOURNFUL CRY OVER SEVERANCE
lbi-6123-59186-0038 NO SHADE OF PINNACLE OR TREE OR TOWER WHILE EARTH ENDURES WILL FALL ON MY MOUND AND WITHIN THE HOUR STEAL ON TO YOURS ONE ROBIN NEVER HAUNT OUR TWO GREEN COVERTURES
lbi-6123-59186-0039 THEY BRING US FACE TO FACE WITH AN EXPERIENCE INTENSER THAN OUR OWN
lbi-6123-59186-0040 NOTHING OF TINIEST WORTH HAVE I WROUGHT PONDERED PLANNED NO ONE THING ASKING BLAME OR PRAISE SINCE THE PALE CORPSE LIKE BIRTH OF THIS DIURNAL UNIT BEARING BLANKS IN ALL ITS RAYS DULLEST OF DULL HUED DAYS
lbi-6267-53049-0000 IT'S A SAD THING FOR A BODY TO LACK BRAINS WHEN SHE WANTS TO BE A TEACHER ISN'T IT
lbi-6267-53049-0001 PENELOPE HAS STUDIED SO HARD ALL WINTER AND SHE HASN'T GONE ANYWHERE THOUGHT THE OLDER SISTER WISTFULLY
lbi-6267-53049-0002 DORIS DREAMED OF PRETTY DRESSES ALL THAT NIGHT AND THOUGHT ABOUT THEM ALL THE NEXT DAY
lbi-6267-53049-0003 SO IT MUST BE CONFESSED DID PENELOPE THOUGH SHE WOULD NOT HAVE ADMITTED IT FOR THE WORLD
lbi-6267-53049-0004 SHE KNEW THAT PENELOPE HAD STARTED OUT TO SAY A NEW DRESS
lbi-6267-53049-0005 DORIS HUNTER I BELIEVE IT'S AN OLD QUILT
lbi-6267-53049-0006 LISTEN PENELOPE MY DEAR DORIS
lbi-6267-53049-0007 LOVE TO PENELOPE AND YOURSELF
lbi-6267-53049-0008 YOUR AFFECTIONATE AUNT ADELLA HUNTER
lbi-6267-53049-0009 I DON'T SEE ITS BEAUTY SAID PENELOPE WITH A GRIMACE
lbi-6267-53049-0010 IT MAY HAVE BEEN PRETTY ONCE BUT IT IS ALL FADED NOW
lbi-6267-53049-0011 TELL ME DORRIE DOES IT ARGUE A LACK OF PROPER RESPECT FOR MY ANCESTORS THAT I CAN'T FEEL VERY ENTHUSIASTIC OVER THIS HEIRLOOM ESPECIALLY WHEN GRANDMOTHER HUNTER DIED YEARS BEFORE I WAS BORN
lbi-6267-53049-0012 IT WAS VERY KIND OF AUNT ADELLA TO SEND IT SAID DORIS DUTIFULLY
lbi-6267-53049-0013 WHY THE WRONG SIDE IS EVER SO MUCH PRETTIER THAN THE RIGHT EXCLAIMED PENELOPE
lbi-6267-53049-0014 WHAT LOVELY OLD TIMEY STUFF AND NOT A BIT FADED
lbi-6267-53049-0015 I DECLARE IT IS AS GOOD AS NEW
lbi-6267-53049-0016 WELL LET US GO AND HAVE TEA SAID PENELOPE I'M DECIDEDLY HUNGRY
lbi-6267-53049-0017 BESIDES I SEE THE POVERTY PUCKER COMING
lbi-6267-53049-0018 IT IS SOMETHING TO POSSESS AN HEIRLOOM AFTER ALL
lbi-6267-53049-0019 PENELOPE WAS SURPRISED AS MUCH AS THE TENDER SISTERLY HEART COULD WISH WHEN DORIS FLASHED OUT UPON HER TRIUMPHANTLY ON THE EVENING OF THE PARTY WITH THE BLACK SKIRT NICELY PRESSED AND RE HUNG AND THE PRETTIEST WAIST IMAGINABLE A WAIST THAT WAS A POSITIVE CREATION OF DAINTY ROSE BESPRINKLED SILK WITH A GIRDLE AND KNOTS OF BLACK VELVET
lbi-6267-53049-0020 SO PENELOPE WENT TO BLANCHE'S PARTY AND HER DRESS WAS THE ADMIRATION OF EVERY GIRL THERE
lbi-6267-53049-0021 PENELOPE THOUGHT HER ALTOGETHER CHARMING
lbi-6267-53049-0022 SHE LOOKS AS IF SHE HAD JUST STEPPED OUT OF THE FRAME OF SOME LOVELY OLD PICTURE SHE SAID TO HERSELF
lbi-6267-53049-0023 MY AUNT ADELLA GAVE ME GAVE US THE MATERIAL SHE STAMMERED
lbi-6267-53049-0024 I AM NAMED AFTER HER MISSUS FAIRWEATHER SUDDENLY PUT HER ARM ABOUT PENELOPE AND DREW THE YOUNG GIRL TO HER HER LOVELY OLD FACE AGLOW WITH DELIGHT AND TENDERNESS
lbi-6267-53049-0025 THEN YOU ARE MY GRANDNIECE SHE SAID
lbi-6267-53049-0026 WHEN I SAW YOUR DRESS I FELT SURE YOU WERE RELATED TO HER I SHOULD RECOGNIZE THAT ROSEBUD SILK IF I CAME ACROSS IT IN THIBET
lbi-6267-53049-0027 PENELOPE WAS FOUR YEARS OLDER THAN I WAS BUT WE WERE DEVOTED TO EACH OTHER
lbi-6267-53049-0028 SOON AFTER THIS OUR MOTHER DIED AND OUR HOUSEHOLD WAS BROKEN UP
lbi-6267-53049-0029 MY DEAR I AM A VERY LONELY OLD WOMAN WITH NOBODY BELONGING TO ME
lbi-6267-53049-0030 NOW SHE PATTED MISSUS FAIRWEATHER'S SOFT OLD HAND AFFECTIONATELY
lbi-6267-53049-0031 DORIS AND PENELOPE FOUND THEIR LIVES AND PLANS CHANGED IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE
lbi-6267-53049-0032 WHEN MISSUS FAIRWEATHER HAD GONE DORIS AND PENELOPE LOOKED AT EACH OTHER
lbi-6267-65525-0000 AS SHE SLIPPED INTO HER BLUE PRINT AFTERNOON DRESS HER AUNT CALLED TO HER FROM BELOW
lbi-6267-65525-0001 AUNT JANE WAS STANDING AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS WITH A LAMP IN ONE HAND AND A YEAR OLD BABY CLINGING TO THE OTHER
lbi-6267-65525-0002 SHE WAS A BIG SHAPELESS WOMAN WITH A ROUND GOOD NATURED FACE CHEERFUL AND VULGAR AS A SUNFLOWER WAS AUNT JANE AT ALL TIMES AND OCCASIONS
lbi-6267-65525-0003 I WANT TO RUN OVER AND SEE HOW MISSUS BRIXBY IS THIS EVENING SIDDY AND YOU MUST TAKE CARE OF THE BABY TILL I GET BACK
lbi-6267-65525-0004 SIDNEY SIGHED AND WENT DOWNSTAIRS FOR THE BABY
lbi-6267-65525-0005 ALL HER DAYS WERE ALIKE AS FAR AS HARD WORK AND DULLNESS WENT BUT SHE ACCEPTED THEM CHEERFULLY AND UNCOMPLAININGLY
lbi-6267-65525-0006 BUT SHE DID RESENT HAVING TO LOOK AFTER THE BABY WHEN SHE WANTED TO WRITE HER LETTER
lbi-6267-65525-0007 THE ROOM WAS SMALL A MERE BOX ABOVE THE KITCHEN WHICH SIDNEY SHARED WITH TWO SMALL COUSINS
lbi-6267-65525-0008 HER BED AND THE COT WHERE THE LITTLE GIRLS SLEPT FILLED UP ALMOST ALL THE AVAILABLE SPACE
lbi-6267-65525-0009 JUST AT THAT PARTICULAR ANGLE ONE EYE APPEARED TO BE AS LARGE AS AN ORANGE WHILE THE OTHER WAS THE SIZE OF A PEA AND THE MOUTH ZIGZAGGED FROM EAR TO EAR
lbi-6267-65525-0010 SIDNEY HATED THAT MIRROR AS VIRULENTLY AS SHE COULD HATE ANYTHING
lbi-6267-65525-0011 HER MOTHER HAD DIED THE DAY AFTER AND SIDNEY THEREUPON HAD COME INTO THE HANDS OF GOOD AUNT JANE WITH THOSE BOOKS FOR HER DOWRY SINCE NOTHING ELSE WAS LEFT AFTER THE EXPENSES OF THE DOUBLE FUNERAL HAD BEEN PAID
lbi-6267-65525-0012 PRESENTLY SHE BEGAN TO WRITE WITH A FLUSH OF REAL EXCITEMENT ON HER FACE
lbi-6267-65525-0013 ONLY ONE ANSWER CAME TO ELLEN DOUGLAS AND THAT WAS FORWARDED TO HER BY THE LONG SUFFERING EDITOR OF THE MAPLE LEAF
lbi-6267-65525-0014 HE WROTE THAT ALTHOUGH HIS AGE DEBARRED HIM FROM MEMBERSHIP IN THE CLUB HE WAS TWENTY AND THE LIMIT WAS EIGHTEEN HE READ THE LETTERS OF THE DEPARTMENT WITH MUCH INTEREST AND OFTEN HAD THOUGHT OF ANSWERING SOME OF THE REQUESTS FOR CORRESPONDENTS
lbi-6267-65525-0015 HE NEVER HAD DONE SO BUT ELLEN DOUGLAS'S LETTER WAS SO INTERESTING THAT HE HAD DECIDED TO WRITE TO HER
lbi-6267-65525-0016 WOULD SHE BE KIND ENOUGH TO CORRESPOND WITH HIM
lbi-6267-65525-0017 HE WAS TWO YEARS OUT FROM THE EAST AND HAD NOT YET FORGOTTEN TO BE HOMESICK AT TIMES
lbi-6267-65525-0018 SIDNEY LIKED THE LETTER AND ANSWERED IT
lbi-6267-65525-0019 SHE NEVER EXPECTED TO MEET JOHN LINCOLN NOR DID SHE WISH TO DO SO
lbi-6267-65525-0020 IN THE CORRESPONDENCE ITSELF SHE FOUND HER PLEASURE
lbi-6267-65525-0021 JOHN LINCOLN WROTE BREEZY ACCOUNTS OF RANCH LIFE AND ADVENTURES ON THE FAR WESTERN PLAINS SO ALIEN AND REMOTE FROM SNUG HUMDRUM PLAINFIELD LIFE THAT SIDNEY ALWAYS HAD THE SENSATION OF CROSSING A GULF WHEN SHE OPENED A LETTER FROM THE BAR N AS FOR SIDNEY'S OWN LETTER THIS IS THE WAY IT READ AS SHE WROTE IT
lbi-6267-65525-0022 THE EVERGREENS PLAINFIELD DEAR MISTER LINCOLN
lbi-6267-65525-0023 I LOVE LIFE AND ITS BLOOM AND BRILLIANCY I LOVE MEETING NEW PEOPLE I LOVE THE RIPPLE OF MUSIC THE HUM OF LAUGHTER AND CONVERSATION
lbi-6267-65525-0024 THE MAN I HAD BEEN TALKING WITH WAS PAUL MOORE THE GREAT NOVELIST
lbi-6267-65525-0025 AS IT WAS I HAD CONTRADICTED HIM TWICE AND HE HAD LAUGHED AND LIKED IT BUT HIS BOOKS WILL ALWAYS HAVE A NEW MEANING TO ME HENCEFORTH THROUGH THE INSIGHT HE HIMSELF HAS GIVEN ME
lbi-6267-65525-0026 IT IS SUCH MEETINGS AS THESE THAT GIVE LIFE ITS SPARKLE FOR ME
lbi-6267-65525-0027 YOU WILL BE WEARY OF MY RHAPSODIES OVER HER
lbi-6267-65525-0028 SHE HAS SYMPATHY AND UNDERSTANDING FOR MY EVERY MOOD
lbi-6267-65525-0029 YOURS SINCERELY SIDNEY RICHMOND
lbi-6267-65525-0030 AUNT JANE CAME HOME PRESENTLY AND CARRIED AWAY HER SLEEPING BABY SIDNEY SAID HER PRAYERS WENT TO BED AND SLEPT SOUNDLY AND SERENELY SHE MAILED HER LETTER THE NEXT DAY AND A MONTH LATER AN ANSWER CAME
lbi-6267-65525-0031 SIDNEY DID NOT SLEEP THAT NIGHT BUT TOSSED RESTLESSLY ABOUT OR CRIED IN HER PILLOW
lbi-6267-65525-0032 THE GOOD WOMAN SHOOK HER HEAD
lbi-6267-65525-0033 SIDNEY TROD THE WAY OF THE TRANSGRESSOR AND FOUND THAT ITS THORNS PIERCED TO BONE AND MARROW
lbi-6267-65525-0034 YOU SEE THAT ROAD OUT THAR
lbi-6267-65525-0035 AND THERE WAS NO HARBOUR OR GLIMPSE OF DISTANT SEA VISIBLE
lbi-6267-65525-0036 HAD THE HOTEL KEEPER MADE A MISTAKE
lbi-6267-65525-0037 THIS IS HIS PLACE NOBODY CALLS IT THE EVERGREENS BUT MYSELF
lbi-6267-65525-0038 I DON'T UNDERSTAND HE SAID PERPLEXEDLY
lbi-6267-65525-0039 OH SIDNEY THREW OUT HER HANDS IN A BURST OF PASSIONATE PROTEST
lbi-6267-65525-0040 NO AND YOU NEVER WILL UNDERSTAND I CAN'T MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND
lbi-6267-65525-0041 EVERYTHING I TOLD YOU ABOUT IT AND MY LIFE WAS JUST IMAGINATION
lbi-6267-65525-0042 THEN WHY DID YOU WRITE THEM HE ASKED BLANKLY
lbi-6267-65525-0043 WHY DID YOU DECEIVE ME
lbi-6267-65525-0044 OH I DIDN'T MEAN TO DECEIVE YOU I NEVER THOUGHT OF SUCH A THING
lbi-6267-65525-0045 I JUST COULDN'T WRITE YOU ABOUT MY LIFE HERE NOT BECAUSE IT WAS HARD BUT IT WAS SO UGLY AND EMPTY
lbi-6267-65525-0046 AND WHEN ONCE I HAD BEGUN I HAD TO KEEP IT UP
lbi-6267-65525-0047 I FOUND IT SO FASCINATING TOO
lbi-6267-65525-0048 THOSE LETTERS MADE THAT OTHER LIFE SEEM REAL TO ME I NEVER EXPECTED TO MEET YOU
lbi-6267-65525-0049 THESE LAST FOUR DAYS SINCE YOUR LETTER CAME HAVE BEEN DREADFUL TO ME
lbi-6267-65525-0050 OH PLEASE GO AWAY AND FORGIVE ME IF YOU CAN
lbi-6267-65525-0051 IT WAS WORSE THAN SHE HAD EVEN THOUGHT IT WOULD BE
lbi-6267-65525-0052 HE WAS SO HANDSOME SO MANLY SO EARNEST EYED
lbi-6267-65525-0053 JOHN LINCOLN OPENED THE GATE AND WENT UP TO HER
lbi-6267-65525-0054 PLEASE DON'T DISTRESS YOURSELF SO SIDNEY HE SAID UNCONSCIOUSLY USING HER CHRISTIAN NAME
lbi-6267-65525-0055 I THINK I DO UNDERSTAND
lbi-6267-65525-0056 I'M NOT SUCH A DULL FELLOW AS YOU TAKE ME FOR
lbi-6267-65525-0057 AFTER ALL THOSE LETTERS WERE TRUE OR RATHER THERE WAS TRUTH IN THEM
lbi-6267-65525-0058 THIS YOUNG MAN WAS CERTAINLY GOOD AT UNDERSTANDING
lbi-6267-65525-0059 YOU YOU'LL FORGIVE ME THEN SHE STAMMERED
lbi-6455-66379-0000 HALLO COLONEL HOW D'YE SELL YOUR WOOD THIS TIME
lbi-6455-66379-0001 WHY CAPTING WE MUST CHARGE YOU THREE AND A QUARTER THIS TIME THE D L
lbi-6455-66379-0002 SUPPER WAS OVER AND I RETIRED TO MY UPPER BERTH SITUATED ALONGSIDE AND OVERLOOKING THE BRAG TABLE WHERE THE CAPTAIN WAS DEEPLY ENGAGED HAVING NOW THE OTHER PILOT AS HIS PRINCIPAL OPPONENT
lbi-6455-66379-0003 HEAD HER IN SHORE THEN AND TAKE IN SIX CORDS IF IT'S GOOD SEE TO IT THOMPSON I CAN'T VERY WELL LEAVE THE GAME NOW IT'S GETTING RIGHT WARM

lbi-6455-66379-0007 OH PRETTY GLIBLY SIR REPLIED THE MATE WE CAN SCARCELY TELL WHAT HEADWAY WE ARE MAKING FOR WE ARE OBLIGED TO KEEP THE MIDDLE OF THE RIVER AND THERE IS THE SHADOW OF A FOG RISING

lbi-6455-67803-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY THREE MAY I GO
lbi-6455-67803-0001 THE VERY DAY AFTER THIS OCTAVIA OPENED THE FOURTH TRUNK
lbi-6455-67803-0002 EVIDENTLY SOMETHING HAD HAPPENED OCTAVIA SHE SAID MISTER DUGALD BINNIE IS AT OLDCLOUGH WHO IS HE
lbi-6455-67803-0003 HE IS MY GRAND UNCLE EXPLAINED LUCIA TREMULOUSLY HE HAS A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY
lbi-6455-67803-0004 I DO NOT QUITE UNDERSTAND GRANDMAMMA OCTAVIA SHE SAID
lbi-6455-67803-0005 LAST NIGHT SHE CAME TO MY ROOM TO TALK TO ME AND THIS MORNING SHE CAME AGAIN AND OH
lbi-6455-67803-0006 SHE BROKE OUT INDIGNANTLY HOW COULD SHE SPEAK TO ME IN SUCH A MANNER
lbi-6455-67803-0007 WHAT DID YOU UNDERSTAND
lbi-6455-67803-0008 I AM TO RUN AFTER A MAN WHO DOES NOT CARE FOR ME AND MAKE MYSELF ATTRACTIVE IN THE HOPE THAT HE WILL CONDESCEND TO MARRY ME BECAUSE MISTER BINNIE MAY LEAVE ME HIS MONEY
lbi-6455-67803-0009 DO YOU WONDER THAT IT TOOK EVEN LADY THEOBALD A LONG TIME TO SAY THAT
lbi-6455-67803-0010 WELL REMARKED OCTAVIA YOU WON'T DO IT I SUPPOSE I WOULDN'T WORRY
lbi-6455-67803-0011 OH I ALWAYS KNEW IT I DIDN'T GUESS
lbi-6455-67803-0012 AND SHE SMILED EVER SO FAINTLY
lbi-6455-67803-0013 THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY SHE LOATHES ME SO SHE ADDED
lbi-6455-67803-0014 LUCIA THOUGHT DEEPLY FOR A MOMENT SHE RECOGNIZED ALL AT ONCE SEVERAL THINGS SHE HAD BEEN MYSTIFIED BY BEFORE
lbi-6455-67803-0015 OCTAVIA SMILED A LITTLE AGAIN
lbi-6455-67803-0016 LUCIA SAT THINKING HER HANDS CLASPED TIGHTLY
lbi-6455-67803-0017 I AM GLAD I CAME HERE SHE SAID AT LENGTH
lbi-6455-67803-0018 I THINK I SHALL NEVER BE AFRAID OF HER ANY MORE
lbi-6455-67803-0019 HER DELICATE NOSTRILS WERE DILATED SHE HELD HER HEAD UP HER BREATH CAME FAST THERE WAS A HINT OF EXULTATION IN HER TONE
lbi-6455-67803-0020 SHE WALKED VERY FAST AFTER SHE LEFT THE HOUSE
lbi-6455-67803-0021 BUT IT WAS NOT AGAINST HIM THAT LUCIA'S INDIGNATION WAS AROUSED
lbi-6455-67803-0022 SHE WONDERED IF HE HAD HEARD HER LAST WORDS SHE FANCIED HE HAD
lbi-6455-67803-0023 HE TOOK HOLD OF HER SHAKING LITTLE HAND AND LOOKED DOWN AT HER EXCITED FACE
lbi-6455-67803-0024 I AM ANGRY SHE SAID YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN ME ANGRY BEFORE
lbi-6455-67803-0025 I AM ON MY WAY TO MY TO LADY THEOBALD
lbi-6455-67803-0026 HE HELD HER HAND AS CALMLY AS BEFORE
lbi-6455-67803-0027 WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO SAY TO HER HE ASKED SHE LAUGHED AGAIN
lbi-6455-67803-0028 HE HELD HER HAND RATHER CLOSER
lbi-6455-67803-0029 SHE HAS MADE YOU VERY ANGRY HE SAID
lbi-6455-67803-0030 AND THEN ALMOST BEFORE SHE KNEW WHAT SHE WAS DOING SHE WAS POURING FORTH THE WHOLE OF HER STORY EVEN MORE OF IT THAN SHE HAD TOLD OCTAVIA
lbi-6455-67803-0031 LUCIA HE SAID I WISH YOU WOULD LET ME GO AND TALK WITH LADY THEOBALD YOU SHE SAID WITH A LITTLE START
lbi-6455-67803-0032 YES HE ANSWERED LET ME GO TO HER
lbi-6455-67803-0033 IF YOU WILL SAY YES TO THAT I THINK I CAN PROMISE THAT YOU NEED NEVER BE AFRAID OF HER ANY MORE
lbi-6455-67803-0034 THE FIERCE COLOR DIED OUT OF HER CHEEKS AND THE TEARS RUSHED TO HER EYES
lbi-6455-67803-0035 SHE RAISED HER FACE WITH A PATHETIC LOOK
lbi-6455-67803-0036 I AM DESPERATELY IN LOVE WITH YOU HE ANSWERED IN HIS QUIETEST WAY
lbi-6455-67804-0000 I ACCOMPANY MY GRANDDAUGHTER TO THIS THIS ENTERTAINMENT HER LADYSHIP RESPONDED
lbi-6455-67804-0001 IT IS SCARCELY A JOYOUS OCCASION TO MY MIND
lbi-6455-67804-0002 NO NEED TO DRESS YOURSELF LIKE THAT IF IT ISN'T EJACULATED MISTER BINNIE
lbi-6455-67804-0003 IF I WERE SURE THIS WAS THE SAME MAN I'D GO MYSELF
lbi-6455-67804-0004 WHEN I FIND A FELLOW WHO'S NEITHER KNAVE NOR FOOL I STICK TO HIM BELIEVE I'LL SEND TO FIND OUT
lbi-6455-67804-0005 THE ONLY TIME HE HAD MADE ANY COMMENT UPON HER WAS THE FIRST TIME HE SAW HER IN THE DRESS SHE HAD COPIED FROM OCTAVIA'S NICE GOWN THAT HE BLURTED OUT DIDN'T GET IT HERE I'LL WAGER
lbi-6455-67804-0006 DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT HE SAID GRUFFLY
lbi-6455-67804-0007 NO SHE ANSWERED I AM NOT AFRAID AT ALL
lbi-6455-67804-0008 I SHALL NOT BE AFRAID AGAIN
lbi-6455-67804-0009 IN FACT SHE HAD PERFECTLY CONFOUNDED HER LADYSHIP BY HER DEMEANOR
lbi-6455-67804-0010 I BEG YOU WILL NOT SPEAK TO ME OF THAT AGAIN SHE SAID I WILL NOT LISTEN
lbi-6455-67804-0011 AND TURNING ABOUT SHE WALKED OUT OF THE ROOM
lbi-6455-67804-0012 AND NOTHING MORE HAD BEEN SAID ON THE SUBJECT SINCE
lbi-6455-67804-0013 BEFORE BREAKFAST MISS BELINDA WAS STARTLED BY THE ARRIVAL OF ANOTHER TELEGRAM WHICH RAN AS FOLLOWS

lbi-6455-67804-0017 OCTAVIA WAS A MARKED FIGURE UPON THE GROUNDS AT THAT GARDEN PARTY ANOTHER DRESS MY DEAR REMARKED MISSUS BURNHAM
lbi-6455-67804-0018 AND WHAT A CHARMING COLOR SHE HAS I DECLARE SHE IS USUALLY PALER

lbi-6455-67804-0020 SHE'S PRETTIER THAN EVER TO DAY AND IS ENJOYING HERSELF
lbi-6455-67804-0021 SHE WAS ENJOYING HERSELF MISTER FRANCIS BAROLD OBSERVED IT RATHER GLOOMILY AS HE STOOD APART
lbi-6455-67804-0022 AND THEN HAD COME LORD LANSDOWNE WHO IN CROSSING THE LAWN TO SHAKE HANDS WITH HIS HOST HAD BEEN OBSERVED TO KEEP HIS EYE FIXED UPON ONE PARTICULAR POINT BURMISTONE HE SAID AFTER HAVING SPOKEN HIS FIRST WORDS WHO IS THAT TALL GIRL IN WHITE
lbi-6455-67804-0023 AND IN TEN MINUTES LADY THEOBALD MISSUS BURNHAM MISTER BAROLD AND DIVERS OTHERS TOO NUMEROUS TO MENTION SAW HIM STANDING AT OCTAVIA'S SIDE EVIDENTLY WITH NO INTENTION OF LEAVING IT

lbi-6455-67804-0026 VERY FEW PEOPLE UNDERSTAND OCTAVIA SAID MISS BELINDA I'M NOT SURE THAT I FOLLOW ALL HER MOODS MYSELF
lbi-6455-67804-0027 SHE IS NOT AS FRIVOLOUS AS SHE APPEARS TO THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW HER WELL
lbi-6455-67804-0028 BAROLD STOOD GNAWING HIS MUSTACHE AND MADE NO REPLY HE WAS NOT VERY COMFORTABLE
lbi-6455-67804-0029 HE FELT HIMSELF ILL USED BY FATE AND RATHER WISHED HE HAD RETURNED TO LONDON FROM BROADOAKS INSTEAD OF LOITERING IN SLOWBRIDGE
lbi-6455-67804-0030 HE HAD AMUSED HIMSELF AT FIRST BUT IN TIME HE HAD BEEN SURPRISED TO FIND HIS AMUSEMENT LOSE SOMETHING OF ITS ZEST
lbi-6455-67804-0031 IT'S DEUCEDLY BAD FORM ON HIS PART HE SAID MENTALLY WHAT DOES HE MEAN BY IT
lbi-6455-67804-0032 OCTAVIA ON THE CONTRARY DID NOT ASK WHAT HE MEANT BY IT
lbi-6455-67804-0033 WHERE HE EJACULATED I SAY WHAT A NAME

lbi-6455-67804-0038 I HAVE REMAINED HERE LONGER THAN I INTENDED
lbi-6455-67804-0039 SHE BEGAN TO MOVE THE MANACLES ON HER RIGHT WRIST
lbi-6455-67804-0040 SHE HAD NOT BROUGHT LUCIA UP UNDER HER OWN EYE FOR NOTHING
lbi-6467-56885-0000 HIS BODY WAS LONG AND SLENDER HARD AND AGILE HIS SIGHT KEEN HIS AIM UNERRING
lbi-6467-56885-0001 IN THE MONTH OF AGRAHAYAN KANTI HAD GONE OUT SHOOTING NEAR THE SWAMP OF NYDIGHI WITH A FEW SPORTING COMPANIONS
lbi-6467-56885-0002 ONE MORNING AS KANTI WAS SEATED IN HIS BOAT CLEANING A FAVOURITE GUN HE SUDDENLY STARTED AT WHAT HE THOUGHT WAS THE CRY OF WILD DUCK LOOKING UP HE SAW A VILLAGE MAIDEN COMING TO THE WATER'S EDGE WITH TWO WHITE DUCKLINGS CLASPED TO HER BREAST
lbi-6467-56885-0003 THE GIRL PUT THE BIRDS INTO THE WATER AND WATCHED THEM ANXIOUSLY
lbi-6467-56885-0004 LOOKING ROUND KANTI SAW ONE OF HIS MEN POINTING AN UNLOADED GUN AT THE DUCKS
lbi-6467-56885-0005 KANTI WENT ON CLEANING HIS GUN
lbi-6467-56885-0006 AFTER KANTI HAD EATEN AND DRUNK THE BRAHMIN BEGGED HIM TO INTRODUCE HIMSELF KANTI GAVE HIS OWN NAME HIS FATHER'S NAME AND THE ADDRESS OF HIS HOME AND THEN SAID IN THE USUAL WAY IF I CAN BE OF ANY SERVICE SIR I SHALL DEEM MYSELF FORTUNATE
lbi-6467-56885-0007 SO SAYING KANTI REPEATED HIS SALUTE AND WENT BACK
lbi-6467-56885-0008 THE BRICK BUILT MANSION OF THE MAZUMDARS HAD BEEN BORROWED FOR THE WEDDING CEREMONY WHICH WAS FIXED FOR NEXT MAGH AS KANTI DID NOT WISH TO DELAY
lbi-6467-56885-0009 IN DUE TIME THE BRIDEGROOM ARRIVED ON HIS ELEPHANT WITH DRUMS AND MUSIC AND WITH A TORCHLIGHT PROCESSION AND THE CEREMONY BEGAN
lbi-6467-56885-0010 IN THAT BASHFUL DOWNCAST FACE CROWNED WITH THE WEDDING CORONET AND BEDECKED WITH SANDAL PASTE HE COULD SCARCELY RECOGNISE THE VILLAGE MAIDEN OF HIS FANCY AND IN THE FULNESS OF HIS EMOTION A MIST SEEMED TO BECLOUD HIS EYES
lbi-6467-56885-0011 THE LIGHT OF THE LAMPS SEEMED TO GROW DIM AND DARKNESS TO TARNISH THE FACE OF THE BRIDE HERSELF
lbi-6467-56885-0012 AT FIRST HE FELT ANGRY WITH HIS FATHER IN LAW THE OLD SCOUNDREL HAD SHOWN HIM ONE GIRL AND MARRIED HIM TO ANOTHER
lbi-6467-56885-0013 CLOSE UPON IT FOLLOWED THE GIRL HE HAD SEEN BEFORE

lbi-6467-56885-0015 ALL THE WOMEN IN THE ROOM BEGAN TO TITTER
lbi-6467-56885-0016 THE INCREASING LAUGHTER IN THE ROOM BETOKENED AN AMUSING JOKE
lbi-6467-56885-0017 WITH A SIGH OF INTENSE RELIEF AS OF ESCAPE FROM CALAMITY HE LOOKED ONCE MORE INTO THE FACE OF HIS BRIDE
lbi-6467-62797-0000 OUT OF CURIOSITY HE HUNG ONE OF THEM OUTSIDE HIS HOUSE

lbi-6467-94831-0043 I GUESS I KNOW A DONKEY'S HEAD WHEN I SEE IT MASTER ROVER
lbi-6467-94831-0044 PELEG THERE IS SOME MISTAKE HERE
lbi-6467-94831-0045 OH YOU CAN'T JOKE ME NO MORE
lbi-6467-97061-0000 ONE NIGHT WHEN BOTH WERE SLEEPING THE PRINCE HAD A REMARKABLE DREAM
lbi-6467-97061-0001 THEY RUSHED INTO THE ROOM ADDED THEIR CRIES TO HERS AND FORGETTING ALL THEIR FORMER PRECAUTIONS LEFT THE DOORS OPEN SO THAT THE GUARDS OUTSIDE HEARING THE CLAMOUR ENTERED AND SAW THE PRINCE
lbi-6467-97061-0002 SHE IS A DISGRACE TO HER FAMILY AND SHALL SOON SEE HER HUSBAND IMPALED ON A STAKE
lbi-6467-97061-0003 THEN WITH HIS FOREHEAD DISFIGURED BY A FEARFUL FROWN HE CONTINUED TO ABUSE THE PRINCE AND HAVING TIED HIS HANDS BEHIND HIM DRAGGED HIM FROM THE ROOM
lbi-6467-97061-0004 TREATED THUS LIKE SOME WILD BEAST ROUGHLY SHAKEN AND NEGLECTED RAJAVAHANA WOULD HAVE SUFFERED GREATLY HAD HE NOT BEEN PROTECTED BY THE MAGIC JEWEL GIVEN TO HIM IN PATALA AND WHICH HE HAD CONTRIVED TO CONCEAL IN HIS HAIR
lbi-6467-97061-0005 ADVANCING THEREFORE WITH A LARGE ARMY HE PREPARED TO BESIEGE CHAMPA THE CAPITAL CITY
lbi-6467-97061-0006 A TERRIBLE BATTLE ENSUED IN WHICH BOTH KINGS PERFORMED PRODIGIES OF VALOUR
lbi-6467-97061-0007 SHOULD THERE BE ANY PITY FOR THE VIOLATOR OF THE HAREM
lbi-6467-97061-0008 IF THE OLD KING MY FATHER NOW IN HIS DOTAGE WAS FOOLISH ENOUGH TO FAVOUR THE CRIMINAL FOR THE SAKE OF HIS WORTHLESS DAUGHTER YOU HAD NO NEED OF HIS PERMISSION AND OUGHT NOT TO HAVE BEEN INFLUENCED BY HIM
lbi-6467-97061-0009 LET THAT VILE SEDUCER BE IMMEDIATELY PUT TO DEATH BY TORTURE AND HIS PARAMOUR BE SHUT UP IN PRISON TILL I COME
lbi-6467-97061-0010 HAVE READY ALSO A FIERCE ELEPHANT SUITABLY EQUIPPED WHICH I SHALL MOUNT IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE WEDDING TO OVERTAKE MY ARMY IN MARCH AGAINST THE ENEMY AND AS I SET OUT I WILL MAKE THE ELEPHANT TRAMPLE THE LIFE OUT OF THAT CRIMINAL
lbi-6467-97061-0011 WHILE HE STOOD THERE CALMLY AWAITING DEATH WHICH NOW SEEMED INEVITABLE HE SUDDENLY FELT HIS FEET FREE AND A BEAUTIFUL LADY APPEARED BEFORE HIM
lbi-6467-97061-0012 SHE HUMBLY BOWING DOWN SAID LET MY LORD PARDON HIS SERVANT FOR THE INJURY WHICH SHE HAS UNCONSCIOUSLY CAUSED
lbi-6467-97061-0013 I AM AN APSARAS BORN FROM THE RAYS OF THE MOON
lbi-6467-97061-0014 ONE DAY AS I WAS FLYING THROUGH THE AIR WEARING A WHITE DRESS A SWAN MISTAKING ME FOR A LOTUS FLOWER ATTACKED ME
lbi-6467-97061-0015 IN HIS ANGER HE CURSED ME SAYING O WICKED ONE FOR THIS OFFENCE YOU ARE CONDEMNED TO BE CHANGED INTO A PIECE OF UNCONSCIOUS METAL
lbi-6467-97061-0016 THE CHANGE TOOK PLACE IMMEDIATELY AND I FELL TO THE GROUND TURNED INTO A SILVER CHAIN
lbi-6467-97061-0017 ON HIS WAY HE SAW THE SILVER FETTER DESCENDED TO THE GROUND PICKED IT UP AND CONTINUED HIS FLIGHT
lbi-6467-97061-0018 THE SLAYER OF CHANDAVARMA HEARING THIS CAME OUT OF THE PALACE AND QUICKLY MOUNTING THE ELEPHANT WHO HELD DOWN HIS TRUNK TO RECEIVE HIM PLACED HIMSELF BEHIND THE PRINCE
lbi-6467-97061-0019 GREAT WAS THEIR MUTUAL ASTONISHMENT AND JOY WHEN THEY RECOGNISED EACH OTHER THE PRINCE EXCLAIMING IS IT POSSIBLE
lbi-6467-97061-0020 IS IT REALLY YOU MY DEAR FRIEND APAHARAVARMA WHO HAVE DONE THIS DEED
lbi-6467-97061-0021 THROUGH THESE THEY FORCED THEIR WAY EMPLOYING WITH GOOD EFFECT THE WEAPONS PLACED ON THE ELEPHANT FOR THE USE OF CHANDAVARMA
lbi-6467-97061-0022 BEFORE HOWEVER THEY HAD GONE FAR THEY HEARD THE NOISE OF BATTLE AT A DISTANCE AND SAW THE SOLDIERS IN FRONT OF THEM SCATTERED IN ALL DIRECTIONS
lbi-6467-97061-0023 WE HAVE JUST NOW ENCOUNTERED AND UTTERLY DEFEATED THE ENEMY SO THAT THERE IS NO FEAR OF ANY FURTHER RESISTANCE
lbi-6467-97061-0024 RAJAVAHANA AGREED TO THIS
lbi-6599-38590-0000 WHATEVER HAND IT WAS THAT SHOT DOWN BOURBON ROME AFTER HIS DEATH WAS PLUNDERED DEVASTATED AND RAVAGED BY A BRUTAL GREEDY LICENTIOUS AND FANATICAL SOLDIERY
lbi-6599-38590-0001 WHEREFORE FOR THE FUTURE WRITE US NOTHING AT ALL BUT APPOINT US THE TIME AND PLACE OF MEETING AND WE WILL BRING OUR SWORD FOR YOU TO CROSS PROTESTING THAT THE SHAME OF ANY DELAY IN FIGHTING SHALL BE YOURS SEEING THAT WHEN IT COMES TO AN ENCOUNTER THERE IS AN END OF ALL WRITING
lbi-6599-38590-0002 SIR ANSWERED THE SPANIARD PERMIT ME TO DO MY OFFICE AND SAY WHAT THE EMPEROR HAS CHARGED ME TO SAY
lbi-6599-38590-0003 NAY I WILL NOT LISTEN TO THEE SAID FRANCIS IF THOU DO NOT FIRST GIVE ME A PATENT SIGNED BY THY MASTER CONTAINING AN APPOINTMENT OF TIME AND PLACE SIR I HAVE ORDERS TO READ YOU THE CARTEL AND GIVE IT YOU AFTERWARDS
lbi-6599-38590-0004 BURGUNDY WITHOUT BEING PUT OUT BEGAN AGAIN SIR
lbi-6599-38590-0005 NAY SAID FRANCIS I WILL NOT SUFFER HIM TO SPEAK TO ME BEFORE HE HAS GIVEN ME APPOINTMENT OF TIME AND PLACE
lbi-6599-38590-0006 GIVE IT ME OR RETURN AS THOU HAST COME
lbi-6599-38590-0007 I AM QUITE WILLING SAID THE KING LET HIM HAVE IT
lbi-6599-38590-0008 THE PEACE OF CAMBRAI WAS CALLED THE LADIES PEACE IN HONOR OF THE TWO PRINCESSES WHO HAD NEGOTIATED IT THOUGH MORALLY DIFFERENT AND OF VERY UNEQUAL WORTH THEY BOTH HAD MINDS OF A RARE ORDER AND TRAINED TO RECOGNIZE POLITICAL NECESSITIES AND NOT TO ATTEMPT ANY BUT POSSIBLE SUCCESSES
lbi-6599-38590-0009 ALL THE GREAT POLITICAL ACTORS SEEMED HURRYING AWAY FROM THE STAGE AS IF THE DRAMA WERE APPROACHING ITS END
lbi-6599-38591-0000 IN FIFTEEN SIXTY TWO AT THE BATTLE OF DREUX HE WAS AGED AND SO ILL THAT NONE EXPECTED TO SEE HIM ON HORSEBACK
lbi-6599-38591-0001 HE FULLY ARMED SAVE ONLY HIS HEAD ANSWERED HIM RIGHT WELL SIR THIS IS THE REAL MEDICINE THAT HATH CURED ME FOR THE BATTLE WHICH IS TOWARD AND A PREPARING FOR THE HONOR OF GOD AND OUR KING
lbi-6599-38591-0002 THE LADIES PEACE CONCLUDED AT CAMBRAI IN FIFTEEN TWENTY NINE LASTED UP TO FIFTEEN THIRTY SIX INCESSANTLY TROUBLED HOWEVER BY FAR FROM PACIFIC SYMPTOMS PROCEEDINGS AND PREPARATIONS
lbi-6599-38591-0003 AT LAST HE DECIDED UPON RETREATING
lbi-6599-38591-0004 IT WAS GARCILASO DE LA VEGA THE PRINCE OF SPANISH POESY THE SPANISH PETRARCH ACCORDING TO HIS FELLOW COUNTRYMEN
lbi-6599-38591-0005 MONTMORENCY SIGNED A SIMILAR ONE FOR PIEDMONT
lbi-6599-38591-0006 THEY ALL REPAIRED TOGETHER TO THE HOUSE PREPARED FOR THEIR RECEPTION AND AFTER DINNER THE EMPEROR BEING TIRED LAY DOWN TO REST ON A COUCH QUEEN ELEANOR BEFORE LONG WENT AND TAPPED AT HIS DOOR AND SENT WORD TO THE KING THAT THE EMPEROR WAS AWAKE
lbi-6599-38591-0007 FRANCIS WITH THE CARDINAL DE LORRAINE AND THE CONSTABLE DE MONTMORENCY SOON ARRIVED
lbi-6599-38591-0008 ON ENTERING THE CHAMBER HE FOUND THE EMPEROR STILL LYING DOWN AND CHATTING WITH HIS SISTER THE QUEEN WHO WAS SEATED BESIDE HIM ON A CHAIR
lbi-6599-38591-0009 YES SAID CHARLES I HAD MADE SUCH CHEER THAT I WAS OBLIGED TO SLEEP IT OFF
lbi-6599-38591-0010 FRANCIS DID THE CONVERSE WITH HIS OWN COLLAR
lbi-6599-38591-0011 ONLY SEVEN OF THE ATTENDANTS REMAINED IN THE EMPEROR'S CHAMBER AND THERE THE TWO SOVEREIGNS CONVERSED FOR AN HOUR AFTER WHICH THEY MOVED TO THE HALL WHERE A SPLENDID SUPPER AWAITED THEM
lbi-6599-38591-0012 THE GHENTESE PLEADED THEIR PRIVILEGE OF NOT BEING LIABLE TO BE TAXED WITHOUT THEIR OWN CONSENT
lbi-6599-38591-0013 ORDERS HAD BEEN SENT EVERYWHERE TO RECEIVE HIM AS KINGS OF FRANCE ARE RECEIVED ON THEIR JOYOUS ACCESSION
lbi-6841-88291-0000 BUT SINCE THERE EXISTED FOR US NO RESPONSIBILITY WE EACH REPORTED DUTIFULLY AT THE ROLL CALL OF HABIT AND DROPPED BACK INTO OUR BLANKETS WITH A GRATEFUL SIGH
lbi-6841-88291-0001 I REMEMBER THE MOON SAILING A GOOD GAIT AMONG APPARENTLY STATIONARY CLOUDLETS I RECALL A DEEP BLACK SHADOW LYING BEFORE DISTANT SILVERY MOUNTAINS I GLANCED OVER THE STARK MOTIONLESS CANVASES EACH OF WHICH CONCEALED A MAN THE AIR TREMBLED WITH THE BELLOWING OF CATTLE IN THE CORRALS
lbi-6841-88291-0002 SEEMINGLY BUT A MOMENT LATER THE COOK'S HOWL BROUGHT ME TO CONSCIOUSNESS AGAIN
lbi-6841-88291-0003 THREE WERE TO CARE FOR THE REMUDA FIVE WERE TO MOVE THE STRAY HERD FROM THE CORRALS TO GOOD FEED THREE BRANDING CREWS WERE TOLD TO BRAND THE CALVES WE HAD COLLECTED IN THE CUT OF THE AFTERNOON BEFORE THAT TOOK UP ABOUT HALF THE MEN
lbi-6841-88291-0004 THE REST WERE TO MAKE A SHORT DRIVE IN THE SALT GRASS
lbi-6841-88291-0005 WE WERE THE ONLY ONES WHO DID GO AFOOT HOWEVER ALTHOUGH THE CORRALS WERE NOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YARDS DISTANT
lbi-6841-88291-0006 BETWEEN THE UPRIGHT BARS OF GREASEWOOD WE COULD SEE THE CATTLE AND NEAR THE OPPOSITE SIDE THE MEN BUILDING A FIRE NEXT THE FENCE
lbi-6841-88291-0007 WE PUSHED OPEN THE WIDE GATE AND ENTERED
lbi-6841-88291-0008 ONE STOOD WAITING FOR THEM TO FINISH A SHEAF OF LONG J H STAMPING IRONS IN HIS HAND
lbi-6841-88291-0009 ALL THE REST SQUATTED ON THEIR HEELS ALONG THE FENCE SMOKING CIGARETTES AND CHATTING TOGETHER
lbi-6841-88291-0010 THE FIRST RAYS OF THE SUN SLANTED ACROSS IN ONE GREAT SWEEP FROM THE REMOTE MOUNTAINS
lbi-6841-88291-0011 HOMER WOODEN AND OLD CALIFORNIA JOHN RODE IN AMONG THE CATTLE
lbi-6841-88291-0012 AS THE LOOP SETTLED HE JERKED SHARPLY UPWARD EXACTLY AS ONE WOULD STRIKE TO HOOK A BIG FISH
lbi-6841-88291-0013 HOMER WRAPPED THE ROPE TWICE OR THRICE ABOUT THE HORN AND SAT OVER IN ONE STIRRUP TO AVOID THE TIGHTENED LINE AND TO PRESERVE THE BALANCE
lbi-6841-88291-0014 NOBODY PAID ANY ATTENTION TO THE CALF
lbi-6841-88291-0015 BEHIND HIM FOLLOWED HIS ANXIOUS MOTHER HER HEAD SWINGING FROM SIDE TO SIDE NEAR THE FIRE THE HORSE STOPPED
lbi-6841-88291-0016 THE TWO BULL DOGGERS IMMEDIATELY POUNCED UPON THE VICTIM
lbi-6841-88291-0017 IT WAS PROMPTLY FLOPPED OVER ON ITS RIGHT SIDE
lbi-6841-88291-0018 THUS THE CALF WAS UNABLE TO STRUGGLE
lbi-6841-88291-0019 WHEN ONCE YOU HAVE HAD THE WIND KNOCKED OUT OF YOU OR A RIB OR TWO BROKEN YOU CEASE TO THINK THIS UNNECESSARILY ROUGH
lbi-6841-88291-0020 HOT IRON YELLED ONE OF THE BULL DOGGERS
lbi-6841-88291-0021 MARKER YELLED THE OTHER
lbi-6841-88291-0022 THE BRANDER PRESSED THE IRON SMOOTHLY AGAINST THE FLANK
lbi-6841-88291-0023 PERHAPS THE CALF BLATTED A LITTLE AS THE HEAT SCORCHED
lbi-6841-88291-0024 THE BRAND SHOWED CHERRY WHICH IS THE PROPER COLOUR TO INDICATE DUE PEELING AND A SUCCESSFUL MARK
lbi-6841-88291-0025 THEN HE NICKED OUT A SWALLOW TAIL IN THE OTHER
lbi-6841-88291-0026 IT SEEMS TO ME THAT A GREAT DEAL OF UNNECESSARY TWADDLE IS ABROAD AS TO THE EXTREME CRUELTY OF BRANDING
lbi-6841-88291-0027 UNDOUBTEDLY IT IS TO SOME EXTENT PAINFUL AND COULD SOME OTHER METHOD OF READY IDENTIFICATION BE DEVISED IT MIGHT BE AS WELL TO ADOPT IT IN PREFERENCE
lbi-6841-88291-0028 INEXTINGUISHABLE LAUGHTER FOLLOWED THE SPREAD OF THIS DOCTRINE THROUGH ARIZONA
lbi-6841-88291-0029 IMAGINE A PUNCHER DESCENDING TO EXAMINE POLITELY THE EAR TAGS OF WILD CATTLE ON THE OPEN RANGE OR IN A ROUND UP
lbi-6841-88291-0030 A CALF USUALLY BELLOWS WHEN THE IRON BITES BUT AS SOON AS RELEASED HE ALMOST INVARIABLY GOES TO FEEDING OR TO LOOKING IDLY ABOUT
lbi-6841-88291-0031 BESIDES WHICH IT HAPPENS BUT ONCE IN A LIFETIME AND IS OVER IN TEN SECONDS A COMFORT DENIED TO THOSE OF US WHO HAVE OUR TEETH FILLED
lbi-6841-88291-0032 ONE OF THE LITTLE ANIMALS WAS BUT A FEW MONTHS OLD SO THE RIDER DID NOT BOTHER WITH ITS HIND LEGS BUT TOSSED HIS LOOP OVER ITS NECK
lbi-6841-88291-0033 MISTER FROST'S BULL CALF ALONE IN PICTORIAL HISTORY SHOWS THE ATTITUDES
lbi-6841-88291-0034 AND THEN OF COURSE THERE WAS THE GORGEOUS CONTRAST BETWEEN ALL THIS FRANTIC AND UNCOMPREHENDING EXCITEMENT AND THE ABSOLUTE MATTER OF FACT IMPERTURBABILITY OF HORSE AND RIDER
lbi-6841-88291-0035 AS HE KNEW HIS BUSINESS AND AS THE CALF WAS A SMALL ONE THE LITTLE BEAST WENT OVER PROMPTLY BIT THE GROUND WITH A WHACK AND WAS POUNCED UPON AND HELD
lbi-6841-88291-0036 HE WOULD CATCH HIMSELF ON ONE FOOT SCRAMBLE VIGOROUSLY AND END BY STRUGGLING BACK TO THE UPRIGHT
lbi-6841-88291-0037 YOU CAN IMAGINE WHAT HAPPENED NEXT
lbi-6841-88291-0038 THIS IS PRODUCTIVE OF SOME FUN IF IT FAILS
lbi-6841-88291-0039 BY NOW THE BRANDING WAS IN FULL SWING
lbi-6841-88291-0040 WHEN THE NOOSES FELL THEY TURNED AND WALKED TOWARD THE FIRE AS A MATTER OF COURSE RARELY DID THE CAST FAIL
lbi-6841-88291-0041 MEN RAN TO AND FRO BUSY AND INTENT
lbi-6841-88291-0042 SOMETIMES THREE OR FOUR CALVES WERE ON THE GROUND AT ONCE
lbi-6841-88291-0043 DUST EDDIED AND DISSIPATED
lbi-6841-88291-0044 NO MORE NECKED CALVES THEY ANNOUNCED
lbi-6841-88291-0045 THEN HE WOULD SPIT ON HIS HANDS AND GO AT IT ALONE
lbi-6841-88291-0046 IF LUCK ATTENDED HIS FIRST EFFORT HIS SARCASM WAS PROFOUND THERE'S YORE LITTLE CALF SAID HE
lbi-6841-88291-0047 WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE ME TOTE IT TO YOU OR DO YOU RECKON YOU COULD TODDLE THIS FAR WITH YORE LITTLE OLD IRON
lbi-6841-88291-0048 TOWARD NOON THE WORK SLACKED
lbi-6841-88291-0049 FINALLY HOMER RODE OVER TO THE CATTLEMAN AND REPORTED THE BRANDING FINISHED
lbi-6841-88291-0050 THE LATTER COUNTED THE MARKS IN HIS TALLY BOOK
lbi-6841-88291-0051 ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX HE ANNOUNCED
lbi-6841-88291-0052 THE MARKERS SQUATTED ON THEIR HEELS TOLD OVER THE BITS OF EARS THEY HAD SAVED
lbi-6841-88291-0053 THE TOTAL AMOUNTED TO BUT AN HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE
lbi-6841-88291-0054 FINALLY WOODEN DISCOVERED IT IN HIS HIP POCKET
lbi-6841-88291-0055 THEY HAD BEEN DOING A WRESTLER'S HEAVY WORK ALL THE MORNING BUT DID NOT SEEM TO BE TIRED
lbi-6841-88291-0056 I SAW ONCE IN SOME CRANK PHYSICAL CULTURE PERIODICAL THAT A COWBOY'S LIFE WAS PHYSICALLY ILL BALANCED LIKE AN OARSMAN'S IN THAT IT EXERCISED ONLY CERTAIN MUSCLES OF THE BODY
lbi-6841-88294-0000 AT THIS MOMENT THE HEAVY BEAT OF THE STORM ON THE ROOF CEASED WITH MIRACULOUS SUDDENNESS LEAVING THE OUTSIDE WORLD EMPTY OF SOUND SAVE FOR THE DRIP DRIP DRIP OF EAVES
lbi-6841-88294-0001 WE HAD EVERY SORT OF PEOPLE WITH US OFF AND ON AND AS I WAS LOOKOUT AT A POPULAR GAME I SAW THEM ALL
lbi-6841-88294-0002 AT THE SAME INSTANT I HEARD THE RIP OF STEEL THROUGH CLOTH AND FELT A SHARP STAB IN MY LEFT LEG
lbi-6841-88294-0003 THEN I SCOUTED TO SEE WHAT HAD CUT ME AND FOUND THAT THE FELLOW HAD LOST A HAND
lbi-6841-88294-0004 IN PLACE OF IT HE WORE A SHARP STEEL HOOK
lbi-6841-88294-0005 THERE WAS NO DOUBT OF HIS BEING ALIVE FOR HE WAS BREATHING HARD LIKE A MAN DOES WHEN HE GETS HIT OVER THE HEAD IT DIDN'T SOUND GOOD
lbi-6841-88294-0006 WHEN A MAN BREATHES THAT WAY HE'S MOSTLY ALL GONE
lbi-6841-88294-0007 MEN GOT BATTED OVER THE HEAD OFTEN ENOUGH IN THOSE DAYS
lbi-6841-88294-0008 SOUR WINE IS FINE TO PUT A WOUND IN SHAPE TO HEAL BUT IT'S NO SOOTHING SYRUP
lbi-6841-88294-0009 THEIR COFFIN WAS THEIR SHIP AND THEIR GRAVE IT WAS THE SEA BLOW HIGH BLOW LOW WHAT CARE WE AND THE QUARTER THAT WE GAVE THEM WAS TO SINK THEM IN THE SEA DOWN ON THE COAST OF THE HIGH BARBAREE
lbi-6841-88294-0010 IT FAIR MADE MY HAIR RISE TO HEAR HIM WITH THE BIG STILL SOLEMN DESERT OUTSIDE AND THE QUIET MOONLIGHT AND THE SHADOWS AND HIM SITTING UP STRAIGHT AND GAUNT HIS EYES BLAZING EACH SIDE HIS BIG EAGLE NOSE AND HIS SNAKY HAIR HANGING OVER THE RAW CUT ACROSS HIS HEAD
lbi-6841-88294-0011 HOWEVER I MADE OUT TO GET HIM BANDAGED UP AND IN SHAPE AND PRETTY SOON HE SORT OF WENT TO SLEEP
lbi-6841-88294-0012 THEN AGAIN HE'D SING THAT BARBAREE SONG UNTIL I'D GO OUT AND LOOK AT THE OLD COLORADO FLOWING BY JUST TO BE SURE I HADN'T DIED AND GONE BELOW OR ELSE HE'D JUST TALK
lbi-6841-88294-0013 HE BEGAN WHEN HE WAS A KID AND HE GAVE HIS SIDE OF CONVERSATIONS PAUSING FOR REPLIES
lbi-6841-88294-0014 I USED TO LISTEN BY THE HOUR BUT I NEVER MADE OUT ANYTHING REALLY IMPORTANT AS TO WHO THE MAN WAS OR WHERE HE'D COME FROM OR WHAT HE'D DONE
lbi-6841-88294-0015 I DIDN'T PAY ANY ATTENTION TO HIM FOR HE WAS QUIET
lbi-6841-88294-0016 USUALLY I DIDN'T BOTHER WITH HIS TALK FOR IT DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING BUT SOMETHING IN HIS VOICE MADE ME TURN
lbi-6841-88294-0017 HE WAS LYING ON HIS SIDE THOSE BLACK EYES OF HIS BLAZING AT ME BUT NOW BOTH OF THEM SAW THE SAME DISTANCE
lbi-6841-88294-0018 WHERE ARE MY CLOTHES HE ASKED VERY INTENSE
lbi-6841-88294-0019 ONE LITTLE SQUEEZE TALK ABOUT YOUR DEADLY WEAPONS
lbi-6841-88294-0020 BUT HE'D BEEN TOO SICK AND TOO LONG ABED
lbi-6841-88294-0021 IN A MINUTE OR SO HE CAME TO
lbi-6841-88294-0022 NOW YOU'RE A NICE SWEET PROPOSITION SAID I AS SOON AS I WAS SURE HE COULD UNDERSTAND ME
lbi-6841-88294-0023 THEY'RE SAFE ENOUGH LET ME HAVE THEM HE BEGGED
lbi-6841-88294-0024 NOW LOOK HERE SAID I YOU CAN'T GET UP TO DAY YOU AIN'T FIT
lbi-6841-88294-0025 I KNOW HE PLEADED BUT LET ME SEE THEM
lbi-6841-88294-0026 JUST TO SATISFY HIM I PASSED OVER HIS OLD DUDS
lbi-6841-88294-0027 I'VE BEEN ROBBED HE CRIED
lbi-6841-88294-0028 WHERE'S MY COAT HE ASKED
lbi-6841-88294-0029 YOU HAD NO COAT WHEN I PICKED YOU UP I REPLIED
lbi-6841-88294-0030 HE LOOKED AT ME MIGHTY SUSPICIOUS BUT DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING MORE HE WOULDN'T EVEN ANSWER WHEN I SPOKE TO HIM
lbi-6841-88294-0031 AFTER HE'D EATEN A FAIR MEAL HE FELL ASLEEP
lbi-6841-88294-0032 WHEN I CAME BACK THAT EVENING THE BUNK WAS EMPTY AND HE WAS GONE
lbi-6841-88294-0033 I DIDN'T SEE HIM AGAIN FOR TWO DAYS
lbi-6841-88294-0034 THEN I CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM QUITE A WAYS OFF
lbi-6841-88294-0035 GUESS HE SUSPICIONS I STOLE THAT OLD COAT OF HIS THINKS I AND AFTERWARDS I FOUND THAT MY SURMISE HAD BEEN CORRECT
lbi-6841-88294-0036 HOWEVER HE DIDN'T STAY LONG IN THAT FRAME OF MIND
lbi-6841-88294-0037 I RAN UP PULLING MY GUN
lbi-6841-88294-0038 THE MEX WAS FLAT ON HIS FACE HIS ARMS STRETCHED OUT
lbi-6841-88294-0039 ON THE MIDDLE OF HIS BACK KNELT MY ONE ARMED FRIEND
lbi-6841-88294-0040 ANYWAY I THRUST THE MUZZLE OF MY COLT'S INTO THE SAILOR'S FACE WHAT'S THIS I ASKED
lbi-6841-88294-0041 I WEEN HEEM AT MONTE OFF ANTONIO CURVEZ SAID HE
lbi-6841-88294-0042 THE GLEAM DIED FROM HIS EYE THE SNARL LEFT HIS LIPS
lbi-6841-88294-0043 IN ANY CASE HE FLEW POCO PRONTO LEAVING ME AND MY FRIEND TOGETHER
lbi-6841-88294-0044 DURING THE NEXT TWO MONTHS HE WAS A GOOD DEAL ABOUT TOWN MOSTLY DOING ODD JOBS I SAW HIM OFF AND ON
lbi-6841-88294-0045 HOWEVER I DIDN'T PAY MUCH ATTENTION TO THAT BEING AT THE TIME ALMIGHTY BUSY HOLDING DOWN MY CARD GAMES
lbi-6841-88294-0046 THAT'S ALL RIGHT SAID I BUT YOU BETTER STAY RIGHT THERE
lbi-6841-88294-0047 I WANT TO MAKE UP TO YOU FOR YOUR TROUBLE SAID HE
lbi-6841-88294-0048 WHAT KIND OF A GOOD THING I ASKED TREASURE SAID HE
lbi-6841-88294-0049 HE LOOKED ALL RIGHT ENOUGH NEITHER DRUNK NOR LOCO
lbi-6841-88294-0050 SIT DOWN SAID I OVER THERE THE OTHER SIDE THE TABLE
lbi-6841-88294-0051 HE DID SO NOW FIRE AWAY SAID I
lbi-6841-88294-0052 AND IT'S A BIG THING SAID HANDY SOLOMON TO ME FOR THEY'S NOT ONLY GOLD BUT ALTAR JEWELS AND DIAMONDS
lbi-6841-88294-0053 IT WILL MAKE US RICH AND A DOZEN LIKE US AND YOU CAN KISS THE BOOK ON THAT
lbi-6841-88294-0054 THAT MAY ALL BE TRUE SAID I BUT WHY DO YOU TELL ME
lbi-6841-88294-0055 WHY DON'T YOU GET YOUR TREASURE WITHOUT THE NEED OF DIVIDING IT
lbi-6841-88294-0056 WHY MATE HE ANSWERED IT'S JUST PLAIN GRATITUDE
lbi-6841-88294-0057 DIDN'T YOU SAVE MY LIFE AND NUSS ME AND TAKE CARE OF ME WHEN I WAS NIGH KILLED
lbi-6841-88294-0058 LOOK HERE ANDERSON OR HANDY SOLOMON OR WHATEVER YOU PLEASE TO CALL YOURSELF I REJOINED TO THIS IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO BUSINESS WITH ME AND I DO NOT UNDERSTAND YET JUST WHAT IT IS YOU WANT OF ME YOU'LL HAVE TO TALK STRAIGHT
lbi-6841-88294-0059 IT'S ALL VERY WELL TO SAY GRATITUDE BUT THAT DON'T GO WITH ME
lbi-6841-88294-0060 THE DEVIL'S A PREACHER IF YOU AIN'T LOST YOUR PINFEATHERS SAID HE
lbi-6841-88294-0061 WELL IT'S THIS THEN I GOT TO HAVE A BOAT TO GET THERE AND SHE MUST BE STOCKED
lbi-6841-88294-0062 AND I GOT TO HAVE HELP WITH THE TREASURE IF IT'S LIKE THIS FELLOW SAID IT WAS
lbi-6841-88294-0063 IT'S MONEY I GOT TO HAVE AND IT'S MONEY I HAVEN'T GOT AND CAN'T GET UNLESS I LET SOMEBODY IN AS PARDNER
lbi-6841-88294-0064 WHY ME I ASKED WHY NOT HE RETORTED
lbi-6841-88294-0065 WE TALKED THE MATTER OVER AT LENGTH
lbi-6841-88294-0066 I STOOD OUT FOR A LARGER PARTY
lbi-6841-88294-0067 HE STRONGLY OPPOSED THIS AS DEPRECIATING THE SHARES BUT I HAD NO INTENTION OF GOING ALONE INTO WHAT WAS THEN CONSIDERED A WILD AND DANGEROUS COUNTRY FINALLY WE COMPROMISED
lbi-6841-88294-0068 A THIRD OF THE TREASURE WAS TO GO TO HIM A THIRD TO ME AND THE REST WAS TO BE DIVIDED AMONG THE MEN WHOM I SHOULD SELECT THIS SCHEME DID NOT APPEAL TO HIM
lbi-700-122866-0000 JUNIOR AVONLEA FOUND IT HARD TO SETTLE DOWN TO HUMDRUM EXISTENCE AGAIN
lbi-700-122866-0001 PERHAPS AFTER A WHILE I'LL GET USED TO IT BUT I'M AFRAID CONCERTS SPOIL PEOPLE FOR EVERYDAY LIFE
lbi-700-122866-0002 I SUPPOSE THAT IS WHY MARILLA DISAPPROVES OF THEM
lbi-700-122866-0003 I FEEL JUST NOW THAT I MAY GROW UP TO BE SENSIBLE YET
lbi-700-122866-0004 I JUST LAY AWAKE AND IMAGINED THE CONCERT OVER AND OVER AGAIN
lbi-700-122866-0005 EVENTUALLY HOWEVER AVONLEA SCHOOL SLIPPED BACK INTO ITS OLD GROOVE AND TOOK UP ITS OLD INTERESTS
lbi-700-122866-0006 NONE OF THE SLOANES WOULD HAVE ANY DEALINGS WITH THE BELLS BECAUSE THE BELLS HAD DECLARED THAT THE SLOANES HAD TOO MUCH TO DO IN THE PROGRAM AND THE SLOANES HAD RETORTED THAT THE BELLS WERE NOT CAPABLE OF DOING THE LITTLE THEY HAD TO DO PROPERLY
lbi-700-122866-0007 THE WINTER WEEKS SLIPPED BY
lbi-700-122866-0008 ON ANNE'S BIRTHDAY THEY WERE TRIPPING LIGHTLY DOWN IT KEEPING EYES AND EARS ALERT AMID ALL THEIR CHATTER FOR MISS STACY HAD TOLD THEM THAT THEY MUST SOON WRITE A COMPOSITION ON A WINTER'S WALK IN THE WOODS AND IT BEHOOVED THEM TO BE OBSERVANT
lbi-700-122866-0009 I CAN SCARCELY REALIZE THAT I'M IN MY TEENS
lbi-700-122866-0010 IT'S A GREAT COMFORT TO THINK THAT I'LL BE ABLE TO USE BIG WORDS THEN WITHOUT BEING LAUGHED AT
lbi-700-122866-0011 RUBY GILLIS THINKS OF NOTHING BUT BEAUS SAID ANNE DISDAINFULLY
lbi-700-122866-0012 SHE'S ACTUALLY DELIGHTED WHEN ANYONE WRITES HER NAME UP IN A TAKE NOTICE FOR ALL SHE PRETENDS TO BE SO MAD
lbi-700-122866-0013 I'M TRYING TO BE AS MUCH LIKE MISSUS ALLAN AS I POSSIBLY CAN FOR I THINK SHE'S PERFECT
lbi-700-122866-0014 IF I HAD ALICE BELL'S CROOKED NOSE SAID ANNE DECIDEDLY I WOULDN'T BUT THERE
lbi-700-122866-0015 I'M AFRAID I THINK TOO MUCH ABOUT MY NOSE EVER SINCE I HEARD THAT COMPLIMENT ABOUT IT LONG AGO
lbi-700-122866-0016 OH DIANA LOOK THERE'S A RABBIT
lbi-700-122866-0017 THEY'RE SO WHITE AND STILL AS IF THEY WERE ASLEEP AND DREAMING PRETTY DREAMS
lbi-700-122866-0018 I WROTE IT LAST MONDAY EVENING
lbi-700-122866-0019 IT'S CALLED THE JEALOUS RIVAL OR IN DEATH NOT DIVIDED
lbi-700-122866-0020 I READ IT TO MARILLA AND SHE SAID IT WAS STUFF AND NONSENSE
lbi-700-122866-0021 IT'S A SAD SWEET STORY
lbi-700-122866-0022 CORDELIA WAS A REGAL BRUNETTE WITH A CORONET OF MIDNIGHT HAIR AND DUSKLY FLASHING EYES
lbi-700-122866-0023 YOU KNOW SO MUCH MORE THAN YOU DID WHEN YOU WERE ONLY TWELVE
lbi-700-122866-0024 THEY GREW IN BEAUTY SIDE BY SIDE UNTIL THEY WERE SIXTEEN
lbi-700-122866-0025 I ASKED RUBY GILLIS IF SHE KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT HOW MEN PROPOSED BECAUSE I THOUGHT SHE'D LIKELY BE AN AUTHORITY ON THE SUBJECT HAVING SO MANY SISTERS MARRIED
lbi-700-122866-0026 BUT SHE PRETENDED TO BE GERALDINE'S FRIEND THE SAME AS EVER
lbi-700-122866-0027 LET YOU AND ME HAVE A STORY CLUB ALL OUR OWN AND WRITE STORIES FOR PRACTICE
lbi-700-122866-0028 YOU OUGHT TO CULTIVATE YOUR IMAGINATION YOU KNOW MISS STACY SAYS SO
lbi-700-122866-0029 ONLY WE MUST TAKE THE RIGHT WAY
lbi-700-122866-0030 THIS WAS HOW THE STORY CLUB CAME INTO EXISTENCE
lbi-700-122866-0031 NO BOYS WERE ALLOWED IN IT ALTHOUGH RUBY GILLIS OPINED THAT THEIR ADMISSION WOULD MAKE IT MORE EXCITING AND EACH MEMBER HAD TO PRODUCE ONE STORY A WEEK
lbi-700-122866-0032 EACH GIRL HAS TO READ HER STORY OUT LOUD AND THEN WE TALK IT OVER
lbi-700-122866-0033 MINE IS ROSAMOND MONTMORENCY ALL THE GIRLS DO PRETTY WELL
lbi-700-122866-0034 I'M SURE THAT MUST HAVE A WHOLESOME EFFECT
lbi-700-122866-0035 THE MORAL IS THE GREAT THING MISTER ALLAN SAYS SO
lbi-700-122866-0036 I READ ONE OF MY STORIES TO HIM AND MISSUS ALLAN AND THEY BOTH AGREED THAT THE MORAL WAS EXCELLENT
lbi-700-122866-0037 JANE AND RUBY ALMOST ALWAYS CRY WHEN I COME TO THE PATHETIC PARTS
lbi-700-122866-0038 MISS JOSEPHINE BARRY WROTE BACK THAT SHE HAD NEVER READ ANYTHING SO AMUSING IN HER LIFE
lbi-700-122866-0039 I'M SURE MISSUS ALLAN WAS NEVER SUCH A SILLY FORGETFUL LITTLE GIRL AS YOU ARE
lbi-700-122866-0040 I FELT SO ENCOURAGED WHEN I HEARD THAT
lbi-700-122866-0041 MISSUS LYNDE SAYS SHE ALWAYS FEELS SHOCKED WHEN SHE HEARS OF ANYONE EVER HAVING BEEN NAUGHTY NO MATTER HOW SMALL THEY WERE
lbi-700-122866-0042 NOW I WOULDN'T HAVE FELT THAT WAY
lbi-700-122867-0000 VANITY AND VEXATION OF SPIRIT
lbi-700-122867-0001 THE SPRING WAS ABROAD IN THE LAND AND MARILLA'S SOBER MIDDLE AGED STEP WAS LIGHTER AND SWIFTER BECAUSE OF ITS DEEP PRIMAL GLADNESS
lbi-700-122867-0002 I MUST SAY WITH ALL HER FAULTS I NEVER FOUND HER DISOBEDIENT OR UNTRUSTWORTHY BEFORE AND I'M REAL SORRY TO FIND HER SO NOW
lbi-700-122867-0003 PERHAPS YOU'RE JUDGING HER TOO HASTY MARILLA
lbi-700-122867-0004 OF COURSE I KNEW YOU'D TAKE HER PART MATTHEW BUT I'M BRINGING HER UP NOT YOU
lbi-700-122867-0005 DEMANDED MARILLA ANXIOUSLY GOING OVER TO THE BED
lbi-700-122867-0006 ANNE COWERED DEEPER INTO HER PILLOWS AS IF DESIROUS OF HIDING HERSELF FOREVER FROM MORTAL EYES NO
lbi-700-122867-0007 GET RIGHT UP THIS MINUTE AND TELL ME
lbi-700-122867-0008 THIS MINUTE I SAY THERE NOW WHAT IS IT
lbi-700-122867-0009 ANNE HAD SLID TO THE FLOOR IN DESPAIRING OBEDIENCE
lbi-700-122867-0010 YES IT'S GREEN MOANED ANNE
lbi-700-122867-0011 I THOUGHT NOTHING COULD BE AS BAD AS RED HAIR
lbi-700-122867-0012 YOU HAVEN'T GOT INTO ANY SCRAPE FOR OVER TWO MONTHS AND I WAS SURE ANOTHER ONE WAS DUE
lbi-700-122867-0013 NOW THEN WHAT DID YOU DO TO YOUR HAIR
lbi-700-122867-0014 ANNE SHIRLEY DIDN'T YOU KNOW IT WAS A WICKED THING TO DO
lbi-700-122867-0015 YES I KNEW IT WAS A LITTLE WICKED ADMITTED ANNE
lbi-700-122867-0016 I KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO HAVE YOUR WORD DOUBTED
lbi-700-122867-0017 AND MISSUS ALLAN SAYS WE SHOULD NEVER SUSPECT ANYONE OF NOT TELLING US THE TRUTH UNLESS WE HAVE PROOF THAT THEY'RE NOT
lbi-700-122867-0018 BUT I HADN'T THEN AND I BELIEVED EVERY WORD HE SAID IMPLICITLY
lbi-700-122867-0019 WHO SAID WHO ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
lbi-700-122867-0020 OH I DIDN'T LET HIM IN THE HOUSE
lbi-700-122867-0021 IN A TRICE I SAW MYSELF WITH BEAUTIFUL RAVEN BLACK HAIR AND THE TEMPTATION WAS IRRESISTIBLE
lbi-700-122867-0022 OH MARILLA WHAT A TANGLED WEB WE WEAVE WHEN FIRST WE PRACTICE TO DECEIVE
lbi-700-122867-0023 YOUR HAIR MUST BE CUT OFF THERE IS NO OTHER WAY YOU CAN'T GO OUT WITH IT LOOKING LIKE THAT
lbi-700-122867-0024 WITH A DISMAL SIGH SHE WENT FOR THE SCISSORS
lbi-700-122867-0025 BUT THERE IS NOTHING COMFORTING IN HAVING YOUR HAIR CUT OFF BECAUSE YOU'VE DYED IT A DREADFUL COLOR IS THERE
lbi-700-122867-0026 I'M GOING TO WEEP ALL THE TIME YOU'RE CUTTING IT OFF IF IT WON'T INTERFERE
lbi-700-122867-0027 IT SEEMS SUCH A TRAGIC THING
lbi-700-122867-0028 ANNE WEPT THEN BUT LATER ON WHEN SHE WENT UPSTAIRS AND LOOKED IN THE GLASS SHE WAS CALM WITH DESPAIR
lbi-700-122867-0029 YES I WILL TOO
lbi-700-122867-0030 I NEVER THOUGHT I WAS VAIN ABOUT MY HAIR OF ALL THINGS BUT NOW I KNOW I WAS IN SPITE OF ITS BEING RED BECAUSE IT WAS SO LONG AND THICK AND CURLY
lbi-700-122867-0031 I EXPECT SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN TO MY NOSE NEXT
lbi-700-122867-0032 ANNE'S CLIPPED HEAD MADE A SENSATION IN SCHOOL ON THE FOLLOWING MONDAY BUT TO HER RELIEF NOBODY GUESSED THE REAL REASON FOR IT NOT EVEN JOSIE PYE WHO HOWEVER DID NOT FAIL TO INFORM ANNE THAT SHE LOOKED LIKE A PERFECT SCARECROW
lbi-700-122867-0033 IT'S HARD TO BE TOLD YOU LOOK LIKE A SCARECROW AND I WANTED TO SAY SOMETHING BACK BUT I DIDN'T
lbi-700-122867-0034 IT MAKES YOU FEEL VERY VIRTUOUS WHEN YOU FORGIVE PEOPLE DOESN'T IT
lbi-700-122867-0035 I MEAN TO DEVOTE ALL MY ENERGIES TO BEING GOOD AFTER THIS AND I SHALL NEVER TRY TO BE BEAUTIFUL AGAIN
lbi-700-122867-0036 OF COURSE IT'S BETTER TO BE GOOD
lbi-700-122867-0037 I DO REALLY WANT TO BE GOOD MARILLA LIKE YOU AND MISSUS ALLAN AND MISS STACY AND GROW UP TO BE A CREDIT TO YOU
lbi-700-122867-0038 DIANA SAYS WHEN MY HAIR BEGINS TO GROW TO TIE A BLACK VELVET RIBBON AROUND MY HEAD WITH A BOW AT ONE SIDE
lbi-700-122867-0039 I WILL CALL IT A SNOOD THAT SOUNDS SO ROMANTIC
lbi-700-122867-0040 MY HEAD IS BETTER NOW
lbi-700-122867-0041 IT WAS TERRIBLE BAD THIS AFTERNOON THOUGH
lbi-700-122868-0000 OF COURSE YOU MUST BE ELAINE ANNE SAID DIANA
lbi-700-122868-0001 OF COURSE IT WOULD BE ROMANTIC CONCEDED JANE ANDREWS BUT I KNOW I COULDN'T KEEP STILL
lbi-700-122868-0002 BUT IT'S SO RIDICULOUS TO HAVE A REDHEADED ELAINE MOURNED ANNE
lbi-700-122868-0003 AND ELAINE WAS THE LILY MAID
lbi-700-122868-0004 YOUR COMPLEXION IS JUST AS FAIR AS RUBY'S SAID DIANA EARNESTLY AND YOUR HAIR IS EVER SO MUCH DARKER THAN IT USED TO BE BEFORE YOU CUT IT
lbi-700-122868-0005 IT WAS SPLENDID TO FISH FOR TROUT OVER THE BRIDGE AND THE TWO GIRLS LEARNED TO ROW THEMSELVES ABOUT IN THE LITTLE FLAT BOTTOMED DORY MISTER BARRY KEPT FOR DUCK SHOOTING
lbi-700-122868-0006 IT WAS ANNE'S IDEA THAT THEY DRAMATIZE ELAINE
lbi-700-122868-0007 THOSE DAYS SHE SAID WERE SO MUCH MORE ROMANTIC THAN THE PRESENT
lbi-700-122868-0008 THEY HAD OFTEN GONE DOWN LIKE THIS AND NOTHING COULD BE MORE CONVENIENT FOR PLAYING ELAINE
lbi-700-122868-0009 THE BLACK SHAWL HAVING BEEN PROCURED ANNE SPREAD IT OVER THE FLAT AND THEN LAY DOWN ON THE BOTTOM WITH CLOSED EYES AND HANDS FOLDED OVER HER BREAST
lbi-700-122868-0010 IT SPOILS THE EFFECT BECAUSE THIS IS HUNDREDS OF YEARS BEFORE MISSUS LYNDE WAS BORN
lbi-700-122868-0011 JANE YOU ARRANGE THIS
lbi-700-122868-0012 IT'S SILLY FOR ELAINE TO BE TALKING WHEN SHE'S DEAD
lbi-700-122868-0013 JANE ROSE TO THE OCCASION
lbi-700-122868-0014 LEFT BEHIND AT THE LANDING
lbi-700-122868-0015 ANNE GAVE ONE GASPING LITTLE SCREAM WHICH NOBODY EVER HEARD SHE WAS WHITE TO THE LIPS BUT SHE DID NOT LOSE HER SELF POSSESSION
lbi-700-122868-0016 THERE WAS ONE CHANCE JUST ONE
lbi-700-122868-0017 UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES YOU DON'T THINK MUCH ABOUT MAKING A FLOWERY PRAYER
lbi-700-122868-0018 THE FLAT DRIFTED UNDER THE BRIDGE AND THEN PROMPTLY SANK IN MIDSTREAM
lbi-700-122868-0019 RUBY JANE AND DIANA ALREADY AWAITING IT ON THE LOWER HEADLAND SAW IT DISAPPEAR BEFORE THEIR VERY EYES AND HAD NOT A DOUBT BUT THAT ANNE HAD GONE DOWN WITH IT
lbi-700-122868-0020 THE MINUTES PASSED BY EACH SEEMING AN HOUR TO THE UNFORTUNATE LILY MAID
lbi-700-122868-0021 WHY DIDN'T SOMEBODY COME WHERE HAD THE GIRLS GONE
lbi-700-122868-0022 HER IMAGINATION BEGAN TO SUGGEST ALL MANNER OF GRUESOME POSSIBILITIES TO HER
lbi-700-122868-0023 ANNE SHIRLEY
lbi-700-122868-0024 HOW ON EARTH DID YOU GET THERE HE EXCLAIMED
lbi-700-122868-0025 IT WAS CERTAINLY EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO BE DIGNIFIED UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES
lbi-700-122868-0026 WHAT HAS HAPPENED ANNE
lbi-700-122868-0027 ASKED GILBERT TAKING UP HIS OARS
lbi-700-122868-0028 WE WERE PLAYING ELAINE EXPLAINED ANNE FRIGIDLY WITHOUT EVEN LOOKING AT HER RESCUER AND I HAD TO DRIFT DOWN TO CAMELOT IN THE BARGE I MEAN THE FLAT
lbi-700-122868-0029 FOR A MOMENT ANNE HESITATED
lbi-700-122868-0030 HER HEART GAVE A QUICK QUEER LITTLE BEAT
lbi-700-122868-0031 HER RESENTMENT WHICH TO OTHER AND OLDER PEOPLE MIGHT BE AS LAUGHABLE AS ITS CAUSE WAS IN NO WHIT ALLAYED AND SOFTENED BY TIME SEEMINGLY
lbi-700-122868-0032 NO SHE SAID COLDLY I SHALL NEVER BE FRIENDS WITH YOU GILBERT BLYTHE AND I DON'T WANT TO BE
lbi-700-122868-0033 ALL RIGHT
lbi-700-122868-0034 I'LL NEVER ASK YOU TO BE FRIENDS AGAIN ANNE SHIRLEY AND I DON'T CARE EITHER
lbi-700-122868-0035 OF COURSE HE HAD INSULTED HER TERRIBLY BUT STILL
lbi-700-122868-0036 EVERYTHING I DO GETS ME OR MY DEAREST FRIENDS INTO A SCRAPE
lbi-700-122868-0037 ANNE'S PRESENTIMENT PROVED MORE TRUSTWORTHY THAN PRESENTIMENTS ARE APT TO DO
lbi-700-122868-0038 WILL YOU EVER HAVE ANY SENSE ANNE GROANED MARILLA
lbi-700-122868-0039 I DON'T SEE HOW SAID MARILLA
lbi-700-122868-0040 EVER SINCE I CAME TO GREEN GABLES I'VE BEEN MAKING MISTAKES AND EACH MISTAKE HAS HELPED TO CURE ME OF SOME GREAT SHORTCOMING
lbi-7601-101619-0000 OUR EXTREMEST PLEASURE HAS SOME SORT OF GROANING AND COMPLAINING IN IT WOULD YOU NOT SAY THAT IT IS DYING OF PAIN
lbi-7601-101619-0001 THE HIGHEST AND FULLEST CONTENTMENT OFFERS MORE OF THE GRAVE THAN OF THE MERRY IPSA FELICITAS SE NISI TEMPERAT PREMIT EVEN FELICITY UNLESS IT MODERATE ITSELF OPPRESSES
lbi-7601-101619-0002 SOCRATES SAYS THAT SOME GOD TRIED TO MIX IN ONE MASS AND TO CONFOUND PAIN AND PLEASURE BUT NOT BEING ABLE TO DO IT HE BETHOUGHT HIM AT LEAST TO COUPLE THEM BY THE TAIL METRODORUS SAID THAT IN SORROW THERE IS SOME MIXTURE OF PLEASURE
lbi-7601-101619-0003 NATURE DISCOVERS THIS CONFUSION TO US PAINTERS HOLD THAT THE SAME MOTIONS AND GRIMACES OF THE FACE THAT SERVE FOR WEEPING SERVE FOR LAUGHTER TOO AND INDEED BEFORE THE ONE OR THE OTHER BE FINISHED DO BUT OBSERVE THE PAINTER'S MANNER OF HANDLING AND YOU WILL BE IN DOUBT TO WHICH OF THE TWO THE DESIGN TENDS AND THE EXTREME OF LAUGHTER DOES AT LAST BRING TEARS
lbi-7601-101619-0004 AND THEREFORE COMMON AND LESS SPECULATIVE SOULS ARE FOUND TO BE MORE PROPER FOR AND MORE SUCCESSFUL IN THE MANAGEMENT OF AFFAIRS AND THE ELEVATED AND EXQUISITE OPINIONS OF PHILOSOPHY UNFIT FOR BUSINESS THIS SHARP VIVACITY OF SOUL AND THE SUPPLE AND RESTLESS VOLUBILITY ATTENDING IT DISTURB OUR NEGOTIATIONS
lbi-7601-101619-0005 HE WHO DIVES INTO AND IN HIS INQUISITION COMPREHENDS ALL CIRCUMSTANCES AND CONSEQUENCES HINDERS HIS ELECTION A LITTLE ENGINE WELL HANDLED IS SUFFICIENT FOR EXECUTIONS WHETHER OF LESS OR GREATER WEIGHT
lbi-7601-101622-0000 THE ROMANS BY THIS MEANS ERECTED THEIR COLONIES FOR PERCEIVING THEIR CITY TO GROW IMMEASURABLY POPULOUS THEY EASED IT OF THE MOST UNNECESSARY PEOPLE AND SENT THEM TO INHABIT AND CULTIVATE THE LANDS CONQUERED BY THEM SOMETIMES ALSO THEY PURPOSELY MAINTAINED WARS WITH SOME OF THEIR ENEMIES NOT ONLY TO KEEP THEIR OWN MEN IN ACTION FOR FEAR LEST IDLENESS THE MOTHER OF CORRUPTION SHOULD BRING UPON THEM SOME WORSE INCONVENIENCE
lbi-7601-101622-0001 AND WE SUFFER THE ILLS OF A LONG PEACE LUXURY IS MORE PERNICIOUS THAN WAR
lbi-7601-101622-0002 AND THIS ALSO WAS ONE REASON WHY OUR KING PHILIP CONSENTED TO SEND HIS SON JOHN UPON A FOREIGN EXPEDITION THAT HE MIGHT TAKE ALONG WITH HIM A GREAT NUMBER OF HOT YOUNG MEN WHO WERE THEN IN HIS PAY
lbi-7601-101622-0003 WHAT OTHER END DOES THE IMPIOUS ART OF THE GLADIATORS PROPOSE TO ITSELF WHAT THE SLAUGHTER OF YOUNG MEN WHAT PLEASURE FED WITH BLOOD
lbi-7601-101622-0004 PRINCE TAKE THE HONOURS DELAYED FOR THY REIGN AND BE SUCCESSOR TO THY FATHERS HENCEFORTH LET NONE AT ROME BE SLAIN FOR SPORT
lbi-7601-101622-0005 LET BEASTS BLOOD STAIN THE INFAMOUS ARENA AND NO MORE HOMICIDES BE THERE ACTED
lbi-7601-101622-0006 IT WAS NOT ENOUGH FOR THEM TO FIGHT AND TO DIE BRAVELY BUT CHEERFULLY TOO INSOMUCH THAT THEY WERE HISSED AND CURSED IF THEY MADE ANY HESITATION ABOUT RECEIVING THEIR DEATH
lbi-7601-101622-0007 THE VERY GIRLS THEMSELVES SET THEM ON
lbi-7601-175351-0000 BEGINNING OF REVOLT
lbi-7601-175351-0001 AT THIS UNEXPECTED COMMAND THE SURPRISE WAS GREAT ON BOARD THE FORWARD
lbi-7601-175351-0002 LIGHT THE FIRES EXCLAIMED SOME
lbi-7601-175351-0003 WHAT WITH ASKED OTHERS
lbi-7601-175351-0004 AND STUFF THE STOVE WITH THE MASTS ADDED WARREN
lbi-7601-175351-0005 DID YOU HEAR ME
lbi-7601-175351-0006 WHO SPOKE CRIED HATTERAS
lbi-7601-175351-0007 I DID SAID PEN ADVANCING TOWARDS THE CAPTAIN
lbi-7601-175351-0008 I SAY ANSWERED PEN WITH AN OATH I SAY WE'VE HAD ENOUGH OF IT AND WE WON'T GO ANY FURTHER
lbi-7601-175351-0009 YOU SHAN'T KILL US WITH HUNGER AND WORK IN THE WINTER AND THEY SHAN'T LIGHT THE FIRES
lbi-7601-175351-0010 IF YOU REPEAT WHAT THE MAN SAYS ANSWERED HATTERAS I'LL HAVE YOU SHUT UP IN YOUR CABIN AND GUARDED
lbi-7601-175351-0011 A MURMUR WAS HEARD
lbi-7601-175351-0012 THE ENGINEER FOLLOWED BY PLOVER AND WARREN WENT DOWN TO HIS POST
lbi-7601-175351-0013 THE STEAM WAS SOON GOT UP THE ANCHORS WERE WEIGHED AND THE FORWARD VEERED AWAY EAST CUTTING THE YOUNG ICE WITH HER STEEL PROW
lbi-7601-175351-0014 BETWEEN BARING ISLAND AND BEECHER POINT THERE ARE A CONSIDERABLE QUANTITY OF ISLANDS IN THE MIDST OF ICE FIELDS THE STREAMS CROWD TOGETHER IN THE LITTLE CHANNELS WHICH CUT UP THIS PART OF THE SEA THEY HAD A TENDENCY TO AGGLOMERATE UNDER THE RELATIVELY LOW TEMPERATURE HUMMOCKS WERE FORMED HERE AND THERE AND THESE MASSES ALREADY MORE COMPACT DENSER AND CLOSER TOGETHER WOULD SOON FORM AN IMPENETRABLE MASS
lbi-7601-175351-0015 I AM BEGINNING NOT TO ANSWERED WALL
lbi-7601-175351-0016 HATTERAS STILL HOPED TO FIND AN OPEN SEA BEYOND THE SEVENTY SEVENTH PARALLEL AS SIR EDWARD BELCHER HAD DONE
lbi-7601-175351-0017 OUGHT HE TO TREAT THESE ACCOUNTS AS APOCRYPHAL
lbi-7601-175351-0018 THE NEXT DAY THE SUN SET FOR THE FIRST TIME ENDING THUS THE LONG SERIES OF DAYS WITH TWENTY FOUR HOURS IN THEM
lbi-7601-175351-0019 THE MEN HAD ENDED BY GETTING ACCUSTOMED TO THE CONTINUAL DAYLIGHT BUT IT HAD NEVER MADE ANY DIFFERENCE TO THE ANIMALS THE GREENLAND DOGS WENT TO THEIR REST AT THEIR ACCUSTOMED HOUR AND DICK SLEPT AS REGULARLY EVERY EVENING AS THOUGH DARKNESS HAD COVERED THE SKY
lbi-7601-175351-0020 THE DOCTOR BY FOLLOWING JOHNSON'S ADVICE ACCUSTOMED HIMSELF TO SUPPORT THE LOW TEMPERATURE HE ALMOST ALWAYS STAYED ON DECK BRAVING THE COLD THE WIND AND THE SNOW
lbi-7601-175351-0021 THERE'S MORE THAN ONE AMONGST US WHO WOULD LIKE TO IMITATE THEM I THINK
lbi-7601-175351-0022 THEY ARE COWARDS MISTER CLAWBONNY THOSE ANIMALS HAVE NO PROVISIONS AS WE HAVE AND ARE OBLIGED TO SEEK THEIR FOOD WHERE IT IS TO BE FOUND
lbi-7601-175351-0023 YOU HOPE THAT HATTERAS WILL SUCCEED THEN
lbi-7601-175351-0024 HE CERTAINLY WILL MISTER CLAWBONNY
lbi-7601-175351-0025 I AM OF THE SAME OPINION AS YOU JOHNSON AND IF HE ONLY WANTED ONE FAITHFUL COMPANION HE'LL HAVE TWO
lbi-7601-175351-0026 PRINCE ALBERT LAND WHICH THE FORWARD WAS THEN COASTING BEARS ALSO THE NAME OF GRINNELL LAND AND THOUGH HATTERAS FROM HIS HATRED TO THE YANKEES WOULD NEVER CALL IT BY ITS AMERICAN NAME IT IS THE ONE IT GENERALLY GOES BY
lbi-7601-175351-0027 ON THE EIGHTEENTH OF AUGUST THEY SIGHTED BRITANNIA MOUNTAIN SCARCELY VISIBLE THROUGH THE MIST AND THE FORWARD WEIGHED ANCHOR THE NEXT DAY IN NORTHUMBERLAND BAY
lbi-7601-291468-0000 WHEN THE LOFTY THUCYDIDES IS ABOUT TO ENTER UPON HIS DESCRIPTION OF THE PLAGUE THAT DESOLATED ATHENS ONE OF HIS MODERN COMMENTATORS ASSURES THE READER THAT THE HISTORY IS NOW GOING TO BE EXCEEDINGLY SOLEMN SERIOUS AND PATHETIC AND HINTS WITH THAT AIR OF CHUCKLING GRATULATION WITH WHICH A GOOD DAME DRAWS FORTH A CHOICE MORSEL FROM A CUPBOARD TO REGALE A FAVORITE THAT THIS PLAGUE WILL GIVE HIS HISTORY A MOST AGREEABLE VARIETY
lbi-7601-291468-0001 SUCH ARE THE TRUE SUBJECTS FOR THE HISTORIC PEN
lbi-7601-291468-0002 THE FALL OF EMPIRES THE DESOLATION OF HAPPY COUNTRIES SPLENDID CITIES SMOKING IN THEIR RUINS THE PROUDEST WORKS OF ART TUMBLED IN THE DUST THE SHRIEKS AND GROANS OF WHOLE NATIONS ASCENDING UNTO HEAVEN
lbi-7601-291468-0003 THUS THOSE SWARMS OF FLIES WHICH ARE SO OFTEN EXECRATED AS USELESS VERMIN ARE CREATED FOR THE SUSTENANCE OF SPIDERS AND SPIDERS ON THE OTHER HAND ARE EVIDENTLY MADE TO DEVOUR FLIES
lbi-7601-291468-0004 ANCIENT TRADITIONS SPEAK MUCH OF HIS LEARNING AND OF THE GALLANT INROADS HE HAD MADE INTO THE DEAD LANGUAGES IN WHICH HE HAD MADE CAPTIVE A HOST OF GREEK NOUNS AND LATIN VERBS AND BROUGHT OFF RICH BOOTY IN ANCIENT SAWS AND APOPHTHEGMS WHICH HE WAS WONT TO PARADE IN HIS PUBLIC HARANGUES AS A TRIUMPHANT GENERAL OF YORE HIS SPOLIA OPIMA
lbi-7601-291468-0005 IT WAS OBSERVED HOWEVER THAT HE SELDOM GOT INTO AN ARGUMENT WITHOUT GETTING INTO A PERPLEXITY AND THEN INTO A PASSION WITH HIS ADVERSARY FOR NOT BEING CONVINCED GRATIS
lbi-7601-291468-0006 HIS ABODE WHICH HE HAD FIXED AT A BOWERY OR COUNTRY SEAT AT A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE CITY JUST AT WHAT IS NOW CALLED DUTCH STREET SOON ABOUNDED WITH PROOFS OF HIS INGENUITY PATENT SMOKE JACKS THAT REQUIRED A HORSE TO WORK THEM DUTCH OVENS THAT ROASTED MEAT WITHOUT FIRE CARTS THAT WENT BEFORE THE HORSES WEATHERCOCKS THAT TURNED AGAINST THE WIND AND OTHER WRONG HEADED CONTRIVANCES THAT ASTONISHED AND CONFOUNDED ALL BEHOLDERS
lbi-7601-291468-0007 IT IS IN KNOWLEDGE AS IN SWIMMING HE WHO FLOUNDERS AND SPLASHES ON THE SURFACE MAKES MORE NOISE AND ATTRACTS MORE ATTENTION THAN THE PEARL DIVER WHO QUIETLY DIVES IN QUEST OF TREASURES TO THE BOTTOM
lbi-7641-96252-0000 THUS WHEN DOGMAS LEAD IT WHAT THE MAN REALLY AND IN GENERAL WILLS REMAINS STILL THE SAME
lbi-7641-96252-0001 FOR THESE ARE CAREFUL ONLY FOR THEMSELVES FOR THEIR OWN EGOISM JUST LIKE THE BANDIT FROM WHOM THEY ARE ONLY DISTINGUISHED BY THE ABSURDITY OF THEIR MEANS
lbi-7641-96252-0002 THE DEEDS AND CONDUCT OF AN INDIVIDUAL AND OF A NATION MAY BE VERY MUCH MODIFIED THROUGH DOGMAS EXAMPLE AND CUSTOM
lbi-7641-96252-0003 WITH AN EQUAL DEGREE OF WICKEDNESS ONE MAN MAY DIE ON THE WHEEL AND ANOTHER IN THE BOSOM OF HIS FAMILY
lbi-7641-96252-0004 IT IS CONCEIVABLE THAT A PERFECT STATE OR PERHAPS INDEED A COMPLETE AND FIRMLY BELIEVED DOCTRINE OF REWARDS AND PUNISHMENTS AFTER DEATH MIGHT PREVENT EVERY CRIME POLITICALLY MUCH WOULD BE GAINED THEREBY MORALLY NOTHING ONLY THE EXPRESSION OF THE WILL IN LIFE WOULD BE RESTRICTED
lbi-7641-96252-0005 WE WHO HERE SEEK THE THEORY OF VIRTUE AND HAVE THEREFORE ALSO TO EXPRESS ABSTRACTLY THE NATURE OF THE KNOWLEDGE WHICH LIES AT ITS FOUNDATION WILL YET BE UNABLE TO CONVEY THAT KNOWLEDGE ITSELF IN THIS EXPRESSION
lbi-7641-96252-0006 HE SEES THAT THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN HIMSELF AND OTHERS WHICH TO THE BAD MAN IS SO GREAT A GULF ONLY BELONGS TO A FLEETING AND ILLUSIVE PHENOMENON
lbi-7641-96252-0007 HE RECOGNISES HIMSELF HIS WILL IN EVERY BEING AND CONSEQUENTLY ALSO IN THE SUFFERER
lbi-7641-96252-0008 BUT THE LATTER IS THE NECESSARY AND INEVITABLE SYMPTOM OF THAT KNOWLEDGE
lbi-7641-96252-0009 THE OPPOSITE OF THE STING OF CONSCIENCE THE ORIGIN AND SIGNIFICANCE OF WHICH IS EXPLAINED ABOVE IS THE GOOD CONSCIENCE THE SATISFACTION WHICH WE EXPERIENCE AFTER EVERY DISINTERESTED DEED
lbi-7641-96252-0010 THE GOOD MAN LIVES IN A WORLD OF FRIENDLY INDIVIDUALS THE WELL BEING OF ANY OF WHOM HE REGARDS AS HIS OWN
lbi-7641-96252-0011 THEREFORE ALTHOUGH THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE LOT OF MANKIND GENERALLY DOES NOT MAKE HIS DISPOSITION A JOYFUL ONE YET THE PERMANENT KNOWLEDGE OF HIS OWN NATURE IN ALL LIVING BEINGS GIVES HIM A CERTAIN EVENNESS AND EVEN SERENITY OF DISPOSITION
lbi-7641-96252-0012 FOR THE INTEREST WHICH IS EXTENDED TO INNUMERABLE MANIFESTATIONS CANNOT CAUSE SUCH ANXIETY AS THAT WHICH IS CONCENTRATED UPON ONE
lbi-7641-96252-0013 THE ACCIDENTS WHICH CONCERN INDIVIDUALS COLLECTIVELY EQUALISE THEMSELVES WHILE THOSE WHICH HAPPEN TO THE PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL CONSTITUTE GOOD OR BAD FORTUNE
lbi-7641-96252-0014 THUS THOUGH OTHERS HAVE SET UP MORAL PRINCIPLES WHICH THEY GIVE OUT AS PRESCRIPTIONS FOR VIRTUE AND LAWS WHICH IT WAS NECESSARY TO FOLLOW I AS HAS ALREADY BEEN SAID CANNOT DO THIS BECAUSE I HAVE NO OUGHT OR LAW TO PRESCRIBE TO THE ETERNALLY FREE WILL
lbi-7641-96252-0015 FURTHER THAN THIS IT CANNOT GO FOR THERE EXISTS NO REASON FOR PREFERRING THE INDIVIDUALITY OF ANOTHER TO ITS OWN
lbi-7641-96252-0016 YET THE NUMBER OF OTHER INDIVIDUALS WHOSE WHOLE HAPPINESS OR LIFE IS IN DANGER MAY OUTWEIGH THE REGARD FOR ONE'S OWN PARTICULAR WELL BEING
lbi-7641-96252-0017 SO DIED SOCRATES AND GIORDANO BRUNO AND SO MANY A HERO OF THE TRUTH SUFFERED DEATH AT THE STAKE AT THE HANDS OF THE PRIESTS
lbi-7641-96252-0018 WEEPING IS ACCORDINGLY SYMPATHY WITH OUR OWN SELVES OR SYMPATHY DIRECTED BACK ON ITS SOURCE
lbi-7641-96252-0019 IT IS THEREFORE CONDITIONAL UPON THE CAPACITY FOR LOVE AND SYMPATHY AND ALSO UPON IMAGINATION
lbi-7641-96252-0020 WHEN WE ARE MOVED TO TEARS NOT THROUGH OUR OWN SUFFERING BUT THROUGH THAT OF ANOTHER THIS HAPPENS AS FOLLOWS
lbi-7641-96252-0021 EITHER WE VIVIDLY PUT OURSELVES IN THE PLACE OF THE SUFFERER BY IMAGINATION OR SEE IN HIS FATE THE LOT OF HUMANITY AS A WHOLE AND CONSEQUENTLY FIRST OF ALL OUR OWN LOT AND THUS IN A VERY ROUNDABOUT WAY IT IS YET ALWAYS ABOUT OURSELVES THAT WE WEEP SYMPATHY WITH OURSELVES WHICH WE FEEL THIS SEEMS TO BE THE PRINCIPAL REASON OF THE UNIVERSAL AND THUS NATURAL WEEPING IN THE CASE OF DEATH
lbi-7641-96252-0022 FIRST OF ALL HE CERTAINLY WEEPS FOR THE FATE OF THE DEAD BUT HE ALSO WEEPS WHEN AFTER LONG HEAVY AND INCURABLE SUFFERING DEATH WAS TO THIS MAN A WISHED FOR DELIVERANCE
lbi-7641-96670-0000 THEY WERE IN THE LAND THIS PEOPLE SAID BEFORE THE MOON HAD COME INTO THE SKY
lbi-7641-96670-0001 AND MANY OF THE MAGICIANS OF EGYPT WHO HAD COME WITH KING SESOSTRIS STAYED IN THAT CITY OF AEA AND THEY TAUGHT PEOPLE SPELLS THAT COULD STAY THE MOON IN HER GOING AND COMING IN HER RISING AND SETTING
lbi-7641-96670-0002 MEDEA TOO HIS WISE DAUGHTER KNEW THE SECRETS TAUGHT BY THOSE WHO COULD SWAY THE MOON
lbi-7641-96670-0003 FOR JASON WAS THE GRANDSON OF CRETHEUS AND CRETHEUS WAS THE BROTHER OF ATHAMAS THEIR GRANDFATHER
lbi-7641-96670-0004 JASON TOOK PELEUS AND TELAMON WITH HIM
lbi-7641-96670-0005 AS THEY CAME TO THE CITY A MIST FELL AND JASON AND HIS COMRADES WITH THE SONS OF PHRIXUS WENT THROUGH THE CITY WITHOUT BEING SEEN
lbi-7641-96670-0006 THE MIST LIFTED AND BEFORE THE HEROES WAS THE WONDER OF THE PALACE IN THE BRIGHT LIGHT OF THE MORNING
lbi-7641-96670-0007 ON EACH SIDE OF THE COURTYARD WERE THE PALACE BUILDINGS IN ONE KING A EETES LIVED WITH APSYRTUS HIS SON AND IN THE OTHER CHALCIOPE AND MEDEA LIVED WITH THEIR HANDMAIDENS
lbi-7641-96670-0008 AND THEN A DOVE FLEW TOWARD HER IT WAS BEING CHASED BY A HAWK AND MEDEA SAW THE HAWK'S EYES AND BEAK
lbi-7641-96670-0009 WE PULLED AWAY FROM THAT PLACE AND THEREAFTER WE WERE DRIVEN BY THE WINDS BACK TO THE MOUTH OF THE PHASIS
lbi-7641-96670-0010 WITH HIM THERE CAME THE MIGHTIEST OF THE HEROES OF GREECE
lbi-7641-96670-0011 ALREADY HE HAS HEARD OF YOUR BITTER FOES THE SAUROMATAE
lbi-7641-96670-0012 HE WITH HIS COMRADES WOULD SUBDUE THEM FOR YOU
lbi-7641-96670-0013 A EETES'S HEART WAS FILLED WITH WRATH AS HE LOOKED UPON THEM AND HIS EYES SHONE AS A LEOPARD'S EYES
lbi-7641-96670-0014 AND THEN SPEAKING TO THE KING IN A QUIET VOICE JASON SAID
lbi-7641-96670-0015 HIS HEART WAS DIVIDED AS TO WHETHER HE SHOULD SUMMON HIS ARMED MEN AND HAVE THEM SLAIN UPON THE SPOT OR WHETHER HE SHOULD PUT THEM INTO DANGER BY THE TRIAL HE WOULD MAKE OF THEM
lbi-7641-96670-0016 IT MAY BE THAT YE ARE TRULY OF THE SEED OF THE IMMORTALS
lbi-7641-96670-0017 AND IT MAY BE THAT I SHALL GIVE YOU THE GOLDEN FLEECE TO BEAR AWAY AFTER I HAVE MADE TRIAL OF YOU
lbi-7641-96670-0018 SHE ENTERED SOFTLY AND SHE STOOD AWAY FROM HER FATHER AND THE FOUR WHO WERE SPEAKING WITH HIM
lbi-7641-96670-0019 SHE HAD A DARK FACE THAT WAS MADE VERY STRANGE BY HER CROWN OF GOLDEN HAIR
lbi-7641-96670-0020 KNOW THAT ON THE PLAIN OF ARES YONDER I HAVE TWO FIRE BREATHING BULLS WITH FEET OF BRASS
lbi-7641-96670-0021 THEN I SOWED THE FURROWS NOT WITH THE SEED THAT DEMETER GIVES BUT WITH TEETH OF A DRAGON
lbi-7641-96670-0022 IF YOU CAN ACCOMPLISH THIS THAT I ACCOMPLISHED IN DAYS GONE BY I SHALL SUBMIT TO YOU AND GIVE YOU THE GOLDEN FLEECE
lbi-7641-96670-0023 BUT IF YOU CANNOT ACCOMPLISH WHAT I ONCE ACCOMPLISHED YOU SHALL GO FROM MY CITY EMPTY HANDED FOR IT IS NOT RIGHT THAT A BRAVE MAN SHOULD YIELD AUGHT TO ONE WHO CANNOT SHOW HIMSELF AS BRAVE
lbi-7641-96670-0024 THEN JASON UTTERLY CONFOUNDED CAST HIS EYES UPON THE GROUND
lbi-7641-96670-0025 I WILL DARE THIS CONTEST MONSTROUS AS IT IS
lbi-7641-96670-0026 AS HE SAID THIS HE SAW THE EYES OF MEDEA GROW WIDE AS WITH FEAR
lbi-7641-96670-0027 PHRONTIS AND MELAS WENT TO WHERE THEIR MOTHER WAS
lbi-7641-96684-0000 AND AS A MORTAL APOLLO SOUGHT TO EARN HIS BREAD AMONGST MEN
lbi-7641-96684-0001 AFTERWARD PEOPLE WONDERED AT ADMETUS'S EVER SMILING FACE AND EVER RADIANT BEING
lbi-7641-96684-0002 THAT WAS BEFORE ADMETUS SAILED ON THE ARGO WITH JASON AND THE COMPANIONS OF THE QUEST
lbi-7641-96684-0003 THEREAFTER ADMETUS HAVING THE LOVE OF ALCESTIS WAS EVEN MORE HAPPY THAN HE HAD BEEN BEFORE
lbi-7641-96684-0004 A RADIANT FIGURE IT WAS AND ADMETUS KNEW THAT THIS WAS APOLLO COME TO HIM AGAIN
lbi-7641-96684-0005 BUT APOLLO TURNED TO ADMETUS A FACE THAT WAS WITHOUT JOY
lbi-7641-96684-0006 WHAT YEARS OF HAPPINESS HAVE BEEN MINE O APOLLO THROUGH YOUR FRIENDSHIP FOR ME SAID ADMETUS
lbi-7641-96684-0007 BUT STILL APOLLO STOOD BEFORE HIM WITH A FACE THAT WAS WITHOUT JOY
lbi-7641-96684-0008 HE SPOKE AND HIS VOICE WAS NOT THAT CLEAR AND VIBRANT VOICE THAT HE HAD ONCE IN SPEAKING TO ADMETUS
lbi-7641-96684-0009 ADMETUS ADMETUS HE SAID IT IS FOR ME TO TELL YOU THAT YOU MAY NO MORE LOOK ON THE BLUE SKY NOR WALK UPON THE GREEN EARTH
lbi-7641-96684-0010 IT IS FOR ME TO TELL YOU THAT THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD WILL HAVE YOU COME TO HIM ADMETUS ADMETUS KNOW THAT EVEN NOW THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD IS SENDING DEATH FOR YOU
lbi-7641-96684-0011 IF ONE WILL GO WILLINGLY IN THY PLACE WITH DEATH THOU CANST STILL LIVE ON GO ADMETUS
lbi-7641-96684-0012 AND THEN HE CAME UPON AN ANCIENT WOMAN WHO SAT UPON STONES IN THE COURTYARD GRINDING CORN BETWEEN TWO STONES
lbi-7641-96684-0013 THERE SHE WAS SITTING AS HE HAD FIRST KNOWN HER WITH HER EYES BLEARED AND HER KNEES SHAKING AND WITH THE DUST OF THE COURTYARD AND THE HUSKS OF THE CORN IN HER MATTED HAIR
lbi-7641-96684-0014 HE WENT TO HER AND SPOKE TO HER AND HE ASKED HER TO TAKE THE PLACE OF THE KING AND GO WITH DEATH
lbi-7641-96684-0015 BUT WHEN SHE HEARD THE NAME OF DEATH HORROR CAME INTO THE FACE OF THE ANCIENT WOMAN AND SHE CRIED OUT THAT SHE WOULD NOT LET DEATH COME NEAR HER
lbi-7641-96684-0016 ADMETUS TOOK THE MAN'S SHRIVELED HAND AND HE ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD NOT TAKE THE KING'S PLACE AND GO WITH DEATH THAT WAS COMING FOR HIM
lbi-7641-96684-0017 THEN ADMETUS WENT INTO THE PALACE AND INTO THE CHAMBER WHERE HIS BED WAS AND HE LAY DOWN UPON THE BED AND HE LAMENTED THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO GO WITH DEATH THAT WAS COMING FOR HIM FROM THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD AND HE LAMENTED THAT NONE OF THE WRETCHED ONES AROUND THE PALACE WOULD TAKE HIS PLACE
lbi-7641-96684-0018 ONE SHOULD GO IN YOUR PLACE FOR YOU ARE THE KING AND HAVE MANY GREAT AFFAIRS TO ATTEND TO
lbi-7641-96684-0019 NOW THE FOOTSTEPS SEEMED TO STOP
lbi-7641-96684-0020 IT WAS NOT SO TERRIBLE FOR HIM AS BEFORE
lbi-7641-96684-0021 AND THE WORDS HE HAD SPOKEN HE WOULD HAVE TAKEN BACK THE WORDS THAT HAD BROUGHT HER CONSENT TO GO WITH DEATH IN HIS PLACE
lbi-7641-96684-0022 DEATH WOULD SOON BE HERE FOR HER
lbi-7641-96684-0023 NO NOT HERE FOR HE WOULD NOT HAVE DEATH COME INTO THE PALACE
lbi-7641-96684-0024 HE LIFTED ALCESTIS FROM THE BED AND HE CARRIED HER FROM THE PALACE
lbi-7641-96684-0025 NO MORE SPEECH CAME FROM HER
lbi-7641-96684-0026 AND AS FOR ADMETUS HE WENT WITHIN THE CHAMBER AND KNELT BESIDE THE BED ON WHICH ALCESTIS HAD LAIN AND THOUGHT OF HIS TERRIBLE LOSS
lbi-7641-96684-0027 TO WHAT GOD IS THAT SACRIFICE DUE
lbi-7641-96684-0028 AND THEN HERACLES FELT THAT ANOTHER LABOR WAS BEFORE HIM
lbi-7641-96684-0029 I HAVE DRAGGED UP FROM THE UNDERWORLD HE THOUGHT THE HOUND THAT GUARDS THOSE WHOM DEATH BRINGS DOWN INTO THE REALM OF THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD
lbi-7641-96684-0030 WHY SHOULD I NOT STRIVE WITH DEATH
lbi-7641-96684-0031 AND WHAT A NOBLE THING IT WOULD BE TO BRING BACK THIS FAITHFUL WOMAN TO HER HOUSE AND TO HER HUSBAND
lbi-7641-96684-0032 HE LEFT THE PALACE OF ADMETUS AND HE WENT TO THE TEMPLE OF THE GODS
lbi-7641-96684-0033 YOU ARE HELD BY ME DEATH AND YOU WILL NOT BE LET GO UNLESS YOU PROMISE TO GO FORTH FROM THIS TEMPLE WITHOUT BRINGING ONE WITH YOU
lbi-7641-96684-0034 AND DEATH KNOWING THAT HERACLES COULD HOLD HIM THERE AND THAT THE BUSINESS OF THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD WOULD BE LEFT UNDONE IF HE WERE HELD PROMISED THAT HE WOULD LEAVE THE TEMPLE WITHOUT BRINGING ONE WITH HIM
lbi-7641-96684-0035 SHE WAS VEILED AND ADMETUS COULD NOT SEE HER FEATURES
lbi-7641-96684-0036 HERE IS A WOMAN WHOM I AM BRINGING BACK TO HER HUSBAND I WON HER FROM AN ENEMY
lbi-7641-96684-0037 THIS I CANNOT DO SAID ADMETUS I HAVE HAD PANGS ENOUGH
lbi-7641-96684-0038 THEN ADMETUS RAISED THE VEIL OF THE WOMAN HE HAD TAKEN ACROSS THE THRESHOLD OF HIS HOUSE
lbi-7697-105815-0000 HE NOW WENT ON TILL HE CAME TO THE HOUSE AT THE DOOR OF WHICH HE WAS TO KNOCK THIS HE DID TWO OR THREE TIMES
lbi-7697-105815-0001 CHRISTIAN I HAVE COME TO SEE THE GOOD MAN OF THE HOUSE
lbi-7697-105815-0002 CHRISTIAN SIR I AM COME FROM THE CITY OF DESTRUCTION AND AM ON MY WAY TO MOUNT ZION
lbi-7697-105815-0003 I WAS TOLD BY THE MAN THAT STANDS AT THE GATE THAT IF I CAME HERE YOU WOULD SHOW ME GOOD THINGS THAT WOULD HELP ME
lbi-7697-105815-0004 HE STOOD AS IF HE WOULD PLEAD FOR MEN AND A CROWN OF GOLD HUNG NEAR HIS HEAD
lbi-7697-105815-0005 CHRISTIAN WHAT DOES THIS MEAN
lbi-7697-105815-0006 THEN HE TOOK HIM TO A LARGE ROOM THAT WAS FULL OF DUST FOR IT HAD NOT BEEN SWEPT AND INTERPRETER TOLD HIS MAN TO SWEEP IT
lbi-7697-105815-0007 CHRISTIAN WHAT MEANS THIS
lbi-7697-105815-0008 THEN YOU NEXT SAW THE MAID COME IN TO LAY THE DUST SO IS SIN MADE CLEAN AND LAID LOW BY FAITH IN THE BOOK
lbi-7697-105815-0009 JUST AS CHRISTIAN CAME UP TO THE CROSS HIS LOAD SLID FROM HIS BACK CLOSE TO THE MOUTH OF THE TOMB WHERE IT FELL IN AND I SAW IT NO MORE
lbi-7697-105815-0010 AS HE STOOD THUS AND WEPT LO THREE BRIGHT ONES CAME TO HIM AND ONE OF THEM SAID PEACE BE TO THEE THOU HAST GRACE FROM THY SINS
lbi-7697-105815-0011 CHRISTIAN GAVE THREE LEAPS FOR JOY AND SANG AS HE WENT AH WHAT A PLACE IS THIS BLEST CROSS BLEST TOMB
lbi-7697-105815-0012 HE WENT ON THUS TILL HE CAME TO A VALE WHERE HE SAW THREE MEN WHO WERE IN A SOUND SLEEP WITH CHAINS ON THEIR FEET
lbi-7697-105815-0013 CHRISTIAN SIRS WHENCE COME YOU AND WHERE DO YOU GO
lbi-7697-105815-0014 FORMALIST AND HYPOCRISY WE WERE BORN IN THE LAND OF VAIN GLORY AND ARE ON OUR WAY TO MOUNT ZION FOR PRAISE
lbi-7697-105815-0015 KNOW YOU NOT THAT HE THAT COMES NOT IN AT THE DOOR BUT CLIMBS UP TO GET IN THE SAME IS A THIEF
lbi-7697-105815-0016 THEY TOLD CHRISTIAN THAT HE HAD NO NEED FOR CARE ON THAT SCORE FOR LONG USE HAD MADE IT LAW AND THEY COULD PROVE THAT IT HAD BEEN SO FOR YEARS
lbi-7697-105815-0017 YES SAID THEY NO DOUBT OF IT
lbi-7697-105815-0018 AND IF WE GET IN THE ROAD AT ALL PRAY WHAT ARE THE ODDS
lbi-7697-105815-0019 IS NOT OUR CASE AS GOOD AS YOURS
lbi-7697-105815-0020 I SAW THEN THAT THEY ALL WENT ON TILL THEY CAME TO THE FOOT OF THE HILL OF DIFFICULTY WHERE THERE WAS A SPRING
lbi-7697-105815-0021 NOW WHEN CHRISTIAN GOT AS FAR AS THE SPRING OF LIFE HE DRANK OF IT AND THEN WENT UP THE HILL
lbi-7697-105815-0022 NOW HALF WAY UP WAS A CAVE MADE BY THE LORD OF THAT HILL THAT THOSE WHO CAME BY MIGHT REST THERE
lbi-7697-105815-0023 TIMOROUS SAID THAT ZION WAS THE HILL THEY MEANT TO CLIMB BUT THAT WHEN THEY HAD GOT HALF WAY THEY FOUND THAT THEY MET WITH MORE AND MORE RISK SO THAT GREAT FEAR CAME ON THEM AND ALL THEY COULD DO WAS TO TURN BACK
lbi-7697-105815-0024 YES SAID MISTRUST FOR JUST IN FRONT OF US THERE LAY TWO BEASTS OF PREY IN OUR PATH WE KNEW NOT IF THEY SLEPT OR NOT BUT WE THOUGHT THAT THEY WOULD FALL ON US AND TEAR OUR LIMBS
lbi-7697-105815-0025 YET HE THOUGHT ONCE MORE OF WHAT HE HAD HEARD FROM THE MEN AND THEN HE FELT IN HIS CLOAK FOR HIS SCROLL THAT HE MIGHT READ IT AND FIND SOME PEACE
lbi-7697-105815-0026 HE FELT FOR IT BUT FOUND IT NOT
lbi-7697-105815-0027 SO HE FELL DOWN ON HIS KNEES TO PRAY THAT GOD WOULD GIVE HIM GRACE FOR THIS ACT AND THEN WENT BACK TO LOOK FOR HIS SCROLL
lbi-7697-105815-0028 OH FOOL THAT I AM SAID HE TO SLEEP IN THE DAY TIME SO TO GIVE WAY TO THE FLESH AS TO USE FOR EASE THAT REST WHICH THE LORD OF THE HILL HAD MADE BUT FOR THE HELP OF THE SOUL
lbi-7697-105815-0029 SUCH WAS THE LOT OF THE JEWS FOR THEIR SIN THEY WERE SENT BACK BY THE WAY OF THE RED SEA AND I AM MADE TO TREAD THOSE STEPS WITH GRIEF WHICH I MIGHT HAVE TROD WITH JOY HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THIS SLEEP
lbi-7697-105815-0030 HOW FAR MIGHT I HAVE BEEN ON MY WAY BY THIS TIME
lbi-7697-105815-0031 NOW BY THIS TIME HE HAD COME TO THE VALE ONCE MORE WHERE FOR A SPELL HE SAT DOWN AND WEPT BUT AT LAST AS HE CAST A SAD GLANCE AT THE FOOT OF THE BENCH HE SAW HIS SCROLL WHICH HE CAUGHT UP WITH HASTE AND PUT IN HIS CLOAK
lbi-7697-105815-0032 WORDS ARE TOO WEAK TO TELL THE JOY OF CHRISTIAN WHEN HE HAD GOT BACK HIS SCROLL
lbi-7697-105815-0033 HE LAID IT UP IN THE BREAST OF HIS COAT AND GAVE THANKS TO GOD
lbi-7697-105815-0034 WITH WHAT A LIGHT STEP DID HE NOW CLIMB THE HILL
lbi-7697-105815-0035 AH THOUGHT HE THESE BEASTS RANGE IN THE NIGHT FOR THEIR PREY AND IF THEY SHOULD MEET WITH ME IN THE DARK HOW SHOULD I FLY FROM THEM
lbi-7697-105815-0036 THE NAME OF THE MAN WHO KEPT THE LODGE OF THAT HOUSE WAS WATCHFUL AND WHEN HE SAW THAT CHRISTIAN MADE A HALT AS IF HE WOULD GO BACK HE CAME OUT TO HIM AND SAID IS THY STRENGTH SO SMALL
lbi-7697-105815-0037 FEAR NOT THE TWO WILD BEASTS FOR THEY ARE BOUND BY CHAINS AND ARE PUT HERE TO TRY THE FAITH OF THOSE THAT HAVE IT AND TO FIND OUT THOSE THAT HAVE NONE
lbi-7697-105815-0038 KEEP IN THE MIDST OF THE PATH AND NO HARM SHALL COME TO THEE
lbi-7697-105815-0039 THEN I SAW IN MY DREAM THAT STILL HE WENT ON IN GREAT DREAD OF THE WILD BEASTS HE HEARD THEM ROAR YET THEY DID HIM NO HARM BUT WHEN HE HAD GONE BY THEM HE WENT ON WITH JOY TILL HE CAME AND STOOD IN FRONT OF THE LODGE WHERE WATCHFUL DWELT
lbi-7697-105815-0040 CHRISTIAN SIR WHAT HOUSE IS THIS MAY I REST HERE TO NIGHT
lbi-7697-105815-0041 WHEN WATCHFUL TOLD HER WHY CHRISTIAN HAD COME THERE SHE SAID WHAT IS YOUR NAME
lbi-7697-105815-0042 THEN CHRISTIAN BENT DOWN HIS HEAD AND WENT WITH THEM TO THE HOUSE
lbi-7697-105815-0043 PIETY COME GOOD CHRISTIAN SINCE OUR LOVE PROMPTS US TO TAKE YOU IN TO REST LET US TALK WITH YOU OF ALL THAT YOU HAVE SEEN ON YOUR WAY
lbi-7697-105815-0044 CHRISTIAN WITH A RIGHT GOOD WILL AND I AM GLAD THAT YOU SHOULD ASK IT OF ME
lbi-7697-105815-0045 PRUDENCE AND FIRST SAY WHAT IS IT THAT MAKES YOU WISH SO MUCH TO GO TO MOUNT ZION
lbi-7697-105815-0046 THERE THEY SAY IS NO DEATH AND THERE I SHALL DWELL WITH SUCH AS LOVE THE LORD
lbi-7697-105815-0047 CHARITY HAVE YOU A WIFE AND BABES CHRISTIAN YES I HAVE
lbi-7697-105815-0048 CHARITY AND WHY DID YOU NOT BRING THEM WITH YOU
lbi-7697-105815-0049 BUT THEY WOULD NOT COME WITH ME NOR HAVE ME LEAVE THEM
lbi-7697-105815-0050 THUS DID CHRISTIAN TALK WITH THESE FRIENDS TILL IT GREW DARK AND THEN HE TOOK HIS REST IN A LARGE ROOM THE NAME OF WHICH WAS PEACE THERE HE SLEPT TILL BREAK OF DAY AND THEN HE SANG A HYMN
lbi-7697-105815-0051 AND THEY BROUGHT OUT THE JAW BONE OF AN ASS WITH WHICH SAMSON DID SUCH GREAT FEATS AND THE SLING AND STONE WITH WHICH DAVID SLEW GOLIATH OF GATH
lbi-7697-105815-0052 WHAT IS THE NAME OF THIS LAND SAID CHRISTIAN
lbi-7697-105815-0053 THEN THEY TOLD HIM IT WAS IMMANUEL'S LAND
lbi-7697-105817-0000 MORE THAN THIS HE HATH BEEN HEARD TO RAIL ON YOU MY LORD WHO ARE NOW HIS JUDGE
lbi-7697-105817-0001 JUDGE THY JUST DOOM WOULD BE TO DIE ON THE SPOT STILL LET US HEAR WHAT THOU HAST TO SAY
lbi-7697-105817-0002 THEN THE JUDGE TO SUM UP THE CASE SPOKE THUS YOU SEE THIS MAN WHO HAS MADE SUCH A STIR IN OUR TOWN
lbi-7697-105817-0003 THUS WHILE ONE LOST HIS LIFE FOR THE TRUTH A NEW MAN ROSE FROM HIS DEATH TO TREAD THE SAME WAY WITH CHRISTIAN
lbi-7697-105817-0004 COME GOOD HOPEFUL SAID CHRISTIAN LET US WALK ON THE GRASS
lbi-7697-105817-0005 SO THEY SET OFF THROUGH THE FIELD
lbi-7697-105817-0006 HOPEFUL I HAD MY FEARS FROM THE FIRST AND SO GAVE YOU A HINT CHRISTIAN GOOD FRIEND I GRIEVE THAT I HAVE BROUGHT YOU OUT OF THE RIGHT PATH
lbi-7697-105817-0007 HOPEFUL SAY NO MORE NO DOUBT IT IS FOR OUR GOOD
lbi-7697-105817-0008 CHRISTIAN WE MUST NOT STAND THUS LET US TRY TO GO BACK
lbi-7697-105817-0009 THEN SAID GIANT DESPAIR YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO FORCE YOUR WAY IN HERE THE GROUND ON WHICH YOU LIE IS MINE
lbi-7697-105817-0010 THEY HAD NOT MUCH TO SAY AS THEY KNEW THAT THEY WERE IN FAULT
lbi-7697-105817-0011 AND BY THIS ACT WE KILL OUR SOULS AS WELL
lbi-7697-245712-0000 FOUR WHETHER IN THAT STATE MAN WOULD HAVE BEEN MASTER OVER MEN
lbi-7697-245712-0001 THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN HAD NO MASTERSHIP OF THE ANIMALS
lbi-7697-245712-0002 THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE BEFORE MAN HAD DISOBEYED NOTHING DISOBEYED HIM THAT WAS NATURALLY SUBJECT TO HIM
lbi-7697-245712-0003 SECONDLY THIS IS PROVED BY THE ORDER OF DIVINE PROVIDENCE WHICH ALWAYS GOVERNS INFERIOR THINGS BY THE SUPERIOR
lbi-7697-245712-0004 THIRDLY THIS IS PROVED FROM A PROPERTY OF MAN AND OF OTHER ANIMALS
lbi-7697-245712-0005 NOW WHATEVER IS PARTICIPATED IS SUBJECT TO WHAT IS ESSENTIAL AND UNIVERSAL
lbi-7697-245712-0006 THEREFORE THE SUBJECTION OF OTHER ANIMALS TO MAN IS PROVED TO BE NATURAL
lbi-7697-245712-0007 THEY WOULD NOT HOWEVER ON THIS ACCOUNT HAVE BEEN EXCEPTED FROM THE MASTERSHIP OF MAN AS NEITHER AT PRESENT ARE THEY FOR THAT REASON EXCEPTED FROM THE MASTERSHIP OF GOD WHOSE PROVIDENCE HAS ORDAINED ALL THIS
lbi-7697-245712-0008 THIS IS SIGNIFIED BY THE FACT THAT GOD LED THE ANIMALS TO MAN THAT HE MIGHT GIVE THEM NAMES EXPRESSIVE OF THEIR RESPECTIVE NATURES
lbi-7697-245712-0009 SO ALL ANIMALS WOULD HAVE OBEYED MAN OF THEIR OWN ACCORD AS IN THE PRESENT STATE SOME DOMESTIC ANIMALS OBEY HIM
lbi-7697-245712-0010 OBJECTION ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN WOULD NOT HAVE HAD MASTERSHIP OVER ALL OTHER CREATURES
lbi-7697-245712-0011 MUCH LESS THEREFORE WOULD IT HAVE OBEYED MAN IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE
lbi-7697-245712-0012 THEREFORE SINCE IT IS BY HIS REASON THAT MAN IS COMPETENT TO HAVE MASTERSHIP IT SEEMS THAT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN HAD NO DOMINION OVER PLANTS
lbi-7697-245712-0013 NOW IN MAN REASON HAS THE POSITION OF A MASTER AND NOT OF A SUBJECT
lbi-7697-245712-0014 I ANSWER THAT WE MUST NEEDS ADMIT THAT IN THE PRIMITIVE STATE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN SOME INEQUALITY AT LEAST AS REGARDS SEX BECAUSE GENERATION DEPENDS UPON DIVERSITY OF SEX AND LIKEWISE AS REGARDS AGE FOR SOME WOULD HAVE BEEN BORN OF OTHERS NOR WOULD SEXUAL UNION HAVE BEEN STERILE
lbi-7697-245712-0015 THERE MIGHT ALSO HAVE BEEN BODILY DISPARITY
lbi-7697-245712-0016 INEQUALITY MIGHT ALSO ARISE ON THE PART OF NATURE AS ABOVE DESCRIBED WITHOUT ANY DEFECT OF NATURE
lbi-7697-245712-0017 OBJECTION ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MASTER OVER MAN
lbi-7697-245712-0018 THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO MAN
lbi-7697-245712-0019 IN ANOTHER SENSE MASTERSHIP IS REFERRED IN A GENERAL SENSE TO ANY KIND OF SUBJECT AND IN THIS SENSE EVEN HE WHO HAS THE OFFICE OF GOVERNING AND DIRECTING FREE MEN CAN BE CALLED A MASTER
lbi-7697-245712-0020 SUCH A KIND OF MASTERSHIP WOULD HAVE EXISTED IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE BETWEEN MAN AND MAN FOR TWO REASONS
lbi-7697-245715-0000 BUT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO WEAKNESS OF OLD AGE
lbi-7697-245715-0001 ON THE CONTRARY EVERYTHING GENERATED IS FIRST IMPERFECT BUT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE CHILDREN WOULD HAVE BEEN BEGOTTEN BY GENERATION
lbi-7697-245715-0002 THEREFORE FROM THE FIRST THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPERFECT IN BODILY SIZE AND POWER
lbi-7697-245715-0003 THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE THERE WAS NO NEED FOR WOMEN TO BE BORN ON THE CONTRARY NATURE'S PROCESS IN GENERATION WOULD HAVE BEEN IN HARMONY WITH THE MANNER IN WHICH IT WAS ESTABLISHED BY GOD
lbi-8173-294714-0000 I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT MISTER VAN BRANDT IS IN PRISON FOR DEBT I SAID
lbi-8173-294714-0001 AND I SAW FOR MYSELF LAST NIGHT THAT HE HAD LEFT YOU HELPLESS
lbi-8173-294714-0002 HE LEFT ME THE LITTLE MONEY HE HAD WITH HIM WHEN HE WAS ARRESTED SHE REJOINED SADLY
lbi-8173-294714-0003 HIS CRUEL CREDITORS ARE MORE TO BLAME THAN HE IS FOR THE POVERTY THAT HAS FALLEN ON US
lbi-8173-294714-0004 EVEN THIS NEGATIVE DEFENSE OF VAN BRANDT STUNG ME TO THE QUICK I OUGHT TO HAVE SPOKEN MORE GUARDEDLY OF HIM I SAID BITTERLY
lbi-8173-294714-0005 I OUGHT TO HAVE REMEMBERED THAT A WOMAN CAN FORGIVE ALMOST ANY WRONG THAT A MAN CAN INFLICT ON HER WHEN HE IS THE MAN WHOM SHE LOVES
lbi-8173-294714-0006 SHE PUT HER HAND ON MY MOUTH AND STOPPED ME BEFORE I COULD SAY ANY MORE
lbi-8173-294714-0007 HOW CAN YOU SPEAK SO CRUELLY TO ME SHE ASKED
lbi-8173-294714-0008 YOU KNOW TO MY SHAME I CONFESSED IT TO YOU THE LAST TIME WE MET YOU KNOW THAT MY HEART IN SECRET IS ALL YOURS
lbi-8173-294714-0009 WHAT WRONG ARE YOU TALKING OF
lbi-8173-294714-0010 IS IT THE WRONG I SUFFERED WHEN VAN BRANDT MARRIED ME WITH A WIFE LIVING AT THE TIME AND LIVING STILL
lbi-8173-294714-0011 DO YOU THINK I CAN EVER FORGET THE GREAT MISFORTUNE OF MY LIFE THE MISFORTUNE THAT HAS MADE ME UNWORTHY OF YOU
lbi-8173-294714-0012 IT IS NO FAULT OF MINE GOD KNOWS BUT IT IS NOT THE LESS TRUE THAT I AM NOT MARRIED AND THAT THE LITTLE DARLING WHO IS PLAYING OUT THERE WITH HER DOLL IS MY CHILD
lbi-8173-294714-0013 AND YOU TALK OF MY BEING YOUR WIFE KNOWING THAT THE CHILD ACCEPTS ME AS HER SECOND FATHER I SAID
lbi-8173-294714-0014 IT WOULD BE BETTER AND HAPPIER FOR US BOTH IF YOU HAD AS LITTLE PRIDE AS THE CHILD PRIDE SHE REPEATED
lbi-8173-294714-0015 IN SUCH A POSITION AS MINE
lbi-8173-294714-0016 A HELPLESS WOMAN WITH A MOCK HUSBAND IN PRISON FOR DEBT
lbi-8173-294714-0017 AM I TO MARRY YOU FOR MY FOOD AND SHELTER
lbi-8173-294714-0018 AM I TO MARRY YOU BECAUSE THERE IS NO LAWFUL TIE THAT BINDS ME TO THE FATHER OF MY CHILD
lbi-8173-294714-0019 BAD AS HE IS HE HAS NOT FORSAKEN ME HE HAS BEEN FORCED AWAY
lbi-8173-294714-0020 MY ONLY FRIEND IS IT POSSIBLE THAT YOU THINK ME UNGRATEFUL ENOUGH TO CONSENT TO BE YOUR WIFE
lbi-8173-294714-0021 THE WOMAN IN MY SITUATION MUST BE HEARTLESS INDEED WHO COULD DESTROY YOUR PLACE IN THE ESTIMATION OF THE WORLD AND THE REGARD OF YOUR FRIENDS
lbi-8173-294714-0022 THE WRETCHEDEST CREATURE THAT WALKS THE STREETS WOULD SHRINK FROM TREATING YOU IN THAT WAY
lbi-8173-294714-0023 OH WHAT ARE MEN MADE OF
lbi-8173-294714-0024 HOW CAN YOU HOW CAN YOU SPEAK OF IT
lbi-8173-294714-0025 I YIELDED AND SPOKE OF IT NO MORE
lbi-8173-294714-0026 EVERY WORD SHE UTTERED ONLY INCREASED MY ADMIRATION OF THE NOBLE CREATURE WHOM I HAD LOVED AND LOST
lbi-8173-294714-0027 BITTERLY AS I HATED THE MAN WHO HAD PARTED US I LOVED HER DEARLY ENOUGH TO BE EVEN CAPABLE OF HELPING HIM FOR HER SAKE HOPELESS INFATUATION
lbi-8173-294714-0028 I DON'T DENY IT I DON'T EXCUSE IT HOPELESS INFATUATION YOU HAVE FORGIVEN ME I SAID
lbi-8173-294714-0029 LET ME DESERVE TO BE FORGIVEN
lbi-8173-294714-0030 IT IS SOMETHING TO BE YOUR ONLY FRIEND
lbi-8173-294714-0031 YOU MUST HAVE PLANS FOR THE FUTURE TELL ME UNRESERVEDLY HOW I CAN HELP YOU
lbi-8173-294714-0032 COMPLETE THE GOOD WORK THAT YOU HAVE BEGUN SHE ANSWERED GRATEFULLY HELP ME BACK TO HEALTH
lbi-8173-294714-0033 MAKE ME STRONG ENOUGH TO SUBMIT TO A DOCTOR'S ESTIMATE OF MY CHANCES OF LIVING FOR SOME YEARS YET
lbi-8173-294714-0034 A DOCTOR'S ESTIMATE OF YOUR CHANCES OF LIVING I REPEATED WHAT DO YOU MEAN
lbi-8173-294714-0035 I HARDLY KNOW HOW TO TELL YOU SHE SAID WITHOUT SPEAKING AGAIN OF MISTER VAN BRANDT
lbi-8173-294714-0036 DOES SPEAKING OF HIM AGAIN MEAN SPEAKING OF HIS DEBTS I ASKED
lbi-8173-294714-0037 WHY NEED YOU HESITATE
lbi-8173-294714-0038 YOU KNOW THAT THERE IS NOTHING I WILL NOT DO TO RELIEVE YOUR ANXIETIES
lbi-8173-294714-0039 NEVER LET ME TELL YOU THE PLAIN TRUTH
lbi-8173-294714-0040 THERE IS A SERIOUS NECESSITY FOR HIS GETTING OUT OF PRISON
lbi-8173-294714-0041 YES THIS IS HIS POSITION IN TWO WORDS A LITTLE WHILE SINCE HE OBTAINED AN EXCELLENT OFFER OF EMPLOYMENT ABROAD FROM A RICH RELATIVE OF HIS AND HE HAD MADE ALL HIS ARRANGEMENTS TO ACCEPT IT
lbi-8173-294714-0042 UNHAPPILY HE RETURNED TO TELL ME OF HIS GOOD FORTUNE AND THE SAME DAY HE WAS ARRESTED FOR DEBT
lbi-8173-294714-0043 THE SNARE THAT HAD BEEN SET FOR HER WAS PLAINLY REVEALED IN THOSE FOUR WORDS
lbi-8173-294714-0044 IN THE EYE OF THE LAW SHE WAS OF COURSE A SINGLE WOMAN SHE WAS OF AGE SHE WAS TO ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES HER OWN MISTRESS
lbi-8173-294714-0045 WHAT WAS THERE TO PREVENT HER FROM INSURING HER LIFE IF SHE PLEASED AND FROM SO DISPOSING OF THE INSURANCE AS TO GIVE VAN BRANDT A DIRECT INTEREST IN HER DEATH
lbi-8173-294714-0046 THANKS TO THE HAPPY ACCIDENT OF MY POSITION THE ONE CERTAIN WAY OF PROTECTING HER LAY EASILY WITHIN MY REACH
lbi-8173-294714-0047 I COULD OFFER TO LEND THE SCOUNDREL THE MONEY THAT HE WANTED AT AN HOUR'S NOTICE AND HE WAS THE MAN TO ACCEPT MY PROPOSAL QUITE AS EASILY AS I COULD MAKE IT
lbi-8173-294714-0048 YOU ARE QUITE MISTAKEN I REPLIED
lbi-8173-294714-0049 I AM ONLY DOUBTING WHETHER YOUR PLAN FOR RELIEVING MISTER VAN BRANDT OF HIS EMBARRASSMENTS IS QUITE SO SIMPLE AS YOU SUPPOSE
lbi-8173-294714-0050 ARE YOU AWARE OF THE DELAYS THAT ARE LIKELY TO TAKE PLACE BEFORE IT WILL BE POSSIBLE TO BORROW MONEY ON YOUR POLICY OF INSURANCE
lbi-8173-294714-0051 I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT SHE SAID SADLY
lbi-8173-294714-0052 WILL YOU LET ME ASK THE ADVICE OF MY LAWYERS
lbi-8173-294714-0053 THEY ARE TRUSTWORTHY AND EXPERIENCED MEN AND I AM SURE THEY CAN BE OF USE TO YOU
lbi-8173-294714-0054 CAUTIOUSLY AS I HAD EXPRESSED MYSELF HER DELICACY TOOK THE ALARM
lbi-8173-294714-0055 PROMISE THAT YOU WON'T ASK ME TO BORROW MONEY OF YOU FOR MISTER VAN BRANDT SHE REJOINED AND I WILL ACCEPT YOUR HELP GRATEFULLY
lbi-8173-294714-0056 I COULD HONESTLY PROMISE THAT
lbi-8173-294714-0057 MY ONE CHANCE OF SAVING HER LAY IN KEEPING FROM HER KNOWLEDGE THE COURSE THAT I HAD NOW DETERMINED TO PURSUE
lbi-8173-294714-0058 I ROSE TO GO WHILE MY RESOLUTION STILL SUSTAINED ME
lbi-8173-294714-0059 KISS ME SHE WHISPERED BEFORE YOU GO
lbi-8173-294714-0060 IT IS ONLY YOUR GOODNESS THAT OVERPOWERS ME
lbi-8254-115543-0000 THE NEXT DAY EVERYBODY IN THE HOUSE BEGAN TO MAKE PREPARATIONS FOR THE JOURNEY
lbi-8254-115543-0001 EVERYTHING WAS DONE VERY LEISURELY THOUGH THERE WAS A LOT OF TALKING AND DISPUTING AND THE GIVING OF CONTRARY ORDERS
lbi-8254-115543-0002 THE OLD PORTER WAS THERE DIRECTING AND SCOLDING THE SERVANTS AS THEY PILED THE RUGS AND BLANKETS AND BAGS OF FOOD AND POTS AND PANS AND DISHES INTO THE WAGON
lbi-8254-115543-0003 THERE WAS QUITE A PROCESSION WHEN AT LAST THE BIG WAGON RUMBLED OUT THROUGH THE GATEWAY
lbi-8254-115543-0004 BEHIND IT CAME THE GRANDMOTHER IN HER DHOOLIE DAK A SORT OF A LITTER OR EASY CHAIR SWUNG BETWEEN TWO LONG POLES
lbi-8254-115543-0005 BESIDES THE FAMILY THERE WERE MANY SERVANTS AND SEVERAL OTHERS WALKED BESIDE THE SLOW MOVING WAGON
lbi-8254-115543-0006 THE COOK TOO WENT WITH THEM
lbi-8254-115543-0007 GOOD BYE SHOUTED LITTLE NAO FROM HIS GARDEN WALL AS THEY WENT BY GOOD BYE
lbi-8254-115543-0008 THEY SHOUTED GREETINGS TO THEIR FRIEND THE POTTER AS THEY PASSED HIM AND ALSO TO THE OLD FAKIR SMEARED ALL OVER WITH ASHES WHO SAT IN A LITTLE BRICK HUT BY THE BRIDGE AND PRETENDED TO MAKE WONDERFUL CURES
lbi-8254-115543-0009 THIS IS MORE FUN THAN GOING TO SCHOOL SAID CHOLA AS THE OXEN PLODDED ALONG THROUGH CLOUDS OF DUST
lbi-8254-115543-0010 THESE LOVELY BIRDS ARE FOUND NEARLY EVERYWHERE IN INDIA AND IN SOME PARTS RUN QUITE WILD
lbi-8254-115543-0011 HIS LONG MATTED HAIR HUNG ON HIS SHOULDERS AND HE WAS SAYING HIS PRAYERS WITH THE HELP OF A ROSARY OF BEADS WHICH HE CONTINUALLY PASSED THROUGH HIS HANDS
lbi-8254-115543-0012 AS THE WAGON CAME UP A YOUNG MAN WHO ACCOMPANIED THE HOLY MAN RAN UP AND HELD OUT A BEGGING BOWL SAYING GIVE OH CHARITABLE PEOPLE TO THIS HOLY ONE
lbi-8254-115543-0013 NO COUNTRY IN THE WORLD HAS SO MANY BEGGARS AS INDIA
lbi-8254-115543-0014 MANY OF THEM ARE CALLED HOLY MEN BECAUSE THEY DO NOTHING BUT MAKE PILGRIMAGES FROM ONE SACRED PLACE TO ANOTHER LIVING SOLELY ON THE ALMS THAT ARE GIVEN TO THEM
lbi-8254-115543-0015 WHEN THEY HAD EATEN THEIR LUNCH THE YOUNG PEOPLE WENT TO EXPLORE THE GARDEN NEAR THEM
lbi-8254-115543-0016 PERHAPS THERE ARE DOGS SAID MAHALA A LITTLE FEARFULLY BUT THEY FORGOT ABOUT DOGS WHEN THEY SAW A THICKET OF SUGAR CANE DOWN BY A STREAM
lbi-8254-115543-0017 PERHAPS WE CAN BUY SOME FROM THE MAN THERE HE IS NOW PLOUGHING BY THE STREAM SAID CHOLA
lbi-8254-115543-0018 IT IS LOOKING FOR WATER SAID THE FARMER AS HE TOOK A LONG STALK OF CANE AND GENTLY GUIDED IT DOWN TO THE STREAM
lbi-8254-115543-0019 THE SNAKE IS ANOTHER SACRED ANIMAL OF THE HINDUS AND THEY WOULD NOT KILL OR INJURE ONE FOR ANYTHING
lbi-8254-115543-0020 AS THEY WERE ABOUT TO MOVE ON AGAIN THEY SAW A GREAT CLOUD OF DUST DOWN THE ROAD
lbi-8254-115543-0021 IT TURNED OUT THAT IT WAS A GREAT AND POWERFUL RAJAH GOING IN STATE ON A JOURNEY TO VISIT ANOTHER RAJAH OR RULER OF ONE OF THE SMALL KINGDOMS OR STATES OF WHICH MODERN INDIA WAS FORMERLY MADE UP
lbi-8254-115543-0022 FIRST THERE CAME A BIG ELEPHANT ALL DECORATED WITH SILK AND GOLD AND SILVER
lbi-8254-115543-0023 ON THE ELEPHANT'S BACK WAS A HOWDAH WHICH IS LIKE A BIG CHAIR WITH A CANOPY OVER IT AND IN THIS SITTING CROSS LEGGED WAS THE RAJAH A BIG FAT FELLOW DRESSED IN COLOURED SILKS AND JEWELS WITH A GREAT DIAMOND SET PLUME IN HIS TURBAN
lbi-8254-115543-0024 BEHIND THE HOWDAH STOOD A SERVANT HOLDING A BIG UMBRELLA OF FINE FEATHERS OVER THE RAJAH'S HEAD
lbi-8254-115543-0025 THE DRIVER SAT ON THE NECK OF THE ELEPHANT AND GUIDED THE BIG BEAST BY PRODDING HIM ON ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER WITH AN IRON SHOD STICK OR GOAD
lbi-8254-115543-0026 ISN'T IT FINE TO RIDE LIKE THAT ON A BIG ELEPHANT
lbi-8254-115543-0027 AND ALL THE REST OF THE DAY THE LITTLE FOLK TALKED OF NOTHING BUT THE GREAT RAJAH AND HIS ESCORT
lbi-8254-115543-0028 OUR PARTY CAME TO A HALT AMONG MANY OTHER BULLOCK CARTS THE OWNERS OF WHICH WERE ALREADY SITTING AROUND ON THE GROUND COOKING THEIR SUPPERS OR BARGAINING FOR FOOD AT THE LITTLE BOOTHS
lbi-8254-115543-0029 THESE THEY USED FOR PLATES HEAPING THEM UP WITH THEIR BOILED RICE AND CURRY AND FISH AND ALL SORTS OF PUDDINGS AND SWEETS
lbi-8254-115543-0030 AS SUPPER WAS BEING EATEN ANOTHER PARTY STOPPED AT THE PARAO AND CAMPED NOT FAR AWAY
lbi-8254-115543-0031 WHEN THE LITTER WAS PUT DOWN A YOUNG BOY STEPPED OUT LOOKING VERY PROUD AND HAUGHTY
lbi-8254-115543-0032 HIS SERVANTS AT ONCE SPREAD A HANDSOME RUG ON THE GROUND FOR HIM TO SIT ON AND RUSHED ABOUT WAITING ON HIM TAKING GOOD CARE TO KEEP EVERY ONE AT A DISTANCE
lbi-8254-115543-0033 YES AND HOW HE ORDERS EVERY ONE ABOUT HIM
lbi-8254-115543-0034 AROUND THE LITTLE BRAHMIN'S NECK WAS A THIN CORD OR THREAD WHICH WAS THE SIGN OF HIS HIGH CASTE
lbi-8254-115543-0035 MEANWHILE THE HAUGHTY LITTLE BRAHMIN ATE HIS SUPPER WITH HIS HEAD TURNED AWAY SO NO ONE COULD SEE HIM EAT AND THEN GROWING TIRED OF RESPECTFUL GLANCES OF THE CROWD AROUND HIM HE GOT INTO HIS LITTER AGAIN AND THE SERVANTS FASTENED THE CURTAINS TIGHTLY AROUND HIM
lbi-8254-115543-0036 EVERYBODY SLEPT SOUNDLY IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT ONE OF THE SERVANTS WAS BEATING A DRUM MOST OF THE NIGHT WHICH THEY REALLY BELIEVED WAS THE WAY TO KEEP OFF EVIL SPIRITS
lbi-8254-115543-0037 OH THE THIEVES HE CRIED
lbi-8254-115543-0038 THEY ARE AS BAD AS THE BEGGARS
lbi-8254-115543-0039 WHAT ART THOU GUARDING SO CAREFULLY SHRIYA ASKED HER BROTHER
lbi-8254-115543-0040 HE AND CHOLA WERE WALKING BESIDE THE WAGON FOR A CHANGE
lbi-8254-115543-0041 THE LATTICES WERE RAISED SO SHRIYA AND HER MOTHER AND AUNT COULD ENJOY THE FRESH AIR
lbi-8254-115543-0042 THEY ARE MY DOLLS SAID THE LITTLE GIRL SADLY AS SHE PATTED THE BUNDLE BESIDE HER
lbi-8254-115543-0043 I TAKE THEM AS AN OFFERING TO THE HOLY RIVER POOR LITTLE WOMAN
lbi-8254-115543-0044 MUST THOU SACRIFICE THY TOYS TOO
lbi-8254-115543-0045 SMILED HER UNCLE AS HE PATTED HER HEAD
lbi-8254-84205-0000 CHAPTER FORTY NINE GRIGGS IS STUBBORN
lbi-8254-84205-0001 THE DAYS GLIDED BY WITH THE STIFFNESS IN CHRIS LEE'S LIMBS GROWING LESS PAINFUL AND THE PONY RECOVERING FAST FOR THE CLEAR MOUNTAIN AIR SEEMED TO ACT LIKE A CURE FOR WOUNDS
