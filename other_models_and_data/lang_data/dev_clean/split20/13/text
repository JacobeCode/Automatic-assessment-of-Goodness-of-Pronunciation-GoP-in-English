lbi-5694-64029-0000 WE REMAINED SEVERAL MONTHS BUT SOON WE WERE ON THE TRAMP AGAIN
lbi-5694-64029-0001 THE FEDERAL ARMY WAS CONCENTRATING AT NASHVILLE THERE WAS NO REST FOR THE WEARY
lbi-5694-64029-0002 OUR ARMY STOPPED AT MURFREESBORO
lbi-5694-64029-0003 FROM TIME TO TIME DIFFERENT REGIMENTS WERE SENT FORWARD TO DO PICKET DUTY
lbi-5694-64029-0004 THE YANKEE PICKET LINES WERE NOT A HALF MILE OFF
lbi-5694-64029-0005 I AM A VIDET YOU KNOW THE RESPONSIBILITY RESTING ON ME
lbi-5694-64029-0006 SAYS HE I WOULD NOT TRUST A SECESH ON HIS WORD OATH OR BOND MARCH I SAY
lbi-5694-64029-0007 I SOON FOUND OUT THAT HE HAD CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE RELIEF ON THE ROAD AND WAS AFRAID TO SHOOT I QUICKLY MADE UP MY MIND
lbi-5694-64029-0008 MY GUN WAS AT MY FEET AND ONE STEP WOULD GET IT
lbi-5694-64029-0009 I MADE A QUICK GLANCE OVER MY SHOULDER AND GRABBED AT MY GUN
lbi-5694-64029-0010 HE DIVINED MY MOTIVE AND FIRED THE BALL MISSED ITS AIM
lbi-5694-64029-0011 I THINK WE MUST HAVE KILLED A GOOD MANY IN THE OLD FIELD BECAUSE WE WERE FIRING ALL THE TIME AT THE SOLID LINE AS THEY ADVANCED UPON US
lbi-5694-64029-0012 WE KEPT FALLING BACK AND FIRING ALL DAY AND WERE RELIEVED BY ANOTHER REGIMENT ABOUT DARK WE REJOINED OUR REGIMENT
lbi-5694-64029-0013 LINE OF BATTLE WAS FORMED ON THE NORTH BANK OF STONE'S RIVER ON THE YANKEE SIDE
lbi-5694-64029-0014 BAD GENERALSHIP I THOUGHT IT WAS CHRISTMAS
lbi-5694-64029-0015 THE PRIVATE COULD BUT HE WAS NO GENERAL YOU SEE
lbi-5694-64029-0016 I CALLED LIEUTENANT COLONEL FRIERSON'S ATTENTION TO THE YANKEES AND HE REMARKED WELL I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THEY ARE YANKEES OR NOT BUT IF THEY ARE THEY WILL COME OUT OF THERE MIGHTY QUICK
lbi-5694-64029-0017 THE YANKEES MARCHED OVER THE HILL OUT OF SIGHT
lbi-5694-64029-0018 WE WERE ORDERED FORWARD TO THE ATTACK
lbi-5694-64029-0019 WE WERE RIGHT UPON THE YANKEE LINE ON THE WILKERSON TURNPIKE
lbi-5694-64029-0020 WE WERE NOT TWENTY YARDS OFF FROM THE YANKEES AND THEY WERE POURING THE HOT SHOT AND SHELLS RIGHT INTO OUR RANKS AND EVERY MAN WAS YELLING AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE CEASE FIRING YOU ARE FIRING ON YOUR OWN MEN CEASE FIRING YOU ARE FIRING ON YOUR OWN MEN
lbi-5694-64029-0021 OAKLEY COLOR BEARER OF THE FOURTH TENNESSEE REGIMENT RAN RIGHT UP IN THE MIDST OF THE YANKEE LINE WITH HIS COLORS BEGGING HIS MEN TO FOLLOW
lbi-5694-64029-0022 THE LEADEN HAIL STORM SWEPT THEM OFF THE FIELD THEY FELL BACK AND RE FORMED
lbi-5694-64029-0023 WE WERE AT THAT TIME AT LEAST A HUNDRED YARDS IN ADVANCE OF THE BRIGADE CHEATHAM ALL THE TIME CALLING UPON THE MEN TO COME ON
lbi-5694-64029-0024 I SAW AND FELT THAT HE WAS NOT FIGHTING FOR GLORY BUT THAT HE WAS FIGHTING FOR HIS COUNTRY BECAUSE HE LOVED THAT COUNTRY AND HE WAS WILLING TO GIVE HIS LIFE FOR HIS COUNTRY AND THE SUCCESS OF OUR CAUSE
lbi-5694-64029-0025 I THOUGHT IT HAD BEEN TORN FROM MY SHOULDER
lbi-5694-64029-0026 AS I WENT BACK TO THE FIELD HOSPITAL I OVERTOOK ANOTHER MAN WALKING ALONG
lbi-5694-64029-0027 I LOOKED AT IT PRETTY CLOSE AND I SAID GREAT GOD
lbi-5694-64029-0028 HE WAS WALKING ALONG WHEN ALL AT ONCE HE DROPPED DOWN AND DIED WITHOUT A STRUGGLE OR A GROAN
lbi-5694-64029-0029 BUT I COULD NOT BEAR THE THOUGHT OF WEARING DEAD MEN'S SHOES
lbi-5694-64029-0030 HE WAS STONE DEAD BUT I DROPPED THAT FOOT QUICK
lbi-5694-64029-0031 BEFORE WE ARRIVED AT THE HOUSE WE SAW A BODY OF YANKEES APPROACHING AND AS WE STARTED TO RUN BACK THEY FIRED UPON US
lbi-5694-64029-0032 OUR PICKETS HAD RUN IN AND REPORTED A NIGHT ATTACK
lbi-5694-64038-0000 ADVANCE INTO TENNESSEE
lbi-5694-64038-0001 YANK SAYS WHAT YOU DOING JOHNNY
lbi-5694-64038-0002 WE PASSED AROUND ATLANTA CROSSED THE CHATTAHOOCHEE AND TRAVELED BACK OVER THE SAME ROUTE ON WHICH WE HAD MADE THE ARDUOUS CAMPAIGN UNDER JOE JOHNSTON
lbi-5694-64038-0003 OUTSIDE OF THESE OCCASIONAL REMINDERS WE COULD SEE NO EVIDENCE OF THE DESOLATION OF THE TRACK OF AN INVADING ARMY
lbi-5694-64038-0004 WE SAW THE UNITED STATES FLAG FLYING FROM THE RAMPARTS AND THOUGHT THAT YANK WOULD PROBABLY BE ASLEEP OR CATCHING LICE OR MAYBE ENGAGED IN A GAME OF SEVEN UP
lbi-5694-64038-0005 HE WALKED UP AND SAYS HELLO BOYS WHAT IS IT BOSS
lbi-5694-64038-0006 A YANKEE ALWAYS SAYS NAGER
lbi-5694-64038-0007 THEY PERSUADED ELOQUENTLY
lbi-5694-64038-0008 A MAN IN THE WELL
lbi-5694-64038-0009 THE VOICE APPEARED TO BE OVERHEAD
lbi-5694-64038-0010 RIGHT BEFORE ME I SAW THE LONG DRY GRASS ALL BENDING TOWARD A COMMON CENTER AND I KNEW THAT IT WAS AN OLD WELL AND THAT MY COMRADE HAD FALLEN IN IT
lbi-5694-64038-0011 BUT HOW TO GET HIM OUT WAS THE UNSOLVED PROBLEM
lbi-5694-64038-0012 THE POOR FELLOW STAYED IN THAT WELL ALL NIGHT
lbi-5694-64038-0013 WE LOOKED ALL AROUND AND THOUGHT THAT THE COAST WAS CLEAR
lbi-5694-64038-0014 I DON'T THINK HIS GUN WAS LOADED THOUGH BECAUSE WE DID NOT HEAR THE BALL WHISTLE
lbi-5694-64038-0015 WE WALKED OVER THIS FLOATING BRIDGE AND SOON FOUND OURSELVES ON THE TENNESSEE SIDE OF TENNESSEE RIVER
lbi-5694-64038-0016 WE HAD BEEF FOR SUPPER THAT NIGHT
lbi-5694-64038-0017 HOW EVERY PULSE DID BEAT AND LEAP AND HOW EVERY HEART DID THROB WITH EMOTIONS OF JOY WHICH SEEMED NEARLY AKIN TO HEAVEN WHEN WE RECEIVED THE GLAD INTELLIGENCE OF OUR ONWARD MARCH TOWARD THE LAND OF PROMISE AND OF OUR LOVED ONES
lbi-5694-64038-0018 WE WERE INURED TO PRIVATIONS AND HARDSHIPS HAD BEEN UPON EVERY MARCH IN EVERY BATTLE IN EVERY SKIRMISH IN EVERY ADVANCE IN EVERY RETREAT IN EVERY VICTORY IN EVERY DEFEAT
lbi-5694-64038-0019 HE WANTED TO GO BY HOME AND TELL HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN GOOD BYE AND TO GET HIS CLOTHES IT WAS NO GO
lbi-5694-64038-0020 BUT AFTER AWHILE JIM SAYS GENTLEMEN AY GANNY THE LAW
lbi-5694-64038-0021 YOU SEE JIM KNOWED THE LAW
lbi-5694-64038-0022 THOSE OLD SOLDIERS HAD LONG LONG AGO FORGOTTEN ABOUT THAT OLD LAW OF THE LONG GONE PAST BUT JIM HAD TREASURED IT UP IN HIS MEMORY LO THESE MANY YEARS AND HE THOUGHT IT WOULD SERVE HIM NOW AS IT HAD NO DOUBT FREQUENTLY DONE IN THE PAST
lbi-5694-64038-0023 THE THIRD DAY IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE YANKEES HAD TAKEN POSITION ON THE MURFREESBORO PIKE
lbi-5694-64038-0024 A REGIMENT WAS SENT TO THE ATTACK IT WAS JIM'S REGIMENT
lbi-5694-64038-0025 HE HADN'T SEEN ANYTHING TO SHOOT AT BUT HE BLAZED AWAY HE LOADED AND FIRED THE SECOND TIME WHEN THEY WERE ORDERED TO RETREAT
lbi-5895-34615-0000 BUT IS LAUGHTER A SYNONYM OF JOY
lbi-5895-34615-0001 SUCH PERFECT COMPLETENESS IS NOT IN NATURE
lbi-5895-34615-0002 HAD GWYNPLAINE WHEN A CHILD BEEN SO WORTHY OF ATTENTION THAT HIS FACE HAD BEEN SUBJECTED TO TRANSMUTATION WHY NOT
lbi-5895-34615-0003 ACCORDING TO ALL APPEARANCE INDUSTRIOUS MANIPULATORS OF CHILDREN HAD WORKED UPON HIS FACE
lbi-5895-34615-0004 IT SEEMED EVIDENT THAT A MYSTERIOUS AND PROBABLY OCCULT SCIENCE WHICH WAS TO SURGERY WHAT ALCHEMY WAS TO CHEMISTRY HAD CHISELLED HIS FLESH EVIDENTLY AT A VERY TENDER AGE AND MANUFACTURED HIS COUNTENANCE WITH PREMEDITATION
lbi-5895-34615-0005 GWYNPLAINE WAS A MOUNTEBANK
lbi-5895-34615-0006 HE SHOWED HIMSELF ON THE PLATFORM
lbi-5895-34615-0007 IT WAS GWYNPLAINE'S LAUGH WHICH CREATED THE LAUGHTER OF OTHERS YET HE DID NOT LAUGH HIMSELF
lbi-5895-34615-0008 THE OUTSIDE DID NOT DEPEND ON THE INTERIOR
lbi-5895-34615-0009 NO ONE COULD ESCAPE FROM THIS RICTUS
lbi-5895-34615-0010 ALL HIS EMOTIONS WHATEVER THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN AUGMENTED HIS STRANGE FACE OF JOY OR TO SPEAK MORE CORRECTLY AGGRAVATED IT
lbi-5895-34615-0011 AN EVERLASTING LAUGH
lbi-5895-34615-0012 THE MANICHAEANS BELIEVED THE ABSOLUTE OCCASIONALLY GIVES WAY AND THAT GOD HIMSELF SOMETIMES ABDICATES FOR A TIME SO ALSO OF THE WILL
lbi-5895-34615-0013 THE WHOLE OF EXISTENCE RESEMBLES A LETTER MODIFIED IN THE POSTSCRIPT
lbi-5895-34615-0014 WITH THIS EXCEPTION GWYNPLAINE'S LAUGH WAS EVERLASTING
lbi-5895-34615-0015 THE JOYOUS CONVULSION OF LAUGHTER WAS AS A TRIBUTE PAID THEY SUBMITTED TO IT GLADLY BUT ALMOST MECHANICALLY
lbi-5895-34615-0016 BESIDES WE MUST REMEMBER THAT THEY HAD IN THOSE TIMES MEANS OF PUTTING PATIENTS TO SLEEP AND OF SUPPRESSING ALL SUFFERING ONLY THEN IT WAS CALLED MAGIC WHILE NOW IT IS CALLED ANAESTHESIA
lbi-5895-34615-0017 BESIDES THIS FACE THOSE WHO HAD BROUGHT HIM UP HAD GIVEN HIM THE RESOURCES OF A GYMNAST AND AN ATHLETE
lbi-5895-34615-0018 GWYNPLAINE HAD YELLOW HAIR
lbi-5895-34615-0019 HIS HAIR HAVING PROBABLY BEEN DYED WITH SOME CORROSIVE PREPARATION HAD LEFT IT WOOLLY AND ROUGH TO THE TOUCH
lbi-5895-34615-0020 ITS YELLOW BRISTLES RATHER A MANE THAN A HEAD OF HAIR COVERED AND CONCEALED A LOFTY BROW EVIDENTLY MADE TO CONTAIN THOUGHT
lbi-5895-34615-0021 THE OPERATION WHATEVER IT HAD BEEN WHICH HAD DEPRIVED HIS FEATURES OF HARMONY AND PUT ALL THEIR FLESH INTO DISORDER HAD HAD NO EFFECT ON THE BONY STRUCTURE OF HIS HEAD
lbi-5895-34622-0000 WHAT TRUE THINGS ARE TOLD IN STORIES
lbi-5895-34622-0001 IN GWYNPLAINE EVIL THOUGHTS NEVER RIPENED AND HE HAD THEREFORE NO REMORSE
lbi-5895-34622-0002 WHAT WAS THIS NOTHING
lbi-5895-34622-0003 FROM SIXTEEN EIGHTY TO SEVENTEEN O FOUR A GREAT CHANGE HAD TAKEN PLACE
lbi-5895-34622-0004 THE WHEELS WERE ALL OF THE SAME SIZE AND HIGH AS WAGON WHEELS
lbi-5895-34622-0005 THIS GREEN COLOUR HAD SUCCEEDED IN DRAWING ATTENTION TO THE CARRIAGE WHICH WAS KNOWN IN ALL THE FAIR GROUNDS AS THE GREEN BOX
lbi-5895-34622-0006 ON THE ROOF FROM A TUBE PAINTED GREEN LIKE THE REST SMOKE AROSE
lbi-5895-34622-0007 THE ASTONISHMENT WITH WHICH THE VILLAGERS REGARDED THIS MACHINE WAS OVERWHELMING
lbi-5895-34622-0008 THIS WAS THE OLD ESTABLISHMENT OF URSUS ITS PROPORTIONS AUGMENTED BY SUCCESS AND IMPROVED FROM A WRETCHED BOOTH INTO A THEATRE
lbi-5895-34622-0009 UNKNOWN PEOPLE HAD WORKED UPON HIS FACE HE ON THE OTHER HAND HAD WORKED ON HIS MIND AND BEHIND THIS WELL EXECUTED MASK HE HAD PLACED ALL THAT HE COULD OF THOUGHT
lbi-5895-34622-0010 THE EFFECT OF HIS APPEARANCE HAD BEEN SURPRISING
lbi-5895-34622-0011 SOME BELIEVED IT TO BE NATURAL OTHERS DECLARED IT TO BE ARTIFICIAL AND AS CONJECTURE WAS ADDED TO REALITY EVERYWHERE AT EVERY CROSS ROAD ON THE JOURNEY IN ALL THE GROUNDS OF FAIRS AND FETES THE CROWD RAN AFTER GWYNPLAINE
lbi-5895-34622-0012 THE CURIOSITY OF ONE PLACE EXHAUSTED THEY PASSED ON TO ANOTHER
lbi-5895-34622-0013 THIS FORTUNE HAD ALLOWED URSUS WHO WAS THE ADMINISTRATOR OF GWYNPLAINE'S SUCCESS TO HAVE THE CHARIOT OF HIS DREAMS CONSTRUCTED THAT IS TO SAY A CARAVAN LARGE ENOUGH TO CARRY A THEATRE AND TO SOW SCIENCE AND ART IN THE HIGHWAYS
lbi-5895-34622-0014 FOR THESE READ FIBI AND VINOS THAT WE MAY CONFORM TO ENGLISH PRONUNCIATION
lbi-5895-34622-0015 PHOEBE COOKED VENUS SCRUBBED THE TEMPLE
lbi-5895-34622-0016 URSUS AND HOMO TOOK CHARGE OF EACH OTHER
lbi-5895-34622-0017 THIS HUT IN A CORNER AT THE BACK TO THE RIGHT OF THE DOOR SERVED AS BEDCHAMBER AND DRESSING ROOM TO URSUS AND GWYNPLAINE
lbi-5895-34622-0018 THE CARAVAN WAS DIVIDED INTO THREE COMPARTMENTS PARTITIONED FROM EACH OTHER
lbi-5895-34622-0019 A LOFT UNDER THE ARCH OF THE ROOF CONTAINED THE SCENES AND ON OPENING A TRAP DOOR LAMPS APPEARED PRODUCING WONDERS OF LIGHT
lbi-5895-34622-0020 URSUS WAS THE POET OF THESE MAGICAL REPRESENTATIONS HE WROTE THE PIECES
lbi-5895-34622-0021 THEN I LOOK PERHAPS LIKE WHAT I AM
lbi-5895-34622-0022 THIS OPENING LOOKED FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE A MOUTH OF HELL IN THE WORDS OF THE ITINERANT PURITAN PREACHERS WHO TURNED AWAY FROM IT WITH HORROR
lbi-5895-34622-0023 URSUS WAS IN EVERYTHING IN THE PIECE IN THE COMPANY IN THE KITCHEN IN THE ORCHESTRA
lbi-5895-34629-0000 IT WAS ESTABLISHED AT SOUTHWARK
lbi-5895-34629-0001 THE DOME OF SAINT PAUL'S WAS A DELIGHT TO URSUS
lbi-5895-34629-0002 SAINT PAUL IS A SAINT ONLY WITH EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES
lbi-5895-34629-0003 HE ENTERED HEAVEN ONLY BY THE ARTISTS DOOR
lbi-5895-34629-0004 IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN ORDERED FOR THE GREEN BOX
lbi-5895-34629-0005 IT WAS A THEATRE READY MADE
lbi-5895-34629-0006 AGAINST THIS WALL WAS PLACED THE GREEN BOX WHICH THEY WERE ABLE TO DRAW INTO THE YARD OWING TO THE HEIGHT OF THE GATE
lbi-5895-34629-0007 THE PLACARD GWYNPLAINE THE LAUGHING MAN TAKEN FROM ITS NAIL IN THE GREEN BOX WAS HUNG UP CLOSE TO THE SIGN OF THE INN
lbi-5895-34629-0008 BY THE SIDE OF THE DOOR WAS CONSTRUCTED OFF HAND BY MEANS OF AN EMPTY BARREL A BOX FOR THE MONEY TAKER WHO WAS SOMETIMES FIBI AND SOMETIMES VINOS
lbi-5895-34629-0009 WE ARE IN LONDON SAID URSUS WE MUST BE PREPARED FOR THE GENTRY
lbi-5895-34629-0010 THEY BEGAN THEIR PERFORMANCES
lbi-5895-34629-0011 WITH THAT EXCEPTION THEIR SUCCESS BECAME SO GREAT THAT NO MOUNTEBANK MEMORY COULD RECALL ITS PARALLEL
lbi-5895-34629-0012 ALL SOUTHWARK RAN IN CROWDS TO ADMIRE THE LAUGHING MAN
lbi-5895-34629-0013 THE MERRY ANDREWS AND MOUNTEBANKS OF TARRINZEAU FIELD WERE AGHAST AT GWYNPLAINE
lbi-5895-34629-0014 GWYNPLAINE ATE UP THEIR PUBLIC
lbi-5895-34629-0015 BESIDES THE SMALL FRY THE SWALLOWERS OF SWORDS AND THE GRIMACE MAKERS REAL PERFORMANCES TOOK PLACE ON THE GREEN
lbi-5895-34629-0016 EVEN THIS COMEDIAN OF JAWS AND CLAWS WAS ECLIPSED IN SUCCESS
lbi-5895-34629-0017 THAT SUCCESS WAS PRODIGIOUS STILL IT REMAINED LOCAL
lbi-5895-34629-0018 IT TOOK A HUNDRED AND THIRTY YEARS FOR THE NAME OF SHAKESPEARE TO PENETRATE FROM ENGLAND INTO FRANCE
lbi-5895-34629-0019 THE GLORY OF GWYNPLAINE HAD NOT PASSED LONDON BRIDGE
lbi-5895-34629-0020 THESE WERE REMARKABLE TALENTS
lbi-5895-34629-0021 BESIDES THIS HE HARANGUED LIKE CICERO AS WE HAVE JUST SEEN SOLD HIS DRUGS ATTENDED SICKNESS AND EVEN HEALED THE SICK
lbi-5895-34629-0022 URSUS WAS SATISFIED WITH THE APPLAUSE OF SOUTHWARK BUT BY NO MEANS ASTONISHED
lbi-5895-34629-0023 AT EVERY PERFORMANCE THE YARD OF THE INN TRANSFORMED INTO A PIT WAS FILLED WITH A RAGGED AND ENTHUSIASTIC AUDIENCE
lbi-5895-34629-0024 THE EMPTYING OF TANKARDS DID NOT DECREASE THEIR SUCCESS
lbi-5895-34629-0025 THIS CONNOISSEUR WAS SUDDENLY FASCINATED AND HAD ADOPTED THE LAUGHING MAN
lbi-5895-34629-0026 HE DID NOT COME EVERY EVENING BUT WHEN HE CAME HE LED THE PUBLIC APPLAUSE GREW INTO ACCLAMATION SUCCESS ROSE NOT TO THE ROOF FOR THERE WAS NONE BUT TO THE CLOUDS FOR THERE WERE PLENTY OF THEM
lbi-5895-34629-0027 WHICH CLOUDS SEEING THAT THERE WAS NO ROOF SOMETIMES WEPT OVER THE MASTERPIECE OF URSUS
lbi-5895-34629-0028 HIS ENTHUSIASM CAUSED URSUS TO REMARK THIS MAN AND GWYNPLAINE TO OBSERVE HIM
lbi-5895-34629-0029 THEY HAD A GREAT FRIEND IN THIS UNKNOWN VISITOR
lbi-5895-34629-0030 ONE EVENING URSUS WAS IN THE SIDE SCENE WHICH WAS THE KITCHEN DOOR OF THE GREEN BOX SEEING MASTER NICLESS STANDING BY HIM SHOWED HIM THIS MAN IN THE CROWD AND ASKED HIM
lbi-5895-34629-0031 WHAT A PITY THAT HE SHOULD NOT BE A LORD
lbi-5895-34629-0032 HE WOULD MAKE A FAMOUS SCOUNDREL
lbi-5895-34629-0033 AT THAT HOUR THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE FAIR GROUND EXCEPT PERHAPS SOME REELING DRUNKARD MAKING STAGGERING SHADOWS IN DARK CORNERS
