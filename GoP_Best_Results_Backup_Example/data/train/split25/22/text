096040001	HE JUMPED UP BUT ALL WAS STILL ABOUT HIM
096040002	SHE TURNED AND LOOKED AT HER OTHER FRIENDS
096040004	IT IS ONLY FOR YOU
096040005	THEY WOULD NEVER ACCEPT ME AS A GIRL
096040006	I COULD SEE THAT HIS HANDS WERE SHAKING TOO
096040007	SOON YOU WILL HAVE TO GO OUT ON YOUR OWN
096040008	THERE WAS NO ONE LEFT
096040009	THIS WAS NOT MY DAY
096040010	YOU JUST KNOW THAT IT MAKES YOU FEEL GOOD RIGHT
096040011	I WONDER WHAT WAS GOING ON OVER THERE
096040012	SO ARE YOU HERE TO PLAY WITH ME
096040014	IF YOU WANT TO PROVE SOMETHING THEN DO IT
096040015	THAT WAS WHEN HE SAW IT
096040016	THE MAN RUBBED HIS EYES AND LOOKED INTO IT AGAIN
096040018	AND PUT A HAND DOWN TO HELP HIM UP
096040019	THEY WALKED SLOWLY TO THE VERY END OF IT
096040021	WHAT WAS HE DOING AT THIS MOMENT
096040023	I AM RICH AND SO WAS MY FATHER BEFORE ME
096040024	SHE WAS LOOKING FOR A BREATH OF LIFE
096040025	THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE GAINED BY IT
096060001	HE HAD COME OUT ON JOBS WITH ME BEFORE
096060002	I JUST LOOK AT HIM
096060003	THE TWO OF YOU WILL NEED IT
096060004	BUT SHE IS MY LIFE
096060005	IN HIS EYES HE ONLY SAW HER
096060006	WE DO NOT WANT THAT TO HAPPEN NOW DO WE
096060007	I LOOKED OVER THEM ALL
096060008	THERE IS NO HOPE FOR ANY OF US HERE
096060009	IT WAS AN AWFUL THING YET WHAT COULD HE DO
096060010	YOU THOUGHT THE DREADFUL PLACE HAD YOU ONCE MORE
096060011	I LET THE TIME GET AWAY FROM ME
096060012	HE OPENED UP THE DOOR
096060013	THEY HAD A LITTLE GIRL
096060014	I TURNED TO GO THE OTHER WAY
096060015	SHE WANTED TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THIS
096060016	THIS IS WHEN ALL OF THE GUARDS BUT ONE LEFT
096060017	HE MUST TURN AROUND TO SEE IF IT IS HER
096060019	I SHOULD NEVER DO IT AGAIN
096060020	I ASKED AS HE MADE A LONG PAUSE
096060022	THAT WAS ALL SHE NEEDED TO DO RIGHT
096070002	BUT THERE WAS NO ONE COMING HIS WAY
096070003	HE WOULD DO IT FOR THEM YES FOR THEM
096070005	I COULD TELL THEY WERE PLOTTING SOMETHING BUT WHAT
096070006	IT WAS ALWAYS ABOUT HIM
096070007	I AM NOT HAPPY WITH YOU RIGHT NOW
096070008	THEY THOUGHT SHE WAS GOING TO WALK OUT AGAIN
096070011	I LIKE TO SEE A MAN ENJOY HIMSELF
096070012	WE ARE LOOKING FOR YOU
096070013	THE OTHER TURNED BACK TO THE DOOR SHAKING HIS HEAD
096070014	HE WALKED INTO THE ROOM HE HAD JUMPED FROM
096070015	HE THEN ASKED ME IF I WAS AN ENGLISHMAN
096070016	THAT WAS WHEN SHE SAW IT
096070017	SHE HAD HER HAND OVER HER LEFT CHECK
096070018	THIS IS THE END OF THE FIRST CHAPTER
096070019	IT WAS TOO MUCH TO TAKE
096070020	APART FROM THAT I HAVE VERY LITTLE TO SAY
096070021	HE STILL HAD TO MAKE IT THROUGH THE NIGHT
096070022	SHE STOPPED TO LOOK DOWN ON HIM
096070023	HE TURNED AROUND AND LOOKED AT ME WHAT
096070024	SHE WAS NOTHING BUT A MURDERER AFTER ALL
096090001	IF HE WAS CALLED UP AGAIN HE WOULD GO AGAIN
096090003	THE GIRL THEN LOOKED AT HER HAND
096090005	WHAT WILL THEY DO IF SOMETHING HAPPENS TO ME
096090006	WE HAVE THE BEST PEOPLE ON THIS
096090007	IT WAS AS MUCH AS MY LIFE WAS WORTH
096090008	THERE WAS NO WAY TO TELL FOR SURE
096090010	I WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED BUT NOT NOW
096090011	I COULD JUST BARELY SEE IT FROM HERE
096090014	I MADE HIM LOOK ME INTO THE EYES
096090015	THIS IS NOT GOING TO WORK
096090017	I WAS COMPLETELY IN MY OWN WORLD RIGHT NOW
096090018	THAT MUST NOT BE IT
096090019	I WAS FOUND BY THEM WHEN I WAS A BABY
096090020	BUT EVEN THAT IS PUTTING HER WILL FIRST
096090021	SO I WILL MAKE A BARGAIN WITH YOU
096090023	I HAVE WATCHED YOU LONG ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT
096090024	SHE HAD ALWAYS THOUGHT OF ME AS AN ENEMY
096090025	BUT WHERE WAS SHE THAT SHE SEEMED SO ABSENT
096090026	HE WAS AT A BETTER PLACE
096090027	SHE ACCEPTED IT AND PUT IT WITH HER THINGS
096110001	THEY JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE I WAS ALL RIGHT
096110002	HE COULD SEE IT WISH HE COULD NOT
096110003	BUT THE EYES WERE THE THING
096110004	AND A GIRL AT THAT
096110005	IT IS YOU WHO IS NO MATCH FOR ME
096110006	YOU GET TO DO THIS JOB ON YOUR OWN
096110008	NO ONE HAD TO KNOW
096110009	I SAY AS I TAKE OUT MY PAPERS
096110011	HE LEFT THEM THERE FOR A LONG TIME HANGING THERE
096110012	I BELIEVE WE SHOULD ALL COME WITH YOU
096110013	I THOUGHT ABOUT IT MORE
096110014	I HAD TO TURN MYSELF AROUND AND GO BACK
096110015	I TURNED TO LOOK BEHIND ME AND SAW NOTHING
096110016	IT WAS THE JAPANESE MAN FROM THE OTHER NIGHT
096110017	HE SEEMED MADE TO LIVE WITH NO ONE BUT HIMSELF
096110018	THIS WAS GOING TO BE A GOOD FIGHT
096110019	WHY WOULD SHE WANT HIM IN THE FIRST PLACE
096110021	BUT THAN THERE WAS STILL HER FATHER
096110022	WHAT ELSE IS THERE TO DO HERE
096110023	BUT I THINK HE MIGHT BE A LITTLE MORE ENTHUSIASTIC
