lbi-3853-163249-0000 HER MEETING WITH LETTY WAS INDESCRIBABLY TENDER AND THE DAYS THAT FOLLOWED WERE PRETTY EQUALLY DIVIDED BETWEEN HER AND HER BROTHER IN NURSING THE ONE AND LOVING THE OTHER
lbi-3853-163249-0001 BUT EVEN WHILE SHE ENJOYED EVERY HOUR OF LIFE AND BEGRUDGED THE TIME GIVEN TO SLEEP SHE FELT AS IF THE DREAM WAS TOO BEAUTIFUL TO LAST AND OFTEN SAID
lbi-3853-163249-0002 SO CHRISTIE TURNED A DEAF EAR TO HER PROPHETIC SOUL AND GAVE HERSELF UP TO THE BLISSFUL HOLIDAY THAT HAD COME AT LAST
lbi-3853-163249-0003 NOTHING CAN SURPRISE ME NOW I'M PREPARED FOR ANY THING EVEN THE SIGHT OF MY QUAKERISH LOVER DANCING A JIG
lbi-3853-163249-0004 I FEEL LIKE A BOY OUT OF SCHOOL OR RATHER A MAN OUT OF PRISON AND MUST ENJOY MY LIBERTY IN SOME WAY
lbi-3853-163249-0005 I'M NOT A TALKER YOU KNOW AND AS THE LAWS OF GRAVITATION FORBID MY SOARING ALOFT ANYWHERE I CAN ONLY EXPRESS MY JOYFULLY UPLIFTED STATE OF MIND BY PRANCING AS YOU CALL IT
lbi-3853-163249-0006 I DON'T WANT YOU TO I LOVE TO SEE YOU SO YOUNG AND HAPPY ONLY YOU ARE NOT THE OLD DAVID AND I'VE GOT TO GET ACQUAINTED WITH THE NEW ONE
lbi-3853-163249-0007 I HOPE YOU'LL LIKE HIM BETTER THAN THE FROST BITTEN OLD DAVID YOU FIRST KNEW AND WERE KIND ENOUGH TO LOVE
lbi-3853-163249-0008 MOTHER SAYS I'VE GONE BACK TO THE TIME BEFORE WE LOST LETTY AND I SOMETIMES FEEL AS IF I HAD
lbi-3853-163249-0009 IN THAT CASE YOU WILL FIND ME A PROUD IMPETUOUS AMBITIOUS FELLOW CHRISTIE AND HOW WILL THAT SUIT
lbi-3853-163249-0010 EXCELLENTLY I LIKE PRIDE OF YOUR SORT IMPETUOSITY BECOMES YOU FOR YOU HAVE LEARNED TO CONTROL IT IF NEED BE AND THE AMBITION IS BEST OF ALL
lbi-3853-163249-0011 I SHALL WAIT FOR TIME TO SHOW
lbi-3853-163249-0012 THEN THEY WENT BACK TO THEIR WORK LITTLE DREAMING AS THEY TIED ROSES AND TWINED SMILAX WREATHS HOW NEAR THAT OTHER CHANCE WAS HOW SOON THEY WERE TO BE CALLED UPON TO KEEP THEIR PROMISE AND HOW WELL EACH WAS TO PERFORM THE PART GIVEN THEM IN LIFE AND DEATH
lbi-3853-163249-0013 TO NO HOME IN THE LAND DID THE GREAT TROUBLE BRING A MORE SUDDEN CHANGE THAN THE LITTLE COTTAGE IN THE LANE
lbi-3853-163249-0014 DAVID WAS SOBER ENOUGH NOW AND WENT ABOUT HIS WORK WITH A GRIM SET TO HIS LIPS AND A SPARK IN HIS EYES THAT MADE THE THREE WOMEN LOOK AT ONE ANOTHER PALE WITH UNSPOKEN APPREHENSION
lbi-3853-163249-0015 IT IS TERRIBLE AND YET GLORIOUS
lbi-3853-163249-0016 DAVID HELD IT CLOSE IN BOTH OF HIS SAYING GRATEFULLY THANK YOU MOTHER THEN FIXING HIS EYES ON THE YOUNGER YET NOT DEARER WOMEN HE ADDED WITH A RING IN HIS VOICE THAT MADE THEIR HEARTS ANSWER WITH A PROMPT AY AY IN SPITE OF LOVE OR FEAR
lbi-3853-163249-0017 THE BOYS BLESS THEIR BRAVE HEARTS HAVE DONE NOBLY BUT OLDER MEN ARE NEEDED NOW WE CANNOT SACRIFICE ALL THE GALLANT LADS AND WE WHO HAVE MORE TO LOSE THAN THEY MUST TAKE OUR TURN AND TRY TO DO AS WELL
lbi-3853-163249-0018 YES DAVID SISTER AND SWEETHEART ANSWERED BRAVELY FORGETTING IN THE FERVOR OF THE MOMENT WHAT HEAVY CONSEQUENCES GOD MIGHT SEE FIT TO SEND GOOD
lbi-3853-163249-0019 BENNET WILL TAKE THE GARDEN AND GREEN HOUSE OFF MY HANDS THIS AUTUMN FOR A YEAR OR LONGER IF I LIKE
lbi-3853-163249-0020 HE'S A KIND NEIGHBORLY MAN AND HIS BOY WILL TAKE MY PLACE ABOUT THE HOUSE AND PROTECT YOU FAITHFULLY
lbi-3853-163249-0021 I KNEW YOU WOULD GO I SAW YOU GETTING READY AND I MADE UP MY MIND TO FOLLOW
lbi-3853-163249-0022 YOU WILL LET ME DO IT AND IN RETURN I WILL MARRY YOU WHENEVER YOU ASK ME ANSWERED CHRISTIE SEALING THE PROMISE WITH A KISS THAT SILENCED HIM
lbi-3853-163249-0023 YOU'VE SOMETHING TO TELL ME I SEE IT IN YOUR FACE DEAR I MUST GO
lbi-3853-163249-0024 NEXT EVENING AS MISSUS STERLING SAT ALONE IN THE TWILIGHT A TALL MAN IN ARMY BLUE ENTERED QUIETLY STOOD WATCHING THE TRANQUIL FIGURE FOR A MOMENT THEN WENT AND KNELT DOWN BESIDE IT SAYING WITH A MOST UNSOLDIERLY CHOKE IN THE VOICE
lbi-3853-163249-0025 THE LOYAL FRENZY FELL UPON THE THREE QUIET WOMEN AND THEY COULD NOT DO TOO MUCH FOR THEIR COUNTRY
lbi-3853-163249-0026 IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN MANY KNAPSACKS TO HOLD ALL THE GIFTS SHOWERED UPON HIM BY HIS FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS
lbi-3853-163249-0027 FINDING THAT LISHA SHOWED LITTLE ENTHUSIASM ON THE SUBJECT SHE TRIED TO ROUSE HIM BY PATRIOTIC APPEALS OF VARIOUS SORTS
lbi-3853-163249-0028 VERY WELL SAID MISSUS WILKINS RESOLUTELY TO HERSELF EF I CAN'T MAKE NO IMPRESSION ON HIS SOUL I WILL ON HIS STOMMICK AND SEE HOW THAT'LL WORK
lbi-3853-163249-0029 WE CAN'T AFFORD NO NICE VITTLES NOW WHEN OUR MEN ARE SUFFERIN SO
lbi-3853-163249-0030 HE WAS NOT AS UNMOVED AS HE SEEMED BY THE GENERAL EXCITEMENT AND HAD FELT SUNDRY MANLY IMPULSES TO UP AND AT EM WHEN HIS COMRADES IN THE SHOP DISCUSSED THE CRISIS WITH IREFUL BRANDISHING OF AWLS AND VENGEFUL POUNDING OF SOLE LEATHER AS IF THE REBELS WERE UNDER THE HAMMER
lbi-3853-163249-0031 TO SAY THAT THE FISH ROSE AT ONCE AND SWALLOWED THE BAIT HOOK AND ALL BUT FEEBLY EXPRESSES THE JUSTICE DONE TO THE CAKES BY THAT LONG SUFFERING MAN
lbi-3853-163249-0032 CAN YOU REMEMBER WHAT HEPSEY TOLD US AND CALL THEM POOR LONG SUFFERIN CREETERS NAMES
lbi-3853-163249-0033 NO HE AIN'T IT'S A TRAINER ADDED ANN LIZY
lbi-3853-163249-0034 NOW CYNTHY BE YOU SATISFIED
lbi-3853-163249-0035 AND THE INCONSISTENT WOMAN FELL UPON HIS BUTTONY BREAST WEEPING COPIOUSLY
lbi-3853-163249-0036 HIS WIFE FED HIM WITH THE FAT OF THE LAND REGARDLESS OF CONSEQUENCES HIS CHILDREN REVOLVED ABOUT HIM WITH TIRELESS CURIOSITY AND WONDER HIS NEIGHBORS FLOCKED IN TO APPLAUD ADVISE AND ADMIRE EVERY ONE TREATED HIM WITH A RESPECT MOST GRATEFUL TO HIS FEELINGS HE WAS AN OBJECT OF INTEREST AND WITH EVERY HOUR HIS IMPORTANCE INCREASED SO THAT BY NIGHT HE FELT LIKE A COMMANDER IN CHIEF AND BORE HIMSELF ACCORDINGLY
lbi-3853-163249-0037 THEN THE GOOD SOUL OPENLY SHOULDERED THE BURDEN SHE HAD BORNE SO LONG IN SECRET AND BRAVELY TRUDGED ON ALONE
lbi-3853-163249-0038 THE WOMEN DROPPED THEIR WORK TO LOOK AND LISTEN FOR HIS VISITS WERE FEW AND SHORT AND EVERY INSTANT WAS PRECIOUS
lbi-3853-163249-0039 THEY KNEW WHAT IT WAS WITHOUT A WORD MISSUS STERLING CLASPED HER HANDS AND BOWED HER HEAD
lbi-3853-163249-0040 NOW LET'S BE BRAVE AND ENJOY EVERY MINUTE OF IT
lbi-3853-163249-0041 WE WILL WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU DAVY ASKED CHRISTIE WONDERFULLY SUPPORTED BY THE THOUGHT THAT SHE WAS GOING TOO
lbi-3853-163249-0042 AS A MARRIED WOMAN YOU WILL GET ON BETTER AS MY WIFE YOU WILL BE ALLOWED TO COME TO ME IF I NEED YOU AND AS MY HE STOPPED THERE FOR HE COULD NOT ADD AS MY WIDOW YOU WILL HAVE MY PENSION TO SUPPORT YOU
lbi-3853-163249-0043 NOTHING CAN PART US ANY MORE NOT EVEN DEATH FOR LOVE LIKE OURS WILL LAST FOR EVER
lbi-3853-163249-0044 NOT ONE DAVID THAT'S TRUE LOVE CHRISTIE
lbi-3853-163249-0045 THEN THEY STOOD QUITE STILL FOR A TIME AND IN THE SILENCE THE TWO HEARTS TALKED TOGETHER IN THE SWEET LANGUAGE NO TONGUE CAN UTTER
lbi-3853-163249-0046 SURELY I SHALL IF I GIVE YOU AND MYSELF TO THE CAUSE AND I DO IT GLADLY THOUGH I KNOW THAT MY HEART HAS GOT TO ACHE AS IT NEVER HAS ACHED YET WHEN MY COURAGE FAILS AS IT WILL BY AND BY AND MY SELFISH SOUL COUNTS THE COST OF MY OFFERING AFTER THE EXCITEMENT IS OVER
lbi-3853-163249-0047 DAVID CAUGHT THE EXALTATION AND GAVE NO FURTHER THOUGHT TO ANY THING BUT THE DUTY OF THE HOUR FINDING HIMSELF STRONGER AND BRAVER FOR THAT LONG LOOK INTO THE ILLUMINATED FACE OF THE WOMAN HE LOVED
lbi-3853-163249-0048 THE ROSES ARE FOR THEY REMIND ME OF POOR HELEN AND THE FIRST WORK I DID WITH DAVID WAS ARRANGING FLOWERS LIKE THESE FOR A DEAD BABY'S LITTLE COFFIN
lbi-3853-163249-0049 BUT I THINK FEW BRIDES DRESS WITH A BRAVER HAPPIER HEART THAN MINE THOUGH I DO CHOOSE A SOBER WEDDING GOWN ANSWERED CHRISTIE SMILING AGAIN AS SHE TOOK FROM A HALF PACKED TRUNK HER NEW HOSPITAL SUIT OF SOFT GRAY WOOLLEN STUFF
lbi-3853-163249-0050 MISTER POWER IS WAITING ARE YOU READY LOVE QUITE READY
lbi-3853-163249-0051 YOU YOUNG FOLKS TAKE A WEDDING TRIP TO THE GREEN HOUSE WHILE WE SEE HOW WELL WE CAN GET ON WITHOUT YOU
lbi-3853-163249-0052 DAVID AND CHRISTIE WENT SMILING AWAY TOGETHER AND IF THEY SHED ANY TEARS OVER THE BRIEF HAPPINESS NO ONE SAW THEM BUT THE FLOWERS AND THEY LOYALLY KEPT THE SECRET FOLDED UP IN THEIR TENDER HEARTS
lbi-3853-163249-0053 A VERY SIMPLE LITTLE MARRIAGE FEAST BUT MORE LOVE GOOD WILL AND TENDER WISHES ADORNED THE PLAIN TABLE THAN IS OFTEN FOUND AT WEDDING BREAKFASTS AND BETTER THAN ANY SPEECH OR SONG WAS LETTY'S BROKEN WHISPER AS SHE FOLDED HER ARMS ROUND DAVID'S EMPTY CHAIR WHEN NO ONE SAW HER HEAVEN BLESS AND KEEP AND BRING HIM BACK TO US
lbi-3853-163249-0054 ALL WATCHED WITH QUICKENED BREATH AND PROUD SOULS THAT LIVING WAVE BLUE BELOW AND BRIGHT WITH A STEELY GLITTER ABOVE AS IT FLOWED DOWN THE STREET AND AWAY TO JOIN THE SEA OF DAUNTLESS HEARTS THAT FOR MONTHS HAD ROLLED UP AGAINST THE SOUTH AND EBBED BACK REDDENED WITH THE BLOOD OF MEN LIKE THESE
lbi-3853-163249-0055 THEN SHE SAW DAVID AND THE REGIMENT BECAME ONE MAN TO HER
lbi-3853-163249-0056 I COULD NOT LOVE THEE DEAR SO MUCH LOVED I NOT HONOR MORE
lbi-422-122949-0000 EVERY ELEVATION OF THE TYPE MAN HAS HITHERTO BEEN THE WORK OF AN ARISTOCRATIC SOCIETY AND SO IT WILL ALWAYS BE A SOCIETY BELIEVING IN A LONG SCALE OF GRADATIONS OF RANK AND DIFFERENCES OF WORTH AMONG HUMAN BEINGS AND REQUIRING SLAVERY IN SOME FORM OR OTHER
lbi-422-122949-0001 THE DISTINCTIONS OF MORAL VALUES HAVE EITHER ORIGINATED IN A RULING CASTE PLEASANTLY CONSCIOUS OF BEING DIFFERENT FROM THE RULED OR AMONG THE RULED CLASS THE SLAVES AND DEPENDENTS OF ALL SORTS
lbi-422-122949-0002 WE TRUTHFUL ONES THE NOBILITY IN ANCIENT GREECE CALLED THEMSELVES
lbi-422-122949-0003 IT IS OBVIOUS THAT EVERYWHERE THE DESIGNATIONS OF MORAL VALUE WERE AT FIRST APPLIED TO MEN AND WERE ONLY DERIVATIVELY AND AT A LATER PERIOD APPLIED TO ACTIONS IT IS A GROSS MISTAKE THEREFORE WHEN HISTORIANS OF MORALS START WITH QUESTIONS LIKE WHY HAVE SYMPATHETIC ACTIONS BEEN PRAISED
lbi-422-122949-0004 HE HONOURS WHATEVER HE RECOGNIZES IN HIMSELF SUCH MORALITY EQUALS SELF GLORIFICATION
lbi-422-122949-0005 PROBABLY A PESSIMISTIC SUSPICION WITH REGARD TO THE ENTIRE SITUATION OF MAN WILL FIND EXPRESSION PERHAPS A CONDEMNATION OF MAN TOGETHER WITH HIS SITUATION
lbi-422-122949-0006 HERE IS THE SEAT OF THE ORIGIN OF THE FAMOUS ANTITHESIS GOOD AND EVIL POWER AND DANGEROUSNESS ARE ASSUMED TO RESIDE IN THE EVIL A CERTAIN DREADFULNESS SUBTLETY AND STRENGTH WHICH DO NOT ADMIT OF BEING DESPISED
lbi-422-122949-0007 ACCORDING TO SLAVE MORALITY THEREFORE THE EVIL MAN AROUSES FEAR ACCORDING TO MASTER MORALITY IT IS PRECISELY THE GOOD MAN WHO AROUSES FEAR AND SEEKS TO AROUSE IT WHILE THE BAD MAN IS REGARDED AS THE DESPICABLE BEING
lbi-422-122949-0008 EVERYWHERE THAT SLAVE MORALITY GAINS THE ASCENDANCY LANGUAGE SHOWS A TENDENCY TO APPROXIMATE THE SIGNIFICATIONS OF THE WORDS GOOD AND STUPID
lbi-422-122949-0009 OR HE WILL EVEN SAY FOR MANY REASONS I CAN DELIGHT IN THE GOOD OPINION OF OTHERS PERHAPS BECAUSE I LOVE AND HONOUR THEM AND REJOICE IN ALL THEIR JOYS PERHAPS ALSO BECAUSE THEIR GOOD OPINION ENDORSES AND STRENGTHENS MY BELIEF IN MY OWN GOOD OPINION PERHAPS BECAUSE THE GOOD OPINION OF OTHERS EVEN IN CASES WHERE I DO NOT SHARE IT IS USEFUL TO ME OR GIVES PROMISE OF USEFULNESS ALL THIS HOWEVER IS NOT VANITY
lbi-422-122949-0010 IN FACT CONFORMABLY TO THE SLOW RISE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIAL ORDER AND ITS CAUSE THE BLENDING OF THE BLOOD OF MASTERS AND SLAVES THE ORIGINALLY NOBLE AND RARE IMPULSE OF THE MASTERS TO ASSIGN A VALUE TO THEMSELVES AND TO THINK WELL OF THEMSELVES WILL NOW BE MORE AND MORE ENCOURAGED AND EXTENDED BUT IT HAS AT ALL TIMES AN OLDER AMPLER AND MORE RADICALLY INGRAINED PROPENSITY OPPOSED TO IT AND IN THE PHENOMENON OF VANITY THIS OLDER PROPENSITY OVERMASTERS THE YOUNGER
lbi-422-122949-0011 THE MOST VARIED EXPERIENCE TEACHES IT WHAT ARE THE QUALITIES TO WHICH IT PRINCIPALLY OWES THE FACT THAT IT STILL EXISTS IN SPITE OF ALL GODS AND MEN AND HAS HITHERTO BEEN VICTORIOUS THESE QUALITIES IT CALLS VIRTUES AND THESE VIRTUES ALONE IT DEVELOPS TO MATURITY
lbi-422-122949-0012 VARIATIONS WHETHER THEY BE DEVIATIONS INTO THE HIGHER FINER AND RARER OR DETERIORATIONS AND MONSTROSITIES APPEAR SUDDENLY ON THE SCENE IN THE GREATEST EXUBERANCE AND SPLENDOUR THE INDIVIDUAL DARES TO BE INDIVIDUAL AND DETACH HIMSELF
lbi-422-122949-0013 AT THIS TURNING POINT OF HISTORY THERE MANIFEST THEMSELVES SIDE BY SIDE AND OFTEN MIXED AND ENTANGLED TOGETHER A MAGNIFICENT MANIFOLD VIRGIN FOREST LIKE UP GROWTH AND UP STRIVING A KIND OF TROPICAL TEMPO IN THE RIVALRY OF GROWTH AND AN EXTRAORDINARY DECAY AND SELF DESTRUCTION OWING TO THE SAVAGELY OPPOSING AND SEEMINGLY EXPLODING EGOISMS WHICH STRIVE WITH ONE ANOTHER FOR SUN AND LIGHT AND CAN NO LONGER ASSIGN ANY LIMIT RESTRAINT OR FORBEARANCE FOR THEMSELVES BY MEANS OF THE HITHERTO EXISTING MORALITY
lbi-422-122949-0014 NOTHING BUT NEW WHYS NOTHING BUT NEW HOWS NO COMMON FORMULAS ANY LONGER MISUNDERSTANDING AND DISREGARD IN LEAGUE WITH EACH OTHER DECAY DETERIORATION AND THE LOFTIEST DESIRES FRIGHTFULLY ENTANGLED THE GENIUS OF THE RACE OVERFLOWING FROM ALL THE CORNUCOPIAS OF GOOD AND BAD A PORTENTOUS SIMULTANEOUSNESS OF SPRING AND AUTUMN FULL OF NEW CHARMS AND MYSTERIES PECULIAR TO THE FRESH STILL INEXHAUSTED STILL UNWEARIED CORRUPTION
lbi-422-122949-0015 DANGER IS AGAIN PRESENT THE MOTHER OF MORALITY GREAT DANGER THIS TIME SHIFTED INTO THE INDIVIDUAL INTO THE NEIGHBOUR AND FRIEND INTO THE STREET INTO THEIR OWN CHILD INTO THEIR OWN HEART INTO ALL THE MOST PERSONAL AND SECRET RECESSES OF THEIR DESIRES AND VOLITIONS
lbi-422-122949-0016 WHAT WILL THE MORAL PHILOSOPHERS WHO APPEAR AT THIS TIME HAVE TO PREACH
lbi-422-122949-0017 THIS IS THE PROBLEM OF RACE
lbi-422-122949-0018 IN OUR VERY DEMOCRATIC OR RATHER VERY PLEBEIAN AGE EDUCATION AND CULTURE MUST BE ESSENTIALLY THE ART OF DECEIVING DECEIVING WITH REGARD TO ORIGIN WITH REGARD TO THE INHERITED PLEBEIANISM IN BODY AND SOUL
lbi-422-122949-0019 THE NOBLE SOUL ACCEPTS THE FACT OF HIS EGOISM WITHOUT QUESTION AND ALSO WITHOUT CONSCIOUSNESS OF HARSHNESS CONSTRAINT OR ARBITRARINESS THEREIN BUT RATHER AS SOMETHING THAT MAY HAVE ITS BASIS IN THE PRIMARY LAW OF THINGS IF HE SOUGHT A DESIGNATION FOR IT HE WOULD SAY IT IS JUSTICE ITSELF
lbi-422-122949-0020 ON THIS ACCOUNT THE PEOPLE OF ONE NATION UNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER BETTER THAN THOSE BELONGING TO DIFFERENT NATIONS EVEN WHEN THEY USE THE SAME LANGUAGE OR RATHER WHEN PEOPLE HAVE LIVED LONG TOGETHER UNDER SIMILAR CONDITIONS OF CLIMATE SOIL DANGER REQUIREMENT TOIL THERE ORIGINATES THEREFROM AN ENTITY THAT UNDERSTANDS ITSELF NAMELY A NATION
lbi-422-122949-0021 THE GREATER THE DANGER THE GREATER IS THE NEED OF AGREEING QUICKLY AND READILY ABOUT WHAT IS NECESSARY NOT TO MISUNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER IN DANGER THAT IS WHAT CANNOT AT ALL BE DISPENSED WITH IN INTERCOURSE
lbi-422-122949-0022 ALSO IN ALL LOVES AND FRIENDSHIPS ONE HAS THE EXPERIENCE THAT NOTHING OF THE KIND CONTINUES WHEN THE DISCOVERY HAS BEEN MADE THAT IN USING THE SAME WORDS ONE OF THE TWO PARTIES HAS FEELINGS THOUGHTS INTUITIONS WISHES OR FEARS DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF THE OTHER
lbi-422-122949-0023 WHICHEVER GROUPS OF SENSATIONS WITHIN A SOUL AWAKEN MOST READILY BEGIN TO SPEAK AND GIVE THE WORD OF COMMAND THESE DECIDE AS TO THE GENERAL ORDER OF RANK OF ITS VALUES AND DETERMINE ULTIMATELY ITS LIST OF DESIRABLE THINGS
lbi-422-122949-0024 A MAN'S ESTIMATES OF VALUE BETRAY SOMETHING OF THE STRUCTURE OF HIS SOUL AND WHEREIN IT SEES ITS CONDITIONS OF LIFE ITS INTRINSIC NEEDS
lbi-422-122949-0025 PROFOUND SUFFERING MAKES NOBLE IT SEPARATES ONE OF THE MOST REFINED FORMS OF DISGUISE IS EPICURISM ALONG WITH A CERTAIN OSTENTATIOUS BOLDNESS OF TASTE WHICH TAKES SUFFERING LIGHTLY AND PUTS ITSELF ON THE DEFENSIVE AGAINST ALL THAT IS SORROWFUL AND PROFOUND
lbi-422-122949-0026 THE HIGHEST INSTINCT FOR PURITY PLACES HIM WHO IS AFFECTED WITH IT IN THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY AND DANGEROUS ISOLATION AS A SAINT FOR IT IS JUST HOLINESS THE HIGHEST SPIRITUALIZATION OF THE INSTINCT IN QUESTION
lbi-422-122949-0027 OCCASIONALLY TOO THE WAKING CALL COMES TOO LATE THE CHANCE WHICH GIVES PERMISSION TO TAKE ACTION WHEN THEIR BEST YOUTH AND STRENGTH FOR ACTION HAVE BEEN USED UP IN SITTING STILL AND HOW MANY A ONE JUST AS HE SPRANG UP HAS FOUND WITH HORROR THAT HIS LIMBS ARE BENUMBED AND HIS SPIRITS ARE NOW TOO HEAVY
lbi-422-122949-0028 AND WHOEVER THOU ART WHAT IS IT THAT NOW PLEASES THEE
lbi-422-122949-0029 ONLY NAME IT WHATEVER I HAVE I OFFER THEE
lbi-422-122949-0030 BUT YOU MISUNDERSTAND HIM WHEN YOU COMPLAIN ABOUT IT
lbi-422-122949-0031 THERE MUST BE A SORT OF REPUGNANCE IN ME TO BELIEVE ANYTHING DEFINITE ABOUT MYSELF IS THERE PERHAPS SOME ENIGMA THEREIN
lbi-422-122949-0032 PROBABLY BUT FORTUNATELY NOTHING FOR MY OWN TEETH PERHAPS IT BETRAYS THE SPECIES TO WHICH I BELONG BUT NOT TO MYSELF AS IS SUFFICIENTLY AGREEABLE TO ME BUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO YOU
lbi-422-122949-0033 I DO NOT KNOW HE SAID HESITATINGLY PERHAPS THE HARPIES HAVE FLOWN OVER MY TABLE
lbi-422-122949-0034 TO SUFFOCATE WITH HIS MEMORIES TO HIM WHO HAS THE DESIRES OF A LOFTY AND DAINTY SOUL AND ONLY SELDOM FINDS HIS TABLE LAID AND HIS FOOD PREPARED THE DANGER WILL ALWAYS BE GREAT NOWADAYS HOWEVER IT IS EXTRAORDINARILY SO
lbi-422-122949-0035 AND TO CHOOSE FOR COMPANY THAT ROGUISH AND CHEERFUL VICE POLITENESS
