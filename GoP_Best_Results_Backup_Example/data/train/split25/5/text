007390013	BUT IT CERTAINLY IS POSSIBLE
007390019	THE WOLFS WERE NOT QUITE AS BAD
007390062	IT WAS A TOUGH POSITION TO BE IN
007390070	IT'S ABOUT WHAT KIND OF LIVES AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL LEAD
007390072	AND IT'S AGAINST THE LAW
007390092	IT SHOULD BE LOST OF RUN
007390119	NOTHING TO DO WITH HAVING A BABY
007390120	I HAVE NO TIME FOR GUESSING
007390139	IT'S MONDAY IN MY NECK OF THE WOODS
007390160	I'M MORE THAN WHAT THEM WANT TO BELIEVE
007390195	IT WALL DEPENDS ON WHAT IS IN OUR HEARTS
007390197	I SHAME TO BE THE ONLY ONE
007390208	LET US KNOW WHAT YOU THINK OF IT
007390211	LOST AN HOUR OF SLEEP
007390220	NOTHING WILL KEEP ME AWAY FROM THIS MUSIC
007390228	DO WE NEED TO SAY EVERYTHING
007390238	TIME TO PUT YOUR MIND THE TEST
007390281	IT'S A VERY AMERICAN VIEW
007390294	BEAT THE TIGER FOR US
007390355	BUT WE MUST SPEAK FURTHER OF IN HIS SONGS
008130061	IT WAS JUST LIKE A SPRING TRAINING PLAY
008130081	THE JAZZ WERE UNABLE TO GET OFF A FINAL SHOT
008130091	THREE OF THE VICTIMS WERE LISTED IN SERIOUS CONDITION
008130100	BUT I WOULD IF HE WERE THE BEST PLAYER
008130153	LOVE IS IN THE BUILDING
008130196	I JUST WANT TO BE THERE
008130222	YOU DIG HELP MAKE IT HAPPEN
008130233	WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO KEEP IT
008130257	BUT IT IS GOOD ALONE
008130271	WE WILL HAVE TO AGREE TO DISAGREE
008130281	ESPECIALLY AFTER A LONG SESSION
008130282	I'M SO LUCKY TO LIVE IN SUCH A BEAUTIFUL PLACE
008130283	LITTLE TOO MUCH TIME ON MY HANDS TODAY
008130288	THINGS ARE ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE FROM HERE
008130301	BUT HE WANTS TO COME SOONER
008130339	THE GIRL WAS FOUR AT THE TIME
008130340	OH IT IS RICH TO SEE AND HEAR HER
008130346	IT WAS A SUFFICIENT ANSWER
008130356	AND THEN HE WILL TAKE IT
008130380	I BEG TO KNOW IF SUCH WERE THE FACT
009600062	THE GAME IS FILLED WITH THIS
009600113	HE'S UP AGAINST SOMETHING THAT IS NOT GOING TO YIELD
009600118	IS IT POSSIBLE YOU ARE IN THE WRONG ACCOUNT
009600120	JUST A PIECE OF TODAY
009600127	THE ONLY THING YOU NEED TO SEE TODAY
009600129	NEED TO INVEST IN YOUR FUTURE
009600133	BUT WERE DEPENDENCE ON THE IMPORTANCE OF THE GAME
009600140	IT'S GOOD TO BE THE CAPTAIN
009600186	FEEL FOR HIS WIFE AND SONGS
009600190	ONCE YOU LOSE THE PASSION IT IS A WRAP
009600205	IS LOOKING FORWARD TO THE TENNIS TOMORROW
009600215	DAY ONE IN THE BAG
009600262	IT'S GOOD TO BE WHITE
009600267	YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW WRONG YOU ARE
009600270	THINKING OF HIS FAMILY AND FRIENDS
009600287	I KNOW I AM GOING TO BED
009600335	AND THIS IS MY OPINION AND IT'S A FINAL ONE
009600337	I MADE HIS ACQUAINTANCE HERE
009600338	THE NEXT STOP WAS AT THE MUSEUM
009600343	WHAT A DAY FOR A BATHE
010120008	IT'S SOMETHING TO WATCH FOR
010120059	HE ALLOWED FIVE WRONGS AND EIGHT HITS OVER FIVE INNINGS
010120071	I WAS ALL OVER HIM IN THE SECOND SET
010120128	HE'S A DOCTOR OF EVERYTHING
010120148	I HAVE A FEELING THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING
010120166	I THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT TO BE
010120180	I GO WITH THE FOLLOW
010120193	WELCOME TO THE NEW BOSS
010120200	YOU WILL FEEL A LOT OF PAIN
010120208	JUST GETTING READY TO GO OUT AND YOU
010120212	NOT IN THE MOOD OF ANY OF THEM
010120219	DO YOU THINK IT WILL BE CONFIRMED
010120243	IT'S BASED OF WHAT HAPPENED TO ME AND MY COUSIN
010120255	HE TRYING TO GET BACK IN THE HOUSE
010120265	IRON BANNER CONTROL IS BACK
010120269	SPENDING TOO MUCH TIME ON A GAME
010120303	DOING THE LITTLE THINGS CAN MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE
010120334	I HAD JUST COME IN FROM THE STREET
010120335	IT WAS SO WELL PRINTED ON SUCH GOOD PAPER
010120374	THAT WAS DIFFICULT TO SAY
010270117	YELL THE VERY SAME THING
010270124	HOW CAN THEY BE ALLOWED TO TRADE
010270131	TIME TO BUY A NEW HOME
010270140	WE HAVE TO GET IT OUT OF OR CULTURE
010270170	YOU COMING BACK FOR THE GAMES
010270198	SOME OF US ARE NOT HERE TO BE LOVED
010270226	THAT SEEMS TO WORK FOR THEM
010270238	MAYBE THIS WILL BE THE DAY
010270265	THIS IS NOT A SERIOUS PROBLEM
010270268	I WANT TO BE ABLE TO START MY OWN PROJECTS
010270294	AND YES AT THE SAME TIME
010270301	YOU HAVE TO LEAVE THE HOUSE PLEASE
010270306	THEN HE RETURNED TO HER AND DEMANDED SOMETHING TO EAT
010270314	HE WANTED ME ON THIS JOB
010270349	THE UNCLE MUST BE VERY RICH INDEED
010270354	I THINK IT'S QUITE PROPER
010270356	HERE WE ARE CAUGHT JUST AS THEY WERE BEFORE
010270366	IT WAS A TREAT TO SEE HER AT HER WORK
010270368	HER EYES MY DEAR BOY ARE SO BEAUTIFUL
010270377	AND THEY WOULD GET A FORMAL END TO THE CONFLICT
