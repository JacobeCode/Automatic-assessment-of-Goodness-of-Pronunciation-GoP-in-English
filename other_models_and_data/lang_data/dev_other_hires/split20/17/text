lbi-700-122866-0000 JUNIOR AVONLEA FOUND IT HARD TO SETTLE DOWN TO HUMDRUM EXISTENCE AGAIN
lbi-700-122866-0001 PERHAPS AFTER A WHILE I'LL GET USED TO IT BUT I'M AFRAID CONCERTS SPOIL PEOPLE FOR EVERYDAY LIFE
lbi-700-122866-0002 I SUPPOSE THAT IS WHY MARILLA DISAPPROVES OF THEM
lbi-700-122866-0003 I FEEL JUST NOW THAT I MAY GROW UP TO BE SENSIBLE YET
lbi-700-122866-0004 I JUST LAY AWAKE AND IMAGINED THE CONCERT OVER AND OVER AGAIN
lbi-700-122866-0005 EVENTUALLY HOWEVER AVONLEA SCHOOL SLIPPED BACK INTO ITS OLD GROOVE AND TOOK UP ITS OLD INTERESTS
lbi-700-122866-0006 NONE OF THE SLOANES WOULD HAVE ANY DEALINGS WITH THE BELLS BECAUSE THE BELLS HAD DECLARED THAT THE SLOANES HAD TOO MUCH TO DO IN THE PROGRAM AND THE SLOANES HAD RETORTED THAT THE BELLS WERE NOT CAPABLE OF DOING THE LITTLE THEY HAD TO DO PROPERLY
lbi-700-122866-0007 THE WINTER WEEKS SLIPPED BY
lbi-700-122866-0008 ON ANNE'S BIRTHDAY THEY WERE TRIPPING LIGHTLY DOWN IT KEEPING EYES AND EARS ALERT AMID ALL THEIR CHATTER FOR MISS STACY HAD TOLD THEM THAT THEY MUST SOON WRITE A COMPOSITION ON A WINTER'S WALK IN THE WOODS AND IT BEHOOVED THEM TO BE OBSERVANT
lbi-700-122866-0009 I CAN SCARCELY REALIZE THAT I'M IN MY TEENS
lbi-700-122866-0010 IT'S A GREAT COMFORT TO THINK THAT I'LL BE ABLE TO USE BIG WORDS THEN WITHOUT BEING LAUGHED AT
lbi-700-122866-0011 RUBY GILLIS THINKS OF NOTHING BUT BEAUS SAID ANNE DISDAINFULLY
lbi-700-122866-0012 SHE'S ACTUALLY DELIGHTED WHEN ANYONE WRITES HER NAME UP IN A TAKE NOTICE FOR ALL SHE PRETENDS TO BE SO MAD
lbi-700-122866-0013 I'M TRYING TO BE AS MUCH LIKE MISSUS ALLAN AS I POSSIBLY CAN FOR I THINK SHE'S PERFECT
lbi-700-122866-0014 IF I HAD ALICE BELL'S CROOKED NOSE SAID ANNE DECIDEDLY I WOULDN'T BUT THERE
lbi-700-122866-0015 I'M AFRAID I THINK TOO MUCH ABOUT MY NOSE EVER SINCE I HEARD THAT COMPLIMENT ABOUT IT LONG AGO
lbi-700-122866-0016 OH DIANA LOOK THERE'S A RABBIT
lbi-700-122866-0017 THEY'RE SO WHITE AND STILL AS IF THEY WERE ASLEEP AND DREAMING PRETTY DREAMS
lbi-700-122866-0018 I WROTE IT LAST MONDAY EVENING
lbi-700-122866-0019 IT'S CALLED THE JEALOUS RIVAL OR IN DEATH NOT DIVIDED
lbi-700-122866-0020 I READ IT TO MARILLA AND SHE SAID IT WAS STUFF AND NONSENSE
lbi-700-122866-0021 IT'S A SAD SWEET STORY
lbi-700-122866-0022 CORDELIA WAS A REGAL BRUNETTE WITH A CORONET OF MIDNIGHT HAIR AND DUSKLY FLASHING EYES
lbi-700-122866-0023 YOU KNOW SO MUCH MORE THAN YOU DID WHEN YOU WERE ONLY TWELVE
lbi-700-122866-0024 THEY GREW IN BEAUTY SIDE BY SIDE UNTIL THEY WERE SIXTEEN
lbi-700-122866-0025 I ASKED RUBY GILLIS IF SHE KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT HOW MEN PROPOSED BECAUSE I THOUGHT SHE'D LIKELY BE AN AUTHORITY ON THE SUBJECT HAVING SO MANY SISTERS MARRIED
lbi-700-122866-0026 BUT SHE PRETENDED TO BE GERALDINE'S FRIEND THE SAME AS EVER
lbi-700-122866-0027 LET YOU AND ME HAVE A STORY CLUB ALL OUR OWN AND WRITE STORIES FOR PRACTICE
lbi-700-122866-0028 YOU OUGHT TO CULTIVATE YOUR IMAGINATION YOU KNOW MISS STACY SAYS SO
lbi-700-122866-0029 ONLY WE MUST TAKE THE RIGHT WAY
lbi-700-122866-0030 THIS WAS HOW THE STORY CLUB CAME INTO EXISTENCE
lbi-700-122866-0031 NO BOYS WERE ALLOWED IN IT ALTHOUGH RUBY GILLIS OPINED THAT THEIR ADMISSION WOULD MAKE IT MORE EXCITING AND EACH MEMBER HAD TO PRODUCE ONE STORY A WEEK
lbi-700-122866-0032 EACH GIRL HAS TO READ HER STORY OUT LOUD AND THEN WE TALK IT OVER
lbi-700-122866-0033 MINE IS ROSAMOND MONTMORENCY ALL THE GIRLS DO PRETTY WELL
lbi-700-122866-0034 I'M SURE THAT MUST HAVE A WHOLESOME EFFECT
lbi-700-122866-0035 THE MORAL IS THE GREAT THING MISTER ALLAN SAYS SO
lbi-700-122866-0036 I READ ONE OF MY STORIES TO HIM AND MISSUS ALLAN AND THEY BOTH AGREED THAT THE MORAL WAS EXCELLENT
lbi-700-122866-0037 JANE AND RUBY ALMOST ALWAYS CRY WHEN I COME TO THE PATHETIC PARTS
lbi-700-122866-0038 MISS JOSEPHINE BARRY WROTE BACK THAT SHE HAD NEVER READ ANYTHING SO AMUSING IN HER LIFE
lbi-700-122866-0039 I'M SURE MISSUS ALLAN WAS NEVER SUCH A SILLY FORGETFUL LITTLE GIRL AS YOU ARE
lbi-700-122866-0040 I FELT SO ENCOURAGED WHEN I HEARD THAT
lbi-700-122866-0041 MISSUS LYNDE SAYS SHE ALWAYS FEELS SHOCKED WHEN SHE HEARS OF ANYONE EVER HAVING BEEN NAUGHTY NO MATTER HOW SMALL THEY WERE
lbi-700-122866-0042 NOW I WOULDN'T HAVE FELT THAT WAY
lbi-700-122867-0000 VANITY AND VEXATION OF SPIRIT
lbi-700-122867-0001 THE SPRING WAS ABROAD IN THE LAND AND MARILLA'S SOBER MIDDLE AGED STEP WAS LIGHTER AND SWIFTER BECAUSE OF ITS DEEP PRIMAL GLADNESS
lbi-700-122867-0002 I MUST SAY WITH ALL HER FAULTS I NEVER FOUND HER DISOBEDIENT OR UNTRUSTWORTHY BEFORE AND I'M REAL SORRY TO FIND HER SO NOW
lbi-700-122867-0003 PERHAPS YOU'RE JUDGING HER TOO HASTY MARILLA
lbi-700-122867-0004 OF COURSE I KNEW YOU'D TAKE HER PART MATTHEW BUT I'M BRINGING HER UP NOT YOU
lbi-700-122867-0005 DEMANDED MARILLA ANXIOUSLY GOING OVER TO THE BED
lbi-700-122867-0006 ANNE COWERED DEEPER INTO HER PILLOWS AS IF DESIROUS OF HIDING HERSELF FOREVER FROM MORTAL EYES NO
lbi-700-122867-0007 GET RIGHT UP THIS MINUTE AND TELL ME
lbi-700-122867-0008 THIS MINUTE I SAY THERE NOW WHAT IS IT
lbi-700-122867-0009 ANNE HAD SLID TO THE FLOOR IN DESPAIRING OBEDIENCE
lbi-700-122867-0010 YES IT'S GREEN MOANED ANNE
lbi-700-122867-0011 I THOUGHT NOTHING COULD BE AS BAD AS RED HAIR
lbi-700-122867-0012 YOU HAVEN'T GOT INTO ANY SCRAPE FOR OVER TWO MONTHS AND I WAS SURE ANOTHER ONE WAS DUE
lbi-700-122867-0013 NOW THEN WHAT DID YOU DO TO YOUR HAIR
lbi-700-122867-0014 ANNE SHIRLEY DIDN'T YOU KNOW IT WAS A WICKED THING TO DO
lbi-700-122867-0015 YES I KNEW IT WAS A LITTLE WICKED ADMITTED ANNE
lbi-700-122867-0016 I KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO HAVE YOUR WORD DOUBTED
lbi-700-122867-0017 AND MISSUS ALLAN SAYS WE SHOULD NEVER SUSPECT ANYONE OF NOT TELLING US THE TRUTH UNLESS WE HAVE PROOF THAT THEY'RE NOT
lbi-700-122867-0018 BUT I HADN'T THEN AND I BELIEVED EVERY WORD HE SAID IMPLICITLY
lbi-700-122867-0019 WHO SAID WHO ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
lbi-700-122867-0020 OH I DIDN'T LET HIM IN THE HOUSE
lbi-700-122867-0021 IN A TRICE I SAW MYSELF WITH BEAUTIFUL RAVEN BLACK HAIR AND THE TEMPTATION WAS IRRESISTIBLE
lbi-700-122867-0022 OH MARILLA WHAT A TANGLED WEB WE WEAVE WHEN FIRST WE PRACTICE TO DECEIVE
lbi-700-122867-0023 YOUR HAIR MUST BE CUT OFF THERE IS NO OTHER WAY YOU CAN'T GO OUT WITH IT LOOKING LIKE THAT
lbi-700-122867-0024 WITH A DISMAL SIGH SHE WENT FOR THE SCISSORS
lbi-700-122867-0025 BUT THERE IS NOTHING COMFORTING IN HAVING YOUR HAIR CUT OFF BECAUSE YOU'VE DYED IT A DREADFUL COLOR IS THERE
lbi-700-122867-0026 I'M GOING TO WEEP ALL THE TIME YOU'RE CUTTING IT OFF IF IT WON'T INTERFERE
lbi-700-122867-0027 IT SEEMS SUCH A TRAGIC THING
lbi-700-122867-0028 ANNE WEPT THEN BUT LATER ON WHEN SHE WENT UPSTAIRS AND LOOKED IN THE GLASS SHE WAS CALM WITH DESPAIR
lbi-700-122867-0029 YES I WILL TOO
lbi-700-122867-0030 I NEVER THOUGHT I WAS VAIN ABOUT MY HAIR OF ALL THINGS BUT NOW I KNOW I WAS IN SPITE OF ITS BEING RED BECAUSE IT WAS SO LONG AND THICK AND CURLY
lbi-700-122867-0031 I EXPECT SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN TO MY NOSE NEXT
lbi-700-122867-0032 ANNE'S CLIPPED HEAD MADE A SENSATION IN SCHOOL ON THE FOLLOWING MONDAY BUT TO HER RELIEF NOBODY GUESSED THE REAL REASON FOR IT NOT EVEN JOSIE PYE WHO HOWEVER DID NOT FAIL TO INFORM ANNE THAT SHE LOOKED LIKE A PERFECT SCARECROW
lbi-700-122867-0033 IT'S HARD TO BE TOLD YOU LOOK LIKE A SCARECROW AND I WANTED TO SAY SOMETHING BACK BUT I DIDN'T
lbi-700-122867-0034 IT MAKES YOU FEEL VERY VIRTUOUS WHEN YOU FORGIVE PEOPLE DOESN'T IT
lbi-700-122867-0035 I MEAN TO DEVOTE ALL MY ENERGIES TO BEING GOOD AFTER THIS AND I SHALL NEVER TRY TO BE BEAUTIFUL AGAIN
lbi-700-122867-0036 OF COURSE IT'S BETTER TO BE GOOD
lbi-700-122867-0037 I DO REALLY WANT TO BE GOOD MARILLA LIKE YOU AND MISSUS ALLAN AND MISS STACY AND GROW UP TO BE A CREDIT TO YOU
lbi-700-122867-0038 DIANA SAYS WHEN MY HAIR BEGINS TO GROW TO TIE A BLACK VELVET RIBBON AROUND MY HEAD WITH A BOW AT ONE SIDE
lbi-700-122867-0039 I WILL CALL IT A SNOOD THAT SOUNDS SO ROMANTIC
lbi-700-122867-0040 MY HEAD IS BETTER NOW
lbi-700-122867-0041 IT WAS TERRIBLE BAD THIS AFTERNOON THOUGH
lbi-700-122868-0000 OF COURSE YOU MUST BE ELAINE ANNE SAID DIANA
lbi-700-122868-0001 OF COURSE IT WOULD BE ROMANTIC CONCEDED JANE ANDREWS BUT I KNOW I COULDN'T KEEP STILL
lbi-700-122868-0002 BUT IT'S SO RIDICULOUS TO HAVE A REDHEADED ELAINE MOURNED ANNE
lbi-700-122868-0003 AND ELAINE WAS THE LILY MAID
lbi-700-122868-0004 YOUR COMPLEXION IS JUST AS FAIR AS RUBY'S SAID DIANA EARNESTLY AND YOUR HAIR IS EVER SO MUCH DARKER THAN IT USED TO BE BEFORE YOU CUT IT
lbi-700-122868-0005 IT WAS SPLENDID TO FISH FOR TROUT OVER THE BRIDGE AND THE TWO GIRLS LEARNED TO ROW THEMSELVES ABOUT IN THE LITTLE FLAT BOTTOMED DORY MISTER BARRY KEPT FOR DUCK SHOOTING
lbi-700-122868-0006 IT WAS ANNE'S IDEA THAT THEY DRAMATIZE ELAINE
lbi-700-122868-0007 THOSE DAYS SHE SAID WERE SO MUCH MORE ROMANTIC THAN THE PRESENT
lbi-700-122868-0008 THEY HAD OFTEN GONE DOWN LIKE THIS AND NOTHING COULD BE MORE CONVENIENT FOR PLAYING ELAINE
lbi-700-122868-0009 THE BLACK SHAWL HAVING BEEN PROCURED ANNE SPREAD IT OVER THE FLAT AND THEN LAY DOWN ON THE BOTTOM WITH CLOSED EYES AND HANDS FOLDED OVER HER BREAST
lbi-700-122868-0010 IT SPOILS THE EFFECT BECAUSE THIS IS HUNDREDS OF YEARS BEFORE MISSUS LYNDE WAS BORN
lbi-700-122868-0011 JANE YOU ARRANGE THIS
lbi-700-122868-0012 IT'S SILLY FOR ELAINE TO BE TALKING WHEN SHE'S DEAD
lbi-700-122868-0013 JANE ROSE TO THE OCCASION
lbi-700-122868-0014 LEFT BEHIND AT THE LANDING
lbi-700-122868-0015 ANNE GAVE ONE GASPING LITTLE SCREAM WHICH NOBODY EVER HEARD SHE WAS WHITE TO THE LIPS BUT SHE DID NOT LOSE HER SELF POSSESSION
lbi-700-122868-0016 THERE WAS ONE CHANCE JUST ONE
lbi-700-122868-0017 UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES YOU DON'T THINK MUCH ABOUT MAKING A FLOWERY PRAYER
lbi-700-122868-0018 THE FLAT DRIFTED UNDER THE BRIDGE AND THEN PROMPTLY SANK IN MIDSTREAM
lbi-700-122868-0019 RUBY JANE AND DIANA ALREADY AWAITING IT ON THE LOWER HEADLAND SAW IT DISAPPEAR BEFORE THEIR VERY EYES AND HAD NOT A DOUBT BUT THAT ANNE HAD GONE DOWN WITH IT
lbi-700-122868-0020 THE MINUTES PASSED BY EACH SEEMING AN HOUR TO THE UNFORTUNATE LILY MAID
lbi-700-122868-0021 WHY DIDN'T SOMEBODY COME WHERE HAD THE GIRLS GONE
lbi-700-122868-0022 HER IMAGINATION BEGAN TO SUGGEST ALL MANNER OF GRUESOME POSSIBILITIES TO HER
lbi-700-122868-0023 ANNE SHIRLEY
lbi-700-122868-0024 HOW ON EARTH DID YOU GET THERE HE EXCLAIMED
lbi-700-122868-0025 IT WAS CERTAINLY EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO BE DIGNIFIED UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES
lbi-700-122868-0026 WHAT HAS HAPPENED ANNE
lbi-700-122868-0027 ASKED GILBERT TAKING UP HIS OARS
lbi-700-122868-0028 WE WERE PLAYING ELAINE EXPLAINED ANNE FRIGIDLY WITHOUT EVEN LOOKING AT HER RESCUER AND I HAD TO DRIFT DOWN TO CAMELOT IN THE BARGE I MEAN THE FLAT
lbi-700-122868-0029 FOR A MOMENT ANNE HESITATED
lbi-700-122868-0030 HER HEART GAVE A QUICK QUEER LITTLE BEAT
lbi-700-122868-0031 HER RESENTMENT WHICH TO OTHER AND OLDER PEOPLE MIGHT BE AS LAUGHABLE AS ITS CAUSE WAS IN NO WHIT ALLAYED AND SOFTENED BY TIME SEEMINGLY
lbi-700-122868-0032 NO SHE SAID COLDLY I SHALL NEVER BE FRIENDS WITH YOU GILBERT BLYTHE AND I DON'T WANT TO BE
lbi-700-122868-0033 ALL RIGHT
lbi-700-122868-0034 I'LL NEVER ASK YOU TO BE FRIENDS AGAIN ANNE SHIRLEY AND I DON'T CARE EITHER
lbi-700-122868-0035 OF COURSE HE HAD INSULTED HER TERRIBLY BUT STILL
lbi-700-122868-0036 EVERYTHING I DO GETS ME OR MY DEAREST FRIENDS INTO A SCRAPE
lbi-700-122868-0037 ANNE'S PRESENTIMENT PROVED MORE TRUSTWORTHY THAN PRESENTIMENTS ARE APT TO DO
lbi-700-122868-0038 WILL YOU EVER HAVE ANY SENSE ANNE GROANED MARILLA
lbi-700-122868-0039 I DON'T SEE HOW SAID MARILLA
lbi-700-122868-0040 EVER SINCE I CAME TO GREEN GABLES I'VE BEEN MAKING MISTAKES AND EACH MISTAKE HAS HELPED TO CURE ME OF SOME GREAT SHORTCOMING
lbi-7601-101619-0000 OUR EXTREMEST PLEASURE HAS SOME SORT OF GROANING AND COMPLAINING IN IT WOULD YOU NOT SAY THAT IT IS DYING OF PAIN
lbi-7601-101619-0001 THE HIGHEST AND FULLEST CONTENTMENT OFFERS MORE OF THE GRAVE THAN OF THE MERRY IPSA FELICITAS SE NISI TEMPERAT PREMIT EVEN FELICITY UNLESS IT MODERATE ITSELF OPPRESSES
lbi-7601-101619-0002 SOCRATES SAYS THAT SOME GOD TRIED TO MIX IN ONE MASS AND TO CONFOUND PAIN AND PLEASURE BUT NOT BEING ABLE TO DO IT HE BETHOUGHT HIM AT LEAST TO COUPLE THEM BY THE TAIL METRODORUS SAID THAT IN SORROW THERE IS SOME MIXTURE OF PLEASURE
lbi-7601-101619-0003 NATURE DISCOVERS THIS CONFUSION TO US PAINTERS HOLD THAT THE SAME MOTIONS AND GRIMACES OF THE FACE THAT SERVE FOR WEEPING SERVE FOR LAUGHTER TOO AND INDEED BEFORE THE ONE OR THE OTHER BE FINISHED DO BUT OBSERVE THE PAINTER'S MANNER OF HANDLING AND YOU WILL BE IN DOUBT TO WHICH OF THE TWO THE DESIGN TENDS AND THE EXTREME OF LAUGHTER DOES AT LAST BRING TEARS
lbi-7601-101619-0004 AND THEREFORE COMMON AND LESS SPECULATIVE SOULS ARE FOUND TO BE MORE PROPER FOR AND MORE SUCCESSFUL IN THE MANAGEMENT OF AFFAIRS AND THE ELEVATED AND EXQUISITE OPINIONS OF PHILOSOPHY UNFIT FOR BUSINESS THIS SHARP VIVACITY OF SOUL AND THE SUPPLE AND RESTLESS VOLUBILITY ATTENDING IT DISTURB OUR NEGOTIATIONS
lbi-7601-101619-0005 HE WHO DIVES INTO AND IN HIS INQUISITION COMPREHENDS ALL CIRCUMSTANCES AND CONSEQUENCES HINDERS HIS ELECTION A LITTLE ENGINE WELL HANDLED IS SUFFICIENT FOR EXECUTIONS WHETHER OF LESS OR GREATER WEIGHT
lbi-7601-101622-0000 THE ROMANS BY THIS MEANS ERECTED THEIR COLONIES FOR PERCEIVING THEIR CITY TO GROW IMMEASURABLY POPULOUS THEY EASED IT OF THE MOST UNNECESSARY PEOPLE AND SENT THEM TO INHABIT AND CULTIVATE THE LANDS CONQUERED BY THEM SOMETIMES ALSO THEY PURPOSELY MAINTAINED WARS WITH SOME OF THEIR ENEMIES NOT ONLY TO KEEP THEIR OWN MEN IN ACTION FOR FEAR LEST IDLENESS THE MOTHER OF CORRUPTION SHOULD BRING UPON THEM SOME WORSE INCONVENIENCE
lbi-7601-101622-0001 AND WE SUFFER THE ILLS OF A LONG PEACE LUXURY IS MORE PERNICIOUS THAN WAR
lbi-7601-101622-0002 AND THIS ALSO WAS ONE REASON WHY OUR KING PHILIP CONSENTED TO SEND HIS SON JOHN UPON A FOREIGN EXPEDITION THAT HE MIGHT TAKE ALONG WITH HIM A GREAT NUMBER OF HOT YOUNG MEN WHO WERE THEN IN HIS PAY
lbi-7601-101622-0003 WHAT OTHER END DOES THE IMPIOUS ART OF THE GLADIATORS PROPOSE TO ITSELF WHAT THE SLAUGHTER OF YOUNG MEN WHAT PLEASURE FED WITH BLOOD
lbi-7601-101622-0004 PRINCE TAKE THE HONOURS DELAYED FOR THY REIGN AND BE SUCCESSOR TO THY FATHERS HENCEFORTH LET NONE AT ROME BE SLAIN FOR SPORT
lbi-7601-101622-0005 LET BEASTS BLOOD STAIN THE INFAMOUS ARENA AND NO MORE HOMICIDES BE THERE ACTED
lbi-7601-101622-0006 IT WAS NOT ENOUGH FOR THEM TO FIGHT AND TO DIE BRAVELY BUT CHEERFULLY TOO INSOMUCH THAT THEY WERE HISSED AND CURSED IF THEY MADE ANY HESITATION ABOUT RECEIVING THEIR DEATH
lbi-7601-101622-0007 THE VERY GIRLS THEMSELVES SET THEM ON
lbi-7601-175351-0000 BEGINNING OF REVOLT
lbi-7601-175351-0001 AT THIS UNEXPECTED COMMAND THE SURPRISE WAS GREAT ON BOARD THE FORWARD
lbi-7601-175351-0002 LIGHT THE FIRES EXCLAIMED SOME
lbi-7601-175351-0003 WHAT WITH ASKED OTHERS
lbi-7601-175351-0004 AND STUFF THE STOVE WITH THE MASTS ADDED WARREN
lbi-7601-175351-0005 DID YOU HEAR ME
lbi-7601-175351-0006 WHO SPOKE CRIED HATTERAS
lbi-7601-175351-0007 I DID SAID PEN ADVANCING TOWARDS THE CAPTAIN
lbi-7601-175351-0008 I SAY ANSWERED PEN WITH AN OATH I SAY WE'VE HAD ENOUGH OF IT AND WE WON'T GO ANY FURTHER
lbi-7601-175351-0009 YOU SHAN'T KILL US WITH HUNGER AND WORK IN THE WINTER AND THEY SHAN'T LIGHT THE FIRES
lbi-7601-175351-0010 IF YOU REPEAT WHAT THE MAN SAYS ANSWERED HATTERAS I'LL HAVE YOU SHUT UP IN YOUR CABIN AND GUARDED
lbi-7601-175351-0011 A MURMUR WAS HEARD
lbi-7601-175351-0012 THE ENGINEER FOLLOWED BY PLOVER AND WARREN WENT DOWN TO HIS POST
lbi-7601-175351-0013 THE STEAM WAS SOON GOT UP THE ANCHORS WERE WEIGHED AND THE FORWARD VEERED AWAY EAST CUTTING THE YOUNG ICE WITH HER STEEL PROW
lbi-7601-175351-0014 BETWEEN BARING ISLAND AND BEECHER POINT THERE ARE A CONSIDERABLE QUANTITY OF ISLANDS IN THE MIDST OF ICE FIELDS THE STREAMS CROWD TOGETHER IN THE LITTLE CHANNELS WHICH CUT UP THIS PART OF THE SEA THEY HAD A TENDENCY TO AGGLOMERATE UNDER THE RELATIVELY LOW TEMPERATURE HUMMOCKS WERE FORMED HERE AND THERE AND THESE MASSES ALREADY MORE COMPACT DENSER AND CLOSER TOGETHER WOULD SOON FORM AN IMPENETRABLE MASS
lbi-7601-175351-0015 I AM BEGINNING NOT TO ANSWERED WALL
lbi-7601-175351-0016 HATTERAS STILL HOPED TO FIND AN OPEN SEA BEYOND THE SEVENTY SEVENTH PARALLEL AS SIR EDWARD BELCHER HAD DONE
lbi-7601-175351-0017 OUGHT HE TO TREAT THESE ACCOUNTS AS APOCRYPHAL
lbi-7601-175351-0018 THE NEXT DAY THE SUN SET FOR THE FIRST TIME ENDING THUS THE LONG SERIES OF DAYS WITH TWENTY FOUR HOURS IN THEM
lbi-7601-175351-0019 THE MEN HAD ENDED BY GETTING ACCUSTOMED TO THE CONTINUAL DAYLIGHT BUT IT HAD NEVER MADE ANY DIFFERENCE TO THE ANIMALS THE GREENLAND DOGS WENT TO THEIR REST AT THEIR ACCUSTOMED HOUR AND DICK SLEPT AS REGULARLY EVERY EVENING AS THOUGH DARKNESS HAD COVERED THE SKY
lbi-7601-175351-0020 THE DOCTOR BY FOLLOWING JOHNSON'S ADVICE ACCUSTOMED HIMSELF TO SUPPORT THE LOW TEMPERATURE HE ALMOST ALWAYS STAYED ON DECK BRAVING THE COLD THE WIND AND THE SNOW
lbi-7601-175351-0021 THERE'S MORE THAN ONE AMONGST US WHO WOULD LIKE TO IMITATE THEM I THINK
lbi-7601-175351-0022 THEY ARE COWARDS MISTER CLAWBONNY THOSE ANIMALS HAVE NO PROVISIONS AS WE HAVE AND ARE OBLIGED TO SEEK THEIR FOOD WHERE IT IS TO BE FOUND
lbi-7601-175351-0023 YOU HOPE THAT HATTERAS WILL SUCCEED THEN
lbi-7601-175351-0024 HE CERTAINLY WILL MISTER CLAWBONNY
lbi-7601-175351-0025 I AM OF THE SAME OPINION AS YOU JOHNSON AND IF HE ONLY WANTED ONE FAITHFUL COMPANION HE'LL HAVE TWO
lbi-7601-175351-0026 PRINCE ALBERT LAND WHICH THE FORWARD WAS THEN COASTING BEARS ALSO THE NAME OF GRINNELL LAND AND THOUGH HATTERAS FROM HIS HATRED TO THE YANKEES WOULD NEVER CALL IT BY ITS AMERICAN NAME IT IS THE ONE IT GENERALLY GOES BY
lbi-7601-175351-0027 ON THE EIGHTEENTH OF AUGUST THEY SIGHTED BRITANNIA MOUNTAIN SCARCELY VISIBLE THROUGH THE MIST AND THE FORWARD WEIGHED ANCHOR THE NEXT DAY IN NORTHUMBERLAND BAY
