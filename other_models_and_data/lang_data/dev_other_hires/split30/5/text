lbi-1630-96099-0000 THAT TOO SIR YOU WILL OF COURSE UNDERTAKE
lbi-1630-96099-0001 THEN SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED HE HAS SOME SPECIAL INFORMATION SOME GREAT NEWS
lbi-1630-96099-0002 WHEN BLOCK APPEARED IT WAS EVIDENT THAT SOMETHING HAD GONE WRONG WITH HIM
lbi-1630-96099-0003 GONE NOW JUST WHEN WE MOST WANT HIM NEVER
lbi-1630-96099-0004 IDIOT TRIPLE IDIOT
lbi-1630-96099-0005 YOU SHALL BE DISMISSED DISCHARGED FROM THIS HOUR YOU ARE A DISGRACE TO THE FORCE
lbi-1630-96099-0006 IT IS THAT OR YOUR GREAT GLUTTONY
lbi-1630-96099-0007 MY GENTLEMAN MADE HIMSELF MOST PLEASANT
lbi-1630-96099-0008 WELL AT ANY RATE FOR MY SINS I ACCEPTED
lbi-1630-96099-0009 WE ENTERED THE FIRST RESTAURANT THAT OF THE REUNITED FRIENDS YOU KNOW IT PERHAPS MONSIEUR
lbi-1630-96099-0010 I HAD NO FEAR OF HIM NOT TILL THE VERY LAST WHEN HE PLAYED ME THIS EVIL TURN
lbi-1630-96099-0011 I SUSPECTED NOTHING WHEN HE BROUGHT OUT HIS POCKETBOOK IT WAS STUFFED FULL MONSIEUR I SAW THAT AND MY CONFIDENCE INCREASED CALLED FOR THE RECKONING AND PAID WITH AN ITALIAN BANK NOTE
lbi-1630-96099-0012 EXCUSE ME ONE MOMENT PRAY
lbi-1630-96099-0013 HE WENT OUT MONSIEUR AND PIFF PAFF HE WAS NO MORE TO BE SEEN
lbi-1630-96099-0014 WHY LET HIM OUT OF YOUR SIGHT
lbi-1630-96099-0015 IT WAS ONLY NOW AT THE ELEVENTH HOUR THAT THE ITALIAN HAD BECOME INCULPATED AND THE QUESTION OF HIS POSSIBLE ANXIETY TO ESCAPE HAD NEVER BEEN CONSIDERED
lbi-1630-96099-0016 HE LEFT EVERYTHING BEHIND
lbi-1630-96099-0017 HAND IT ME SAID THE CHIEF AND WHEN IT CAME INTO HIS HANDS HE BEGAN TO TURN OVER THE LEAVES HURRIEDLY
lbi-1630-96099-0018 I DO NOT UNDERSTAND NOT MORE THAN A WORD HERE AND THERE
lbi-1630-96099-0019 IT IS NO DOUBT ITALIAN
lbi-1630-96099-0020 OF COURSE SUCH A CONSUMMATE ASS AS YOU HAVE PROVED YOURSELF WOULD NOT THINK OF SEARCHING THE RESTAURANT OR THE IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD OR OF MAKING INQUIRIES AS TO WHETHER HE HAD BEEN SEEN OR AS TO WHICH WAY HE HAD GONE
lbi-1630-96099-0021 IT WAS A NOTE FOR A HUNDRED LIRE A HUNDRED FRANCS AND THE RESTAURANT BILL WAS NO MORE THAN SEVENTEEN FRANCS HAH
lbi-1630-96099-0022 HE WAS MUCH PRESSED IN A GREAT HURRY
lbi-1630-96099-0023 DIRECTLY HE CROSSED THE THRESHOLD HE CALLED THE FIRST CAB AND WAS DRIVING AWAY BUT HE WAS STOPPED THE DEVIL
lbi-1630-96099-0024 HE WISHED TO PASS ON TO LEAVE HER SHE WOULD NOT CONSENT THEN THEY BOTH GOT INTO THE CAB AND WERE DRIVEN AWAY TOGETHER
lbi-1650-157641-0000 THE SOCIAL ATTITUDE TOWARDS SMOKING IN EARLY VICTORIAN DAYS AND FOR SOME TIME LATER WAS CURIOUS
lbi-1650-157641-0001 NOW MISSUS QUILP HE SAYS I FEEL IN A SMOKING HUMOUR AND SHALL PROBABLY BLAZE AWAY ALL NIGHT
lbi-1650-157641-0002 BUT SIT WHERE YOU ARE IF YOU PLEASE IN CASE I WANT YOU
lbi-1650-157641-0003 THE DWARF'S TASTES HOWEVER WERE CATHOLIC
lbi-1650-157641-0004 BUT QUILP AND BRASS WERE NOT IN SOCIETY
lbi-1650-157641-0005 THERE WERE STILL PLENTY OF ACTIVE OPPONENTS AND DENOUNCERS OF TOBACCO
lbi-1650-157641-0006 ONE OF THE MOST DISTINGUISHED WAS THE GREAT DUKE OF WELLINGTON WHO ABOMINATED SMOKING AND WAS ANNOYED BY THE INCREASE OF CIGAR SMOKING AMONG OFFICERS OF THE ARMY
lbi-1650-157641-0007 THE LADIES HAD A KEEN SCENT FOR THE ABOMINABLE ODOUR OF TOBACCO AND DISTRUSTED THE MEN WHO SMOKED
lbi-1650-157641-0008 HERE IS FITZ BOODLE'S OR THACKERAY'S COMMENT ON IT WHAT IS THIS SMOKING THAT IT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A CRIME
lbi-1650-157641-0009 I BELIEVE IN MY HEART THAT WOMEN ARE JEALOUS OF IT AS OF A RIVAL
lbi-1650-157641-0010 I WOULD LAY A GUINEA THAT MANY A LADY WHO HAS JUST BEEN KIND ENOUGH TO READ THE ABOVE LINES LAYS DOWN THE BOOK AFTER THIS CONFESSION OF MINE THAT I AM A SMOKER AND SAYS OH THE VULGAR WRETCH AND PASSES ON TO SOMETHING ELSE
lbi-1650-157641-0011 GERMANY HAS BEEN PUFFING FOR THREE SCORE YEARS FRANCE SMOKES TO A MAN
lbi-1650-157641-0012 PSHA LOOK AT HIS PROGRESS
lbi-1650-157641-0013 THUS THE ODOUR OF TOBACCO WAS NOT BROUGHT INTO THE DRAWING ROOM
lbi-1650-157641-0014 THE JOURNALISTS AND BOHEMIANS WHO MET AT THE COGERS WERE ABOVE OR BELOW THE DICTATES OF FASHION AND SMOKING WAS ALWAYS A FEATURE OF THEIR GATHERINGS
lbi-1650-157641-0015 BOTH QUEEN VICTORIA AND THE PRINCE CONSORT DETESTED IT SO TOBACCO WAS TABOO WHEREVER THE COURT WAS
lbi-1650-167613-0000 THE OFFICERS WERE ABOUT TO TAKE LEAVE BUT PRINCE ANDREW APPARENTLY RELUCTANT TO BE LEFT ALONE WITH HIS FRIEND ASKED THEM TO STAY AND HAVE TEA
lbi-1650-167613-0001 SEATS WERE BROUGHT IN AND SO WAS THE TEA
lbi-1650-167613-0002 THE OFFICERS GAZED WITH SURPRISE AT PIERRE'S HUGE STOUT FIGURE AND LISTENED TO HIS TALK OF MOSCOW AND THE POSITION OF OUR ARMY ROUND WHICH HE HAD RIDDEN
lbi-1650-167613-0003 SO YOU UNDERSTAND THE WHOLE POSITION OF OUR TROOPS
lbi-1650-167613-0004 NOT BEING A MILITARY MAN I CAN'T SAY I HAVE UNDERSTOOD IT FULLY BUT I UNDERSTAND THE GENERAL POSITION
lbi-1650-167613-0005 WELL THEN YOU KNOW MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE BE IT WHO IT MAY SAID PRINCE ANDREW
lbi-1650-167613-0006 AND TELL ME YOUR OPINION OF BARCLAY DE TOLLY
lbi-1650-167613-0007 PIERRE LOOKED AT TIMOKHIN WITH THE CONDESCENDINGLY INTERROGATIVE SMILE WITH WHICH EVERYBODY INVOLUNTARILY ADDRESSED THAT OFFICER
lbi-1650-167613-0008 WE SEE LIGHT AGAIN SINCE HIS SERENITY HAS BEEN APPOINTED YOUR EXCELLENCY SAID TIMOKHIN TIMIDLY AND CONTINUALLY TURNING TO GLANCE AT HIS COLONEL
lbi-1650-167613-0009 WHY SO ASKED PIERRE
lbi-1650-167613-0010 THEN WHY WAS IT FORBIDDEN
lbi-1650-167613-0011 AT SMOLENSK TOO HE JUDGED CORRECTLY THAT THE FRENCH MIGHT OUTFLANK US AS THEY HAD LARGER FORCES
lbi-1650-167613-0012 HE ORDERED US TO RETREAT AND ALL OUR EFFORTS AND LOSSES WENT FOR NOTHING
lbi-1650-167613-0013 SO IT HAS BEEN WITH BARCLAY
lbi-1650-167613-0014 WHILE RUSSIA WAS WELL A FOREIGNER COULD SERVE HER AND BE A SPLENDID MINISTER BUT AS SOON AS SHE IS IN DANGER SHE NEEDS ONE OF HER OWN KIN
lbi-1650-167613-0015 AND THEY SAY HE'S A SKILLFUL COMMANDER REJOINED PIERRE
lbi-1650-167613-0016 I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT IS MEANT BY A SKILLFUL COMMANDER REPLIED PRINCE ANDREW IRONICALLY
lbi-1650-167613-0017 A SKILLFUL COMMANDER REPLIED PIERRE
lbi-1650-167613-0018 PIERRE LOOKED AT HIM IN SURPRISE
lbi-1650-167613-0019 AND YET THEY SAY THAT WAR IS LIKE A GAME OF CHESS HE REMARKED
lbi-1650-167613-0020 THE RELATIVE STRENGTH OF BODIES OF TROOPS CAN NEVER BE KNOWN TO ANYONE
lbi-1650-167613-0021 SUCCESS NEVER DEPENDS AND NEVER WILL DEPEND ON POSITION OR EQUIPMENT OR EVEN ON NUMBERS AND LEAST OF ALL ON POSITION BUT ON WHAT THEN
lbi-1650-167613-0022 ON THE FEELING THAT IS IN ME AND IN HIM HE POINTED TO TIMOKHIN AND IN EACH SOLDIER
lbi-1650-167613-0023 A BATTLE IS WON BY THOSE WHO FIRMLY RESOLVE TO WIN IT
lbi-1650-167613-0024 WHY DID WE LOSE THE BATTLE AT AUSTERLITZ
lbi-1650-167613-0025 WE'VE LOST SO LET US RUN AND WE RAN
lbi-1650-167613-0026 BUT TOMORROW WE SHAN'T SAY IT
lbi-1650-167613-0027 BUT WHAT AWAITS US TOMORROW
lbi-1650-167613-0028 THE FACT IS THAT THOSE MEN WITH WHOM YOU HAVE RIDDEN ROUND THE POSITION NOT ONLY DO NOT HELP MATTERS BUT HINDER
lbi-1650-167613-0029 THAT'S THE TRUTH THE REAL TRUTH SAID TIMOKHIN
lbi-1650-167613-0030 IT'S NOT THE DAY FOR THAT THEY SAY
lbi-1650-167613-0031 ALL WERE SILENT THE OFFICERS ROSE
lbi-1650-167613-0032 YES YES ANSWERED PRINCE ANDREW ABSENTLY
lbi-1650-167613-0033 THE FRENCH HAVE DESTROYED MY HOME AND ARE ON THEIR WAY TO DESTROY MOSCOW THEY HAVE OUTRAGED AND ARE OUTRAGING ME EVERY MOMENT THEY ARE MY ENEMIES
lbi-1650-167613-0034 IN MY OPINION THEY ARE ALL CRIMINALS
lbi-1650-167613-0035 AND SO THINKS TIMOKHIN AND THE WHOLE ARMY
lbi-1650-167613-0036 SINCE THEY ARE MY FOES THEY CANNOT BE MY FRIENDS WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN SAID AT TILSIT
lbi-1650-167613-0037 YES YES MUTTERED PIERRE LOOKING WITH SHINING EYES AT PRINCE ANDREW
lbi-1650-167613-0038 THEY TALK TO US OF THE RULES OF WAR OF CHIVALRY OF FLAGS OF TRUCE OF MERCY TO THE UNFORTUNATE AND SO ON IT'S ALL RUBBISH
lbi-1650-167613-0039 THEY PLUNDER OTHER PEOPLE'S HOUSES ISSUE FALSE PAPER MONEY AND WORST OF ALL THEY KILL MY CHILDREN AND MY FATHER AND THEN TALK OF RULES OF WAR AND MAGNANIMITY TO FOES
lbi-1650-167613-0040 TAKE NO PRISONERS BUT KILL AND BE KILLED
lbi-1650-167613-0041 PRINCE ANDREW WHO HAD THOUGHT IT WAS ALL THE SAME TO HIM WHETHER OR NOT MOSCOW WAS TAKEN AS SMOLENSK HAD BEEN WAS SUDDENLY CHECKED IN HIS SPEECH BY AN UNEXPECTED CRAMP IN HIS THROAT
lbi-1650-167613-0042 HE PACED UP AND DOWN A FEW TIMES IN SILENCE BUT HIS EYES GLITTERED FEVERISHLY AND HIS LIPS QUIVERED AS HE BEGAN SPEAKING
lbi-1650-167613-0043 AND WHEN THERE WAS A WAR LIKE THIS ONE IT WOULD BE WAR
lbi-1650-167613-0044 WHAT IS NEEDED FOR SUCCESS IN WARFARE
lbi-1650-167613-0045 AND IN SPITE OF ALL THIS IT IS THE HIGHEST CLASS RESPECTED BY EVERYONE
lbi-1650-167613-0046 HOW DOES GOD ABOVE LOOK AT THEM AND HEAR THEM
lbi-1650-167613-0047 I SEE THAT I HAVE BEGUN TO UNDERSTAND TOO MUCH
lbi-1650-167613-0048 AND IT DOESN'T DO FOR MAN TO TASTE OF THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL AH WELL IT'S NOT FOR LONG HE ADDED
lbi-1650-167613-0049 HOWEVER YOU'RE SLEEPY AND IT'S TIME FOR ME TO SLEEP
lbi-1650-167613-0050 GO BACK TO GORKI SAID PRINCE ANDREW SUDDENLY
lbi-1650-167613-0051 GO GO BEFORE A BATTLE ONE MUST HAVE ONE'S SLEEP OUT REPEATED PRINCE ANDREW
lbi-1650-167613-0052 NO HE DOES NOT WANT IT PIERRE CONCLUDED
lbi-1650-167613-0053 AND I KNOW THAT THIS IS OUR LAST MEETING
lbi-1650-167613-0054 ONE PICTURE SUCCEEDED ANOTHER IN HIS IMAGINATION
lbi-1650-167613-0055 ON ONE OF THEM HE DWELT LONG AND JOYFULLY
