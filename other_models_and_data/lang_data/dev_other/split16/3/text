lbi-1630-73710-0000 IT IS AT THE FOOT OF WOMAN THAT WE LAY THE LAURELS THAT WITHOUT HER SMILE WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN GAINED IT IS HER IMAGE THAT STRINGS THE LYRE OF THE POET THAT ANIMATES OUR VOICE IN THE BLAZE OF ELOQUENT FACTION AND GUIDES OUR BRAIN IN THE AUGUST TOILS OF STATELY COUNCILS
lbi-1630-73710-0001 IS THERE NO HOPE FOR THEM SO FULL OF HOPE
lbi-1630-73710-0002 IT MAKES THE HEART ACHE BUT TO PICTURE SUCH VICISSITUDES TO THE IMAGINATION
lbi-1630-73710-0003 THE KNOWLEDGE THAT SUCH CHANGES CAN OCCUR FLITS OVER THE MIND LIKE THE THOUGHT OF DEATH OBSCURING ALL OUR GAY FANCIES WITH ITS BAT LIKE WING AND TAINTING THE HEALTHY ATMOSPHERE OF OUR HAPPINESS WITH ITS VENOMOUS EXPIRATIONS
lbi-1630-73710-0004 MINE OWN
lbi-1630-73710-0005 WHAT DID WHAT COULD YOU DO
lbi-1630-73710-0006 I BEAT ABOUT MY CHAMBER LIKE A SILLY BIRD IN A CAGE
lbi-1630-73710-0007 DO NOT THINK OF MOVING TO DAY
lbi-1630-73710-0008 DO NOT KEEP THE MESSENGER AN INSTANT
lbi-1630-73710-0009 HE IS ON MY PONY
lbi-1630-73710-0010 WRITE ONLY ONE WORD TO YOUR OWN HENRIETTA
lbi-1630-73710-0011 FERDINAND TO HENRIETTA
lbi-1630-73710-0012 GOD BLESS YOU MY HENRIETTA MY BELOVED MY MATCHLESS HENRIETTA
lbi-1630-73710-0013 WHAT HAS THAT SEPARATION NOT COST ME
lbi-1630-73710-0014 PANGS THAT I COULD NOT CONCEIVE ANY HUMAN MISERY COULD OCCASION
lbi-1630-73710-0015 AND YET I OUGHT TO BE GRATEFUL THAT HE WAS UNINJURED LAST NIGHT
lbi-1630-73710-0016 I DARE NOT NOW OWN HOW FOOLISH I WAS
lbi-1630-73710-0017 DO NOT BE ANGRY WITH YOUR HENRIETTA BUT I AM NERVOUS ABOUT CONCEALING OUR ENGAGEMENT FROM PAPA
lbi-1630-73710-0018 DAYS MUST ELAPSE BEFORE YOU CAN REACH BATH AND I KNOW FERDINAND I KNOW YOUR OFFICE IS MORE DIFFICULT THAN YOU WILL CONFESS
lbi-1630-73710-0019 BUT COME BACK MY OWN AS SOON AS YOU CAN AND WRITE TO ME AT THE POST OFFICE AS YOU SETTLED
lbi-1630-73710-0020 THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT YOU ARE SO NEAR MAKES ME RESTLESS
lbi-1630-73710-0021 I WISH TO MEET HIM WITH AS MUCH CALMNESS AS I CAN COMMAND
lbi-1630-96099-0000 THAT TOO SIR YOU WILL OF COURSE UNDERTAKE
lbi-1630-96099-0001 THEN SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED HE HAS SOME SPECIAL INFORMATION SOME GREAT NEWS
lbi-1630-96099-0002 WHEN BLOCK APPEARED IT WAS EVIDENT THAT SOMETHING HAD GONE WRONG WITH HIM
lbi-1630-96099-0003 GONE NOW JUST WHEN WE MOST WANT HIM NEVER
lbi-1630-96099-0004 IDIOT TRIPLE IDIOT
lbi-1630-96099-0005 YOU SHALL BE DISMISSED DISCHARGED FROM THIS HOUR YOU ARE A DISGRACE TO THE FORCE
lbi-1630-96099-0006 IT IS THAT OR YOUR GREAT GLUTTONY
lbi-1630-96099-0007 MY GENTLEMAN MADE HIMSELF MOST PLEASANT
lbi-1630-96099-0008 WELL AT ANY RATE FOR MY SINS I ACCEPTED
lbi-1630-96099-0009 WE ENTERED THE FIRST RESTAURANT THAT OF THE REUNITED FRIENDS YOU KNOW IT PERHAPS MONSIEUR
lbi-1630-96099-0010 I HAD NO FEAR OF HIM NOT TILL THE VERY LAST WHEN HE PLAYED ME THIS EVIL TURN
lbi-1630-96099-0011 I SUSPECTED NOTHING WHEN HE BROUGHT OUT HIS POCKETBOOK IT WAS STUFFED FULL MONSIEUR I SAW THAT AND MY CONFIDENCE INCREASED CALLED FOR THE RECKONING AND PAID WITH AN ITALIAN BANK NOTE
lbi-1630-96099-0012 EXCUSE ME ONE MOMENT PRAY
lbi-1630-96099-0013 HE WENT OUT MONSIEUR AND PIFF PAFF HE WAS NO MORE TO BE SEEN
lbi-1630-96099-0014 WHY LET HIM OUT OF YOUR SIGHT
lbi-1630-96099-0015 IT WAS ONLY NOW AT THE ELEVENTH HOUR THAT THE ITALIAN HAD BECOME INCULPATED AND THE QUESTION OF HIS POSSIBLE ANXIETY TO ESCAPE HAD NEVER BEEN CONSIDERED
lbi-1630-96099-0016 HE LEFT EVERYTHING BEHIND
lbi-1630-96099-0017 HAND IT ME SAID THE CHIEF AND WHEN IT CAME INTO HIS HANDS HE BEGAN TO TURN OVER THE LEAVES HURRIEDLY
lbi-1630-96099-0018 I DO NOT UNDERSTAND NOT MORE THAN A WORD HERE AND THERE
lbi-1630-96099-0019 IT IS NO DOUBT ITALIAN
lbi-1630-96099-0020 OF COURSE SUCH A CONSUMMATE ASS AS YOU HAVE PROVED YOURSELF WOULD NOT THINK OF SEARCHING THE RESTAURANT OR THE IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD OR OF MAKING INQUIRIES AS TO WHETHER HE HAD BEEN SEEN OR AS TO WHICH WAY HE HAD GONE
lbi-1630-96099-0021 IT WAS A NOTE FOR A HUNDRED LIRE A HUNDRED FRANCS AND THE RESTAURANT BILL WAS NO MORE THAN SEVENTEEN FRANCS HAH
lbi-1630-96099-0022 HE WAS MUCH PRESSED IN A GREAT HURRY
lbi-1630-96099-0023 DIRECTLY HE CROSSED THE THRESHOLD HE CALLED THE FIRST CAB AND WAS DRIVING AWAY BUT HE WAS STOPPED THE DEVIL
lbi-1630-96099-0024 HE WISHED TO PASS ON TO LEAVE HER SHE WOULD NOT CONSENT THEN THEY BOTH GOT INTO THE CAB AND WERE DRIVEN AWAY TOGETHER
lbi-1650-157641-0000 THE SOCIAL ATTITUDE TOWARDS SMOKING IN EARLY VICTORIAN DAYS AND FOR SOME TIME LATER WAS CURIOUS
lbi-1650-157641-0001 NOW MISSUS QUILP HE SAYS I FEEL IN A SMOKING HUMOUR AND SHALL PROBABLY BLAZE AWAY ALL NIGHT
lbi-1650-157641-0002 BUT SIT WHERE YOU ARE IF YOU PLEASE IN CASE I WANT YOU
lbi-1650-157641-0003 THE DWARF'S TASTES HOWEVER WERE CATHOLIC
lbi-1650-157641-0004 BUT QUILP AND BRASS WERE NOT IN SOCIETY
lbi-1650-157641-0005 THERE WERE STILL PLENTY OF ACTIVE OPPONENTS AND DENOUNCERS OF TOBACCO
lbi-1650-157641-0006 ONE OF THE MOST DISTINGUISHED WAS THE GREAT DUKE OF WELLINGTON WHO ABOMINATED SMOKING AND WAS ANNOYED BY THE INCREASE OF CIGAR SMOKING AMONG OFFICERS OF THE ARMY
lbi-1650-157641-0007 THE LADIES HAD A KEEN SCENT FOR THE ABOMINABLE ODOUR OF TOBACCO AND DISTRUSTED THE MEN WHO SMOKED
lbi-1650-157641-0008 HERE IS FITZ BOODLE'S OR THACKERAY'S COMMENT ON IT WHAT IS THIS SMOKING THAT IT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A CRIME
lbi-1650-157641-0009 I BELIEVE IN MY HEART THAT WOMEN ARE JEALOUS OF IT AS OF A RIVAL
lbi-1650-157641-0010 I WOULD LAY A GUINEA THAT MANY A LADY WHO HAS JUST BEEN KIND ENOUGH TO READ THE ABOVE LINES LAYS DOWN THE BOOK AFTER THIS CONFESSION OF MINE THAT I AM A SMOKER AND SAYS OH THE VULGAR WRETCH AND PASSES ON TO SOMETHING ELSE
lbi-1650-157641-0011 GERMANY HAS BEEN PUFFING FOR THREE SCORE YEARS FRANCE SMOKES TO A MAN
lbi-1650-157641-0012 PSHA LOOK AT HIS PROGRESS
lbi-1650-157641-0013 THUS THE ODOUR OF TOBACCO WAS NOT BROUGHT INTO THE DRAWING ROOM
lbi-1650-157641-0014 THE JOURNALISTS AND BOHEMIANS WHO MET AT THE COGERS WERE ABOVE OR BELOW THE DICTATES OF FASHION AND SMOKING WAS ALWAYS A FEATURE OF THEIR GATHERINGS
lbi-1650-157641-0015 BOTH QUEEN VICTORIA AND THE PRINCE CONSORT DETESTED IT SO TOBACCO WAS TABOO WHEREVER THE COURT WAS
lbi-1650-167613-0000 THE OFFICERS WERE ABOUT TO TAKE LEAVE BUT PRINCE ANDREW APPARENTLY RELUCTANT TO BE LEFT ALONE WITH HIS FRIEND ASKED THEM TO STAY AND HAVE TEA
lbi-1650-167613-0001 SEATS WERE BROUGHT IN AND SO WAS THE TEA
lbi-1650-167613-0002 THE OFFICERS GAZED WITH SURPRISE AT PIERRE'S HUGE STOUT FIGURE AND LISTENED TO HIS TALK OF MOSCOW AND THE POSITION OF OUR ARMY ROUND WHICH HE HAD RIDDEN
lbi-1650-167613-0003 SO YOU UNDERSTAND THE WHOLE POSITION OF OUR TROOPS
lbi-1650-167613-0004 NOT BEING A MILITARY MAN I CAN'T SAY I HAVE UNDERSTOOD IT FULLY BUT I UNDERSTAND THE GENERAL POSITION
lbi-1650-167613-0005 WELL THEN YOU KNOW MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE BE IT WHO IT MAY SAID PRINCE ANDREW
lbi-1650-167613-0006 AND TELL ME YOUR OPINION OF BARCLAY DE TOLLY
lbi-1650-167613-0007 PIERRE LOOKED AT TIMOKHIN WITH THE CONDESCENDINGLY INTERROGATIVE SMILE WITH WHICH EVERYBODY INVOLUNTARILY ADDRESSED THAT OFFICER
lbi-1650-167613-0008 WE SEE LIGHT AGAIN SINCE HIS SERENITY HAS BEEN APPOINTED YOUR EXCELLENCY SAID TIMOKHIN TIMIDLY AND CONTINUALLY TURNING TO GLANCE AT HIS COLONEL
lbi-1650-167613-0009 WHY SO ASKED PIERRE
lbi-1650-167613-0010 THEN WHY WAS IT FORBIDDEN
lbi-1650-167613-0011 AT SMOLENSK TOO HE JUDGED CORRECTLY THAT THE FRENCH MIGHT OUTFLANK US AS THEY HAD LARGER FORCES
lbi-1650-167613-0012 HE ORDERED US TO RETREAT AND ALL OUR EFFORTS AND LOSSES WENT FOR NOTHING
lbi-1650-167613-0013 SO IT HAS BEEN WITH BARCLAY
lbi-1650-167613-0014 WHILE RUSSIA WAS WELL A FOREIGNER COULD SERVE HER AND BE A SPLENDID MINISTER BUT AS SOON AS SHE IS IN DANGER SHE NEEDS ONE OF HER OWN KIN
lbi-1650-167613-0015 AND THEY SAY HE'S A SKILLFUL COMMANDER REJOINED PIERRE
lbi-1650-167613-0016 I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT IS MEANT BY A SKILLFUL COMMANDER REPLIED PRINCE ANDREW IRONICALLY
lbi-1650-167613-0017 A SKILLFUL COMMANDER REPLIED PIERRE
lbi-1650-167613-0018 PIERRE LOOKED AT HIM IN SURPRISE
lbi-1650-167613-0019 AND YET THEY SAY THAT WAR IS LIKE A GAME OF CHESS HE REMARKED
lbi-1650-167613-0020 THE RELATIVE STRENGTH OF BODIES OF TROOPS CAN NEVER BE KNOWN TO ANYONE
lbi-1650-167613-0021 SUCCESS NEVER DEPENDS AND NEVER WILL DEPEND ON POSITION OR EQUIPMENT OR EVEN ON NUMBERS AND LEAST OF ALL ON POSITION BUT ON WHAT THEN
lbi-1650-167613-0022 ON THE FEELING THAT IS IN ME AND IN HIM HE POINTED TO TIMOKHIN AND IN EACH SOLDIER
lbi-1650-167613-0023 A BATTLE IS WON BY THOSE WHO FIRMLY RESOLVE TO WIN IT
lbi-1650-167613-0024 WHY DID WE LOSE THE BATTLE AT AUSTERLITZ
lbi-1650-167613-0025 WE'VE LOST SO LET US RUN AND WE RAN
lbi-1650-167613-0026 BUT TOMORROW WE SHAN'T SAY IT
lbi-1650-167613-0027 BUT WHAT AWAITS US TOMORROW
lbi-1650-167613-0028 THE FACT IS THAT THOSE MEN WITH WHOM YOU HAVE RIDDEN ROUND THE POSITION NOT ONLY DO NOT HELP MATTERS BUT HINDER
lbi-1650-167613-0029 THAT'S THE TRUTH THE REAL TRUTH SAID TIMOKHIN
lbi-1650-167613-0030 IT'S NOT THE DAY FOR THAT THEY SAY
lbi-1650-167613-0031 ALL WERE SILENT THE OFFICERS ROSE
lbi-1650-167613-0032 YES YES ANSWERED PRINCE ANDREW ABSENTLY
lbi-1650-167613-0033 THE FRENCH HAVE DESTROYED MY HOME AND ARE ON THEIR WAY TO DESTROY MOSCOW THEY HAVE OUTRAGED AND ARE OUTRAGING ME EVERY MOMENT THEY ARE MY ENEMIES
lbi-1650-167613-0034 IN MY OPINION THEY ARE ALL CRIMINALS
lbi-1650-167613-0035 AND SO THINKS TIMOKHIN AND THE WHOLE ARMY
lbi-1650-167613-0036 SINCE THEY ARE MY FOES THEY CANNOT BE MY FRIENDS WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN SAID AT TILSIT
lbi-1650-167613-0037 YES YES MUTTERED PIERRE LOOKING WITH SHINING EYES AT PRINCE ANDREW
lbi-1650-167613-0038 THEY TALK TO US OF THE RULES OF WAR OF CHIVALRY OF FLAGS OF TRUCE OF MERCY TO THE UNFORTUNATE AND SO ON IT'S ALL RUBBISH
lbi-1650-167613-0039 THEY PLUNDER OTHER PEOPLE'S HOUSES ISSUE FALSE PAPER MONEY AND WORST OF ALL THEY KILL MY CHILDREN AND MY FATHER AND THEN TALK OF RULES OF WAR AND MAGNANIMITY TO FOES
lbi-1650-167613-0040 TAKE NO PRISONERS BUT KILL AND BE KILLED
lbi-1650-167613-0041 PRINCE ANDREW WHO HAD THOUGHT IT WAS ALL THE SAME TO HIM WHETHER OR NOT MOSCOW WAS TAKEN AS SMOLENSK HAD BEEN WAS SUDDENLY CHECKED IN HIS SPEECH BY AN UNEXPECTED CRAMP IN HIS THROAT
lbi-1650-167613-0042 HE PACED UP AND DOWN A FEW TIMES IN SILENCE BUT HIS EYES GLITTERED FEVERISHLY AND HIS LIPS QUIVERED AS HE BEGAN SPEAKING
lbi-1650-167613-0043 AND WHEN THERE WAS A WAR LIKE THIS ONE IT WOULD BE WAR
lbi-1650-167613-0044 WHAT IS NEEDED FOR SUCCESS IN WARFARE
lbi-1650-167613-0045 AND IN SPITE OF ALL THIS IT IS THE HIGHEST CLASS RESPECTED BY EVERYONE
lbi-1650-167613-0046 HOW DOES GOD ABOVE LOOK AT THEM AND HEAR THEM
lbi-1650-167613-0047 I SEE THAT I HAVE BEGUN TO UNDERSTAND TOO MUCH
lbi-1650-167613-0048 AND IT DOESN'T DO FOR MAN TO TASTE OF THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL AH WELL IT'S NOT FOR LONG HE ADDED
lbi-1650-167613-0049 HOWEVER YOU'RE SLEEPY AND IT'S TIME FOR ME TO SLEEP
lbi-1650-167613-0050 GO BACK TO GORKI SAID PRINCE ANDREW SUDDENLY
lbi-1650-167613-0051 GO GO BEFORE A BATTLE ONE MUST HAVE ONE'S SLEEP OUT REPEATED PRINCE ANDREW
lbi-1650-167613-0052 NO HE DOES NOT WANT IT PIERRE CONCLUDED
lbi-1650-167613-0053 AND I KNOW THAT THIS IS OUR LAST MEETING
lbi-1650-167613-0054 ONE PICTURE SUCCEEDED ANOTHER IN HIS IMAGINATION
lbi-1650-167613-0055 ON ONE OF THEM HE DWELT LONG AND JOYFULLY
lbi-1650-173551-0000 HIS MAJOR DOMO CAME IN A SECOND TIME TO SAY THAT THE FRENCHMAN WHO HAD BROUGHT THE LETTER FROM THE COUNTESS WAS VERY ANXIOUS TO SEE HIM IF ONLY FOR A MINUTE AND THAT SOMEONE FROM BAZDEEV'S WIDOW HAD CALLED TO ASK PIERRE TO TAKE CHARGE OF HER HUSBAND'S BOOKS AS SHE HERSELF WAS LEAVING FOR THE COUNTRY
lbi-1650-173551-0001 THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE PASSAGE
lbi-1650-173551-0002 THE HALL PORTER WAS STANDING AT THE FRONT DOOR
lbi-1650-173551-0003 FROM THE LANDING WHERE PIERRE STOOD THERE WAS A SECOND STAIRCASE LEADING TO THE BACK ENTRANCE
lbi-1650-173551-0004 HE WENT DOWN THAT STAIRCASE AND OUT INTO THE YARD NO ONE HAD SEEN HIM
lbi-1650-173551-0005 WHEN HE FELT HE WAS BEING LOOKED AT HE BEHAVED LIKE AN OSTRICH WHICH HIDES ITS HEAD IN A BUSH IN ORDER NOT TO BE SEEN HE HUNG HIS HEAD AND QUICKENING HIS PACE WENT DOWN THE STREET
lbi-1650-173551-0006 HE HIRED THE FIRST CAB HE MET AND TOLD THE DRIVER TO GO TO THE PATRIARCH'S PONDS WHERE THE WIDOW BAZDEEV'S HOUSE WAS
lbi-1650-173551-0007 THIS WAS THE AUTHENTIC SCOTCH ACTS WITH BAZDEEV'S NOTES AND EXPLANATIONS
lbi-1650-173551-0008 HE SAT DOWN AT THE DUSTY WRITING TABLE AND HAVING LAID THE MANUSCRIPTS BEFORE HIM OPENED THEM OUT CLOSED THEM FINALLY PUSHED THEM AWAY AND RESTING HIS HEAD ON HIS HAND SANK INTO MEDITATION
lbi-1650-173551-0009 MAKAR ALEXEEVICH CAME TWICE THAT EVENING SHUFFLING ALONG IN HIS GALOSHES AS FAR AS THE DOOR AND STOPPED AND LOOKED INGRATIATINGLY AT PIERRE
lbi-1650-173552-0000 AT THAT VERY TIME AT TEN IN THE MORNING OF THE SECOND OF SEPTEMBER NAPOLEON WAS STANDING AMONG HIS TROOPS ON THE POKLONNY HILL LOOKING AT THE PANORAMA SPREAD OUT BEFORE HIM
lbi-1650-173552-0001 THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE MORNING WAS MAGICAL
lbi-1650-173552-0002 BUT MY CLEMENCY IS ALWAYS READY TO DESCEND UPON THE VANQUISHED
lbi-1650-173552-0003 YET HERE SHE IS LYING AT MY FEET WITH HER GOLDEN DOMES AND CROSSES SCINTILLATING AND TWINKLING IN THE SUNSHINE
lbi-1650-173552-0004 BUT I SHALL SPARE HER
lbi-1650-173552-0005 FROM THE HEIGHT OF THE KREMLIN YES THERE IS THE KREMLIN YES I WILL GIVE THEM JUST LAWS I WILL TEACH THEM THE MEANING OF TRUE CIVILIZATION I WILL MAKE GENERATIONS OF BOYARS REMEMBER THEIR CONQUEROR WITH LOVE
lbi-1650-173552-0006 I WILL TELL THE DEPUTATION THAT I DID NOT AND DO NOT DESIRE WAR THAT I HAVE WAGED WAR ONLY AGAINST THE FALSE POLICY OF THEIR COURT THAT I LOVE AND RESPECT ALEXANDER AND THAT IN MOSCOW I WILL ACCEPT TERMS OF PEACE WORTHY OF MYSELF AND OF MY PEOPLE
lbi-1650-173552-0007 I DO NOT WISH TO UTILIZE THE FORTUNES OF WAR TO HUMILIATE AN HONORED MONARCH
lbi-1650-173552-0008 HE WILL HAVE TO BE TOLD ALL THE SAME SAID SOME GENTLEMEN OF THE SUITE BUT GENTLEMEN
lbi-1650-173552-0009 A SINGLE REPORT OF A SIGNALING GUN FOLLOWED AND THE TROOPS WHO WERE ALREADY SPREAD OUT ON DIFFERENT SIDES OF MOSCOW MOVED INTO THE CITY THROUGH TVER KALUGA AND DOROGOMILOV GATES
lbi-1651-136854-0000 IN SEVENTEEN FIFTY HE CAME FORTH IN THE CHARACTER FOR WHICH HE WAS EMINENTLY QUALIFIED A MAJESTICK TEACHER OF MORAL AND RELIGIOUS WISDOM
lbi-1651-136854-0001 THE VEHICLE WHICH HE CHOSE WAS THAT OF A PERIODICAL PAPER WHICH HE KNEW HAD BEEN UPON FORMER OCCASIONS EMPLOYED WITH GREAT SUCCESS
lbi-1651-136854-0002 WHEN I WAS TO BEGIN PUBLISHING THAT PAPER I WAS AT A LOSS HOW TO NAME IT
lbi-1651-136854-0003 I SAT DOWN AT NIGHT UPON MY BEDSIDE AND RESOLVED THAT I WOULD NOT GO TO SLEEP TILL I HAD FIXED ITS TITLE
lbi-1651-136854-0004 ADDISON'S NOTE WAS A FICTION IN WHICH UNCONNECTED FRAGMENTS OF HIS LUCUBRATIONS WERE PURPOSELY JUMBLED TOGETHER IN AS ODD A MANNER AS HE COULD IN ORDER TO PRODUCE A LAUGHABLE EFFECT
lbi-1651-136854-0005 WHEREAS JOHNSON'S ABBREVIATIONS ARE ALL DISTINCT AND APPLICABLE TO EACH SUBJECT OF WHICH THE HEAD IS MENTIONED
lbi-1651-136854-0006 FOR INSTANCE THERE IS THE FOLLOWING SPECIMEN
lbi-1651-136854-0007 PUBLICK CALAMITIES NO SENSE OF THE PREVALENCE OF BAD HABITS NEGLIGENT OF TIME READY TO UNDERTAKE CARELESS TO PURSUE ALL CHANGED BY TIME
lbi-1651-136854-0008 CONFIDENT OF OTHERS UNSUSPECTING AS UNEXPERIENCED IMAGINING HIMSELF SECURE AGAINST NEGLECT NEVER IMAGINES THEY WILL VENTURE TO TREAT HIM ILL READY TO TRUST EXPECTING TO BE TRUSTED
lbi-1651-136854-0009 YOUTH AMBITIOUS AS THINKING HONOURS EASY TO BE HAD
lbi-1651-136854-0010 DIFFERENT KINDS OF PRAISE PURSUED AT DIFFERENT PERIODS
lbi-1651-136854-0011 OF THE FANCY IN MANHOOD
lbi-1651-136854-0012 BRUY
lbi-1651-136854-0013 SCHOLAR'S FRIENDSHIP LIKE LADIES
lbi-1651-136854-0014 DRAWN TO MAN BY WORDS REPELLED BY PASSIONS
lbi-1651-136854-0015 COMMON DANGER UNITES BY CRUSHING OTHER PASSIONS BUT THEY RETURN
lbi-1651-136854-0016 EQUALITY HINDERS COMPLIANCE
lbi-1651-136854-0017 SUPERIORITY PRODUCES INSOLENCE AND ENVY
lbi-1651-136854-0018 TOO MUCH REGARD IN EACH TO PRIVATE INTEREST TOO LITTLE
lbi-1651-136854-0019 OF CONFEDERACY WITH SUPERIOURS EVERY ONE KNOWS THE INCONVENIENCE
lbi-1651-136854-0020 WITH EQUALS NO AUTHORITY EVERY MAN HIS OWN OPINION HIS OWN INTEREST
lbi-1651-136854-0021 MAN AND WIFE HARDLY UNITED SCARCE EVER WITHOUT CHILDREN
lbi-1651-136854-0022 COMPUTATION IF TWO TO ONE AGAINST TWO HOW MANY AGAINST FIVE
lbi-1651-136854-0023 IN THIS AS IN MANY OTHER CASES I GO WRONG IN OPPOSITION TO CONVICTION FOR I THINK SCARCE ANY TEMPORAL GOOD EQUALLY TO BE DESIRED WITH THE REGARD AND FAMILIARITY OF WORTHY MEN
lbi-1651-136854-0024 I HOPE WE SHALL BE SOME TIME NEARER TO EACH OTHER AND HAVE A MORE READY WAY OF POURING OUT OUR HEARTS
lbi-1651-136854-0025 THE GREATEST BENEFIT WHICH ONE FRIEND CAN CONFER UPON ANOTHER IS TO GUARD AND EXCITE AND ELEVATE HIS VIRTUES
lbi-1651-136854-0026 THIS YOUR MOTHER WILL STILL PERFORM IF YOU DILIGENTLY PRESERVE THE MEMORY OF HER LIFE AND OF HER DEATH A LIFE SO FAR AS I CAN LEARN USEFUL WISE AND INNOCENT AND A DEATH RESIGNED PEACEFUL AND HOLY
lbi-1651-136854-0027 I CANNOT FORBEAR TO MENTION THAT NEITHER REASON NOR REVELATION DENIES YOU TO HOPE THAT YOU MAY INCREASE HER HAPPINESS BY OBEYING HER PRECEPTS AND THAT SHE MAY IN HER PRESENT STATE LOOK WITH PLEASURE UPON EVERY ACT OF VIRTUE TO WHICH HER INSTRUCTIONS OR EXAMPLE HAVE CONTRIBUTED
lbi-1651-136854-0028 IF YOU WRITE DOWN MINUTELY WHAT YOU REMEMBER OF HER FROM YOUR EARLIEST YEARS YOU WILL READ IT WITH GREAT PLEASURE AND RECEIVE FROM IT MANY HINTS OF SOOTHING RECOLLECTION WHEN TIME SHALL REMOVE HER YET FARTHER FROM YOU AND YOUR GRIEF SHALL BE MATURED TO VENERATION
lbi-1651-136854-0029 NO THIRTY TWO ON PATIENCE EVEN UNDER EXTREME MISERY IS WONDERFULLY LOFTY AND AS MUCH ABOVE THE RANT OF STOICISM AS THE SUN OF REVELATION IS BRIGHTER THAN THE TWILIGHT OF PAGAN PHILOSOPHY
lbi-1651-136854-0030 IT MUST INDEED BE ALLOWED THAT THE STRUCTURE OF HIS SENTENCES IS EXPANDED AND OFTEN HAS SOMEWHAT OF THE INVERSION OF LATIN AND THAT HE DELIGHTED TO EXPRESS FAMILIAR THOUGHTS IN PHILOSOPHICAL LANGUAGE BEING IN THIS THE REVERSE OF SOCRATES WHO IT WAS SAID REDUCED PHILOSOPHY TO THE SIMPLICITY OF COMMON LIFE
lbi-1651-136854-0031 THIS IDLE CHARGE HAS BEEN ECHOED FROM ONE BABBLER TO ANOTHER WHO HAVE CONFOUNDED JOHNSON'S ESSAYS WITH JOHNSON'S DICTIONARY AND BECAUSE HE THOUGHT IT RIGHT IN A LEXICON OF OUR LANGUAGE TO COLLECT MANY WORDS WHICH HAD FALLEN INTO DISUSE BUT WERE SUPPORTED BY GREAT AUTHORITIES IT HAS BEEN IMAGINED THAT ALL OF THESE HAVE BEEN INTERWOVEN INTO HIS OWN COMPOSITIONS
lbi-1651-136854-0032 THEIR STYLES DIFFER AS PLAIN CLOTH AND BROCADE
