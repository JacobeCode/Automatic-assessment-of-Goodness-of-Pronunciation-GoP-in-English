090340032	NO CREATURE EVER WANTED SO MUCH TO LIVE
090340039	BUT THERE WAS TROUBLE ENOUGH AT THE OTHER END
090340041	THIS IS THE STUFF TO PUT LIFE IN YOU
090340043	WHAT ABOUT THAT LETTER YOU WERE SPEAKING OF AT BREAKFAST
090340054	AND THEIR HANDS MIGHT JOIN
090340071	USE ME LIKE A STAFF
090340085	I BY NO MEANS WISH TO DIE
090340088	YOU CAN SEE THE REST
090340090	BUT WHAT ELSE HAD HE A RIGHT TO EXPECT
090340108	I HAVE MY OWN PLAN
090340114	I ASKED WAS THE CAUSE OF THE TROUBLE WAS
090340126	I AM NO LONGER A PARTNER IN THE HOUSE
090340131	IT WAS MY SECRET AND HERS
090340155	BUT IN THIS WORLD WE MUST CONSIDER OTHERS
090340158	NOT ALL THAT MUCH ANYWAY
090340164	HAVE YOU HAD SIGHT OF ANYTHING
090340168	THEY REMAINED THREE HOURS AT TABLE TELLING ABOUT THEIR SPORT
090700006	HE COULD NOT SEE HIMSELF
090700008	ONE TWICE AND THE THIRD TIME DEATH
090700019	I MUST START AT ONCE
090700042	I WOULD NOT HAVE HIM BACK AGAIN IF I COULD
090700045	AN IMPORTANT PRODUCT SUCH AS THIS
090700047	MIGHT I ASK YOUR NAME
090700054	HOWEVER THERE'S NO HELP FOR IT
090700055	WOULD IT NOT BE POSSIBLE TO FIND SUCH
090700057	HERE WE ARE THEN ALL SEATED ROUND THE TABLE
090700059	IN CHURCH AND WAITING ON TRAINS LIKE
090700065	THIS WAS THE PLAN THAT SUGGESTED ITSELF
090700081	THEY ARE OUT OF THE REACH OF ACCIDENT
090700082	THEY LIVED ON PUBLIC DEATH
090700108	HE MIGHT MARRY A GIRL WITH MONEY
090700111	AT LAST HOWEVER THE PARTY WAS MADE UP
090700117	I AM AFRAID HE WILL LEAVE US WITHOUT PITY
090700127	THIS SHALL BE THE PRICE OF HIS LIFE
090700148	THE COUNTRY IS PLEASANT FOR EXERCISE
090700164	I HAD AN APPOINTMENT HERE AT HALF PAST NIGHT
090700172	I THINK WE SHOULD BUILD GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM
095560005	I WANT TO BE ON THE SPOT TO HELP
095560008	HE MUST CONSIDER WHAT TO DO NEXT
095560010	SHALL I FEET HIM DOWN
095560017	MY FATHER THINKS TO PAINT THEM
095560031	NOTHING COULD TRUE HIM FROM HIS PURPOSE
095560037	DO NOT BE ANXIOUS ALL IS WHERE
095560051	HOWEVER HE PULLED HIMSELF TOGETHER QUICKLY
095560054	HOW PLEASANT HER MANNER IS
095560069	THE HANDS POINTED FOR FOUR OH CLOTH
095560080	DO NOT EXPECT SO MUCH FOR MY KINDNESS
095560083	HOWEVER I KNOW WHAT HIS ADVICE JUST NOW WOULD BE
095560108	THESE WORDS CHEERED ME UP
095560115	WE SHELL HAVE A SOME TROUBLE
095560129	THERE WILL PROBABLY BE NONE
095560133	HE AND HIS BROTHER SEEMED TO CHANGE PLACES
095560150	HE WAS NOT A PROPER PARTNER FOR HER
095560153	I THOUGHT IT MIGHT HAVE A REACHED YOUR AIRS
095560163	I MIGHT AS WELL GO
095560164	WHEN I SEE IT REACH YOUR HAND I FINE
095560170	OH HOW PAINFUL ALL THIS IS
096000002	BUT IT IS STILL ONLY THE FIRST QUARTER
096000003	AND FOR ALL YOU KNOW YOU COULD BE RIGHT
096000004	WE ARE GOING TO KILL THEM BUT NOT THAT WAY
096000005	I HAVE LOOKED WITH MY VERY EYES ON HELL
096000006	IT WAS LIKE THEY WERE LOST OR SOMETHING
096000007	HE MADE NO MOVE IT WOULD COME WHAT WOULD COME
096000008	HE WAS THERE WHEN HIS BEST FRIEND ASKED HER OUT
096000009	WHAT WAS HE EVEN ABOUT TO SAY
096000010	I THOUGHT I WOULD NEVER SMILE AGAIN
096000011	YOU AND I WANT THE SAME THING
096000012	THIS WAS THE MAN WHO HAD KILLED HIS FATHER
096000013	THEN I SAW HIM AT ONCE
096000014	I MUST HAVE WALKED INTO IT
096000015	HE PUT HIS OTHER HAND ON THE WALL AS WELL
096000016	BUT I WAS YOUNG THEN AND A LITTLE TOO CURIOUS
096000017	SHE'S LEFT ME HERE TO FACE HIM ON MY OWN
096000018	SHE OPENED THE DOOR AND LOOKED AROUND THE BATHROOM
096000020	I DO THOUGH AND I AM TRYING TO MAKE DO
096000021	IT WAS NOT LIKE SHE HAD ANY POWER OVER ANYTHING
096000022	SHE SHOULD BE THERE IN ABOUT AN HOUR
