lbi-7850-111771-0000 THROUGH THE INFLUENCE OF HON THOMAS L HAMER HE WAS ADMITTED AT WEST POINT IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY NINE
lbi-7850-111771-0001 AT THIS TIME GRANT WAS NOT TAKEN WITH WAR AND PROBABLY EVINCED LITTLE INTEREST IN ARMY TACTICS
lbi-7850-111771-0002 GRANT ACTED AS MUSTERING OFFICER UNTIL BEING COMMISSIONED COLONEL OF THE TWENTY FIRST ILLINOIS VOLUNTEERS HE TOOK THE FIELD
lbi-7850-111771-0003 GENERAL HALLECK IN SPEAKING OF THIS BATTLE SAID
lbi-7850-111771-0004 INDEED IF EVER A GENERAL DESERVED HONOR GRANT HAD WON IT HE HAD OPENED THE MISSISSIPPI TO NAVIGATION AND HAD CAPTURED NEARLY ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PRISONERS AND ARMS
lbi-7850-111771-0005 HE WAS NOW COMMANDER OF ALL THE FEDERAL FORCES
lbi-7850-111771-0006 THE CAPTURE OF LEE WAS A FAR MORE DIFFICULT UNDERTAKING
lbi-7850-111771-0007 TIME WORE AWAY AND ON THE NINTH OF APRIL EIGHTEEN SIXTY FIVE GRANT CAPTURED THE CONFEDERATE ARMY UNDER LEE THUS VIRTUALLY ENDING THE WAR
lbi-7850-111771-0008 WHEN HIS PUBLIC SERVICES WERE FINISHED HE STARTED IN COMPANY WITH HIS WIFE SON JESSE AND A FEW FRIENDS
lbi-7850-111771-0009 HIS SUCCESS SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN THE OUTGROWTH OF HARD STUDY AND ABILITY TO PERFORM THE MOST EXHAUSTIVE LABOR WITHOUT FATIGUE
lbi-7850-281318-0000 SOME ARE WONDERFULLY WROUGHT PRETTY LITTLE HOMES FOR BIRDIKINS
lbi-7850-281318-0001 INDEED IT IS NOT A NEST AT ALL ONLY THE BEGINNING OF ONE
lbi-7850-281318-0002 AND THERE IS AN OLD STORY ABOUT THIS WHICH I SHALL TELL YOU
lbi-7850-281318-0003 OH WHAT SHALL WE DO FOR A HOME
lbi-7850-281318-0004 AND THE POOR SILLY THINGS RUFFLED UP THEIR FEATHERS AND LOOKED MISERABLE AS ONLY A LITTLE BIRD CAN LOOK WHEN IT IS UNHAPPY
lbi-7850-281318-0005 SHE WAS INDEED A CLEVER BIRD
lbi-7850-281318-0006 SHE POPPED INTO HER NEW HOUSE AND SAT THERE COMFORTABLY PEERING OUT THROUGH THE WINDOW SLITS WITH HER SHARP LITTLE EYES
lbi-7850-281318-0007 AND SHE SAW THE OTHER BIRDS HOPPING ABOUT AND TWITTERING HELPLESSLY
lbi-7850-281318-0008 THEN ALL THE OTHER BIRDS CHIRPED EAGERLY YES YES LET US ASK HER TO TEACH US
lbi-7850-281318-0009 SO IN A GREAT COMPANY THEY CAME FLUTTERING HOPPING TWITTERING UP TO THE ELM TREE WHERE MOTHER MAGPIE NESTLED COMFORTABLY IN HER NEW HOUSE
lbi-7850-281318-0010 O WISE MOTHER MAGPIE DEAR MOTHER MAGPIE THEY CRIED TEACH US HOW TO BUILD OUR NESTS LIKE YOURS FOR IT IS GROWING NIGHT AND WE ARE TIRED AND SLEEPY
lbi-7850-281318-0011 THE MAGPIE SAID SHE WOULD TEACH THEM IF THEY WOULD BE A PATIENT DILIGENT OBEDIENT CLASS OF LITTLE BIRDS
lbi-7850-281318-0012 AND WHERE EACH BIRD PERCHED THERE IT WAS TO BUILD ITS NEST
lbi-7850-281318-0013 SHE BEGAN TO SHOW THEM HOW TO WEAVE THE BITS OF THINGS TOGETHER INTO NESTS AS THEY SHOULD BE MADE
lbi-7850-281318-0014 AND SOME OF THE BIRDS WHO WERE ATTENTIVE AND CAREFUL SOON SAW HOW IT WAS DONE AND STARTED NICE HOMES FOR THEMSELVES
lbi-7850-281318-0015 I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE WAY TO BEGIN
lbi-7850-281318-0016 CERTAINLY OF COURSE SCREAMED THE JACKDAW
lbi-7850-281318-0017 HERE WOOD PIGEON SAID MOTHER MAGPIE YOU MUST PLACE THOSE STICKS THROUGH AND ACROSS CRISS CROSS CRISS CROSS SO
lbi-7850-281318-0018 CRISS CROSS CRISS CROSS SO INTERRUPTED THE WOOD PIGEON
lbi-7850-281318-0019 YOU SAY YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT IT THEN GO ON AND FINISH YOUR NESTS BY YOURSELVES
lbi-7850-281318-0020 MUCH LUCK MAY YOU HAVE
lbi-7850-281318-0021 AND AWAY SHE FLEW TO HER OWN COSY NEST IN THE ELM TREE WHERE SHE WAS SOON FAST ASLEEP FORGETTING ALL ABOUT THE MATTER
lbi-7850-281318-0022 BUT THE WOOD PIGEON WAS IN THE WORST CASE OF THEM ALL
lbi-7850-281318-0023 FOR SHE HAD ONLY THE FOUNDATION LAID CRISS CROSS AS THE MAGPIE HAD SHOWN HER
lbi-7850-286674-0000 A PERSON WOULD THINK THAT AFTER A FAMILY HAD LIVED SO LONG IN A PLACE ALL THE NEIGHBORS WOULD BE FOND OF THEM YET IT IS NOT SO
lbi-7850-286674-0001 IT IS DISGRACEFUL
lbi-7850-286674-0002 THEY THOUGHT THE TROUBLE CAME FROM BAD BRINGING UP OR NO BRINGING UP AT ALL
lbi-7850-286674-0003 THEY ALWAYS ATE PLAIN FOOD AND PLENTY OF IT AND THEY NEVER ATE BETWEEN MEALS
lbi-7850-286674-0004 YOU WOULD THINK THAT WITH SIX LEGS APIECE AND THREE JOINTS IN EACH LEG THEY MIGHT WALK QUITE FAST YET THEY NEVER DID
lbi-7850-286674-0005 THEY DID NOT BREATHE IT INTO THEIR MOUTHS OR THROUGH GILLS BUT TOOK IT IN THROUGH SOME OPENINGS IN THE BACK PART OF THEIR BODIES
lbi-7850-286674-0006 BOTH LIPS ASKED THE LARVAE
lbi-7850-286674-0007 WELL OUR LOWER LIPS ANYWAY ANSWERED THE NYMPH
lbi-7850-286674-0008 OUR UPPER LIPS ARE SO SMALL THEY DON'T MATTER
lbi-7850-286674-0009 THEY KNEW THAT WHENEVER THEY STUCK OUT THEIR LOWER LIPS AT THE SMALL FISHES AND BUGS THEY SWAM AWAY AS FAST AS THEY COULD
lbi-7850-286674-0010 INDEED THE LOWER LIP OF A DRAGON FLY CHILD MIGHT WELL FRIGHTEN PEOPLE FOR IT IS FASTENED ON A LONG JOINTED ARM LIKE THING AND HAS PINCERS ON IT WITH WHICH IT CATCHES AND HOLDS ITS FOOD
lbi-7850-286674-0011 BUT SOMETIMES HE STRAIGHTENS THE JOINT AND HOLDS HIS LIP OUT BEFORE HIM AND THEN ITS PINCERS CATCH HOLD OF THINGS HE DOES THIS WHEN HE IS HUNGRY
lbi-7850-286674-0012 SCARED DAH WHO'S AFRAID ANSWERED HE
lbi-7850-286674-0013 HERE COMES THE SNAPPING TURTLE
lbi-7850-286674-0014 SURE ENOUGH THERE HE CAME THROUGH THE SHALLOW WATER HIS WET BACK SHELL PARTLY OUT OF IT AND SHINING IN THE SUNLIGHT
lbi-7850-286674-0015 THEY THOUGHT HE MIGHT BE GOING TO TAKE A NAP AFTER HIS DINNER
lbi-7850-286674-0016 HE BEGAN TO DRAW IN HIS LEGS VERY VERY SLOWLY AND JUST AS HIS GREAT HARD LOWER SHELL TOUCHED THE MUD THE LAST LARVA CRAWLED OUT UNDER HIS TAIL
lbi-7850-286674-0017 THE NYMPHS HAD ALREADY GOTTEN AWAY
lbi-7850-73752-0000 FERDINAND MEDITATES OVER HIS GOOD FORTUNE
lbi-7850-73752-0001 IN MOMENTS OF DEEP FEELING ALIKE SUDDEN BURSTS OF PROSPERITY AS IN DARKER HOURS MAN MUST BE ALONE
lbi-7850-73752-0002 IT REQUIRES SOME SELF COMMUNION TO PREPARE OURSELVES FOR GOOD FORTUNE AS WELL AS TO ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTY AND DANGER AND DISGRACE
lbi-7850-73752-0003 THIS VIOLENT AND TRIUMPHANT REVOLUTION IN HIS PROSPECTS AND HIS FORTUNES WAS HARDLY YET COMPLETELY COMPREHENDED BY OUR FRIEND FERDINAND ARMINE AND WHEN HE HAD LEFT A NOTE FOR THE GENEROUS MIRABEL WHOSE SLUMBERS HE WOULD NOT DISTURB AT THIS EARLY HOUR EVEN WITH GOOD NEWS HE STROLLED ALONG UP CHARLES STREET AND TO THE PARK IN ONE OF THOSE WILD AND JOYOUS REVERIES IN WHICH WE BROOD OVER COMING BLISS AND CREATE A THOUSAND GLORIOUS CONSEQUENCES
lbi-7850-73752-0004 FERDINAND FELT HIS FREEDOM AS WELL AS HIS HAPPINESS
lbi-7850-73752-0005 IT WAS INDEED HER HANDWRITING
lbi-7850-73752-0006 RESTLESS WITH IMPENDING JOY HE SAUNTERED TO THE BRIDGE AND LEANT OVER THE BALUSTRADE GAZING ON THE WATERS IN CHARMED AND CHARMING VACANCY
lbi-7850-73752-0007 HOW MANY INCIDENTS HOW MANY CHARACTERS HOW MANY FEELINGS FLITTED OVER HIS MEMORY OF WHAT SWEET AND BITTER EXPERIENCE DID HE NOT CHEW THE CUD
lbi-7850-73752-0008 FOUR AND TWENTY HOURS AGO AND HE DEEMED HIMSELF THE MOST MISERABLE AND FORLORN OF HUMAN BEINGS AND NOW ALL THE BLESSINGS OF THE WORLD SEEMED SHOWERED AT HIS FEET
lbi-7850-73752-0009 THE MOST GIFTED INDIVIDUALS IN THE LAND EMULATED EACH OTHER IN PROVING WHICH ENTERTAINED FOR HIM THE MOST SINCERE AFFECTION
lbi-7850-73752-0010 HE COULD NOT FLATTER HIMSELF THAT HE INDEED MERITED SUCH SINGULAR BLESSINGS AND YET WITH ALL HIS FAULTS WHICH WITH HIM WERE BUT THE CONSEQUENCES OF HIS FIERY YOUTH FERDINAND HAD BEEN FAITHFUL TO HENRIETTA
lbi-7850-73752-0011 HIS CONSTANCY TO HER WAS NOW REWARDED
lbi-7850-73752-0012 AS FOR HIS FRIENDS THE FUTURE MUST PROVE HIS GRATITUDE TO THEM
lbi-7850-73752-0013 IT WAS INDEED DANCING ON A VOLCANO
lbi-7850-73752-0014 AND NOW ALL HAD ENDED SO HAPPILY
lbi-7850-73752-0015 WAS IT NOT ALL A DREAM OF HIS OWN CREATION WHILE HIS EYE HAD BEEN FIXED IN ABSTRACTION ON THAT BRIGHT AND FLOWING RIVER
lbi-7850-73752-0016 HE MIGHT BE ENCHANTED BUT THAT WAS THE TALISMAN
lbi-7850-73752-0017 IN THE PRESENT UNSETTLED THOUGH HOPEFUL STATE OF AFFAIRS FERDINAND WOULD NOT GO HOME
lbi-7850-73752-0018 IN EXACTLY TEN MINUTES IT IS IN THE POWER OF EVERY MAN TO FREE HIMSELF FROM ALL THE TUMULT OF THE WORLD THE PANGS OF LOVE THE THROBS OF AMBITION THE WEAR AND TEAR OF PLAY THE RECRIMINATING BOUDOIR THE CONSPIRING CLUB THE RATTLING HELL AND FIND HIMSELF IN A SUBLIME SYLVAN SOLITUDE SUPERIOR TO THE CEDARS OF LEBANON AND INFERIOR ONLY IN EXTENT TO THE CHESTNUT FORESTS OF ANATOLIA
lbi-7850-73752-0019 IS PAPA ALONE ENQUIRED MISS TEMPLE
lbi-7976-105575-0000 GRANT WAS ONLY A FEW MILES AWAY BUT ALTHOUGH COMMANDER IN CHIEF HE KNEW NOTHING OF THE HARDEST FOUGHT BATTLE OF THE CIVIL WAR UNTIL IT WAS OVER
lbi-7976-105575-0001 MY OWN REGIMENT WAS IN THE ADVANCE
lbi-7976-105575-0002 OUR BRIGADE WAS FEARFULLY OUTNUMBERED
lbi-7976-105575-0003 THERE WERE NO BREASTWORKS YET THAT ONE LITTLE BRIGADE OF HAMILTON'S DIVISION STOOD THERE IN THE OPEN AND REPULSED ASSAULT AFTER ASSAULT
lbi-7976-105575-0004 NOT BALAKLAVA NOR THE ALMA SAW SUCH FIGHTING IT WAS A DUEL TO THE DEATH
lbi-7976-105575-0005 NO BATTERY IN THE WHOLE FOUR YEARS WAR LOST SO MANY MEN IN SO SHORT A TIME
lbi-7976-105575-0006 ONE DARING REBEL WAS SHOT DOWN AND BAYONETED CLEAR BEHIND THE LINE OF COMPANY B WHERE HE HAD BROKEN THROUGH TO SEIZE THE FLAG OF MY REGIMENT
lbi-7976-105575-0007 THAT NIGHT THE ENEMY SLIPPED AWAY LEAVING HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF HIS DEAD AND WOUNDED ON THE FIELD
lbi-7976-105575-0008 WITH A FEW LANTERNS OUR MEN THEN WENT ABOUT AND TRIED TO GATHER UP THE WOUNDED THE DEAD WERE LEFT TILL MORNING
lbi-7976-105575-0009 IT WAS NOT A QUESTION WHO WAS DEAD OR WOUNDED BUT WHO WAS NOT
lbi-7976-105575-0010 FIFTEEN OFFICERS OF OUR LITTLE HALF REGIMENT WERE DEAD OR WOUNDED
lbi-7976-105575-0011 I REMAINED AWAKE ALL NIGHT TALKING WITH A COMRADE WHO SHARED MY BLANKET WITH ME POOR JIMMY KING
lbi-7976-105575-0012 HE SURVIVED THE WAR ONLY TO BE MURDERED LATER ON A PLANTATION IN MISSISSIPPI
lbi-7976-105575-0013 WHEN MORNING CAME THE FIRING OPENED AND FOR ALL THAT DAY THE BATTLE RAGED FIERCELY AT THE LEFT AND CENTER LEFT WE GETTING THE WORST OF IT TOO
lbi-7976-105575-0014 THAT EVENING AN ORDER CAME FOR US HAMILTON'S DIVISION TO ASSAULT THE ENEMY'S LEFT FLANK AT MIDNIGHT
lbi-7976-105575-0015 UNDER THE SAME QUIET MOONLIGHT AND ONLY SIX HUNDRED YARDS AWAY FROM US ALSO LAY THE VICTORIOUS REBEL ARMY
lbi-7976-105575-0016 ONCE IN THE NIGHT I SLIPPED AWAY FROM THE BIVOUAC AND HURRIED TO THE OLD TISHIMINGO HOTEL TO SEE A LIEUTENANT OF MY COMPANY WHO HAD BEEN SHOT THROUGH THE BREAST
lbi-7976-105575-0017 I COULD NOT HELP MY FRIEND
lbi-7976-105575-0018 GO BACK TO THE REGIMENT HE SAID SMILING ALL WILL BE NEEDED
lbi-7976-105575-0019 MY FRIEND WITH MANY OTHERS WAS BEING CARRIED OUT TO DIE ELSEWHERE
lbi-7976-105575-0020 I HASTENED BACK TO THE LINES
lbi-7976-105575-0021 THE CLOUD OF REBELS WE HAD SEEN DIVIDED ITSELF INTO THREE COLUMNS
lbi-7976-105575-0022 A PERFECT BLAZE OF CLOSE RANGE MUSKETRY TOO MOWED THEM DOWN LIKE GRASS
lbi-7976-105575-0023 THEY LAY IN HEAPS OF DOZENS EVEN CLOSE UP TO THE WORKS
lbi-7976-105575-0024 THAT NIGHT I STOOD GUARD UNDER AN OAK TREE ON THE BATTLEFIELD AMONG THE UNBURIED DEAD
lbi-7976-105575-0025 INDEED WE OF THE RANK AND FILE HAD LITTLE CONFIDENCE IN GRANT IN THOSE DAYS
lbi-7976-105575-0026 ROSECRANS PROTESTED IT WAS IN VAIN
lbi-7976-105575-0027 IT REQUIRED MONTHS AND GREAT EVENTS TO MAKE GRANT THE HERO OF THE ARMY WHICH HE AFTERWARD BECAME
lbi-7976-105575-0028 FOR SOME REASON THE DEAD AT HATCHIE BRIDGE WERE NOT BURIED
lbi-7976-105575-0029 A WEEK AFTER THE BATTLE MY BROTHER RODE BY THERE ON A CAVALRY EXPEDITION AND MADE THE HORRIBLE DISCOVERY THAT HOGS WERE EATING UP THE BODIES OF OUR DEAD HEROES THAT TOO WAS WAR
