096010001	THERE WAS NO WAY SHE COULD USE IT
096010002	HE PUT DOWN HIS STERN AND LOOKED AGAIN
096010004	SHE OPENED HER EYES STARING UP AT HIM
096010005	BUT HE CAN DO THINGS BUT THIS
096010006	I WONDER THAT WE WERE STILL SO LONG
096010007	YOU MAY NOT WANT TO KNOW
096010008	SO HE CALLED AND ASKED ONE MORE TIME
096010009	AND THEN THERE WAS SILENCE FOR A MOMENT OR TWO
096010010	SHE TURNED AWAY FROM ME AND SUDDENLY BACK
096010011	THAT YOU LOVE ME AS MUCH AS I LOVE YOU
096010012	IT WAS SIMPLE ENOUGH IF THEY HAD ONLY THOUGHT
096010013	WHAT HE SAW ABOUT HER THAT MADE HER SPECIAL
096010015	I TAKE THE TIME TO LOOK THE DOG OVER
096010016	HE IS THE BEST COOK IN THE WORLD TOO
096010018	THE OTHER WAS A GIRL AS WELL
096010019	THEY WALKED THE REST OF THE DAY AND ALL NIGHT
096010020	SOMEWHERE THERE HAD TO BE A PLACE BETTER THAN THIS
096010021	HE SHRUGGED ME OFF LIKE I WAS NOTHING
096010022	IT IS NOT THE FACE HE KNOWS THOUGH
096010023	YOU FEEL LIKE A LITTLE BROTHER TO ME
096080003	YOU MUST NOT THINK OF THE PAST NOW
096080005	SHE WISHED THAT SHE HAD NEVER COME HERE
096080006	THEY WERE ALREADY IN AND SEEMED LIKE THEY SAW NOTHING
096080007	THE SAME LOOK OF CONFUSION IS ON HIS FACE
096080008	THERE WAS NO WAY WE COULD GET OUT
096080009	BUT STILL I WOULD DO MY BEST
096080010	SO THIS WAS ALL OVER HIM
096080012	AND THERE SHE WAS WITH ANOTHER MAN
096080013	I KNOW YOU JUST AS WELL AS YOU KNOW YOURSELF
096080014	IT WAS SOMETHING MORE THAN THAT
096080015	SHE HAVE TO MAKE UP THINGS IF EVER
096080017	SHE CLOSED HER EYES AND THOUGHT BACK
096080018	WE TALKED ALL NIGHT AGAIN ABOUT THIS AND THAT
096080021	WHAT WAS THERE AFTER THIS WHICH HE MIGHT NOT DO
096080022	HE REACHED FOR HER HAND SHE LET HIM TAKE IT
096080023	I SUPPOSE IT IS BETTER THAT YOU SHOULD TELL ME
096080024	THE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE RESTAURANT WERE LOOKING AT US
096080025	HE WATCHES ME DAY IN AND DAY OUT
096080026	THAT WAS THE LAST TIME I SAW MY FATHER
096080027	YOU HAVE TO CHANGE WITH THEM OR BE LEFT BEHIND
096100001	SHE WAS FACE TO FACE WITH ONE OF THE HORSE
096100002	BUT HOW COULD SHE HAVE NOT KNOWN THAT
096100003	ACTUALLY THERE IS SOMETHING YOU CAN DO FOR ME
096100004	HE PULLED IT OUT AND LOOKED AT IT
096100005	SHOULD I KNOW HER AGAIN IF I SAW HER
096100006	AND THEN HE HAD A BETTER IDEA
096100007	COULD THIS GIRL BE LIKE HIM IN SOME WAY
096100008	IT WAS STILL ON HIS BACK
096100009	WE ALL WERE A LITTLE
096100010	SHE JUST NEVER WANTED TO TALK ABOUT IT EVEN NOW
096100011	I MADE UP MY MIND TO GO AT ONCE
096100012	NONE OF THEM HAD THOUGHT TO LOOK BEHIND THE DOOR
096100013	IF SO WHAT WAS IT
096100014	THIS TIME I WAS RIGHT
096100015	HE TURNED HIS HEAD AWAY FROM HER
096100016	I ACTUALLY THINK WE MIGHT MAKE IT OUT OF THIS
096100017	THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT FOR ME
096100018	WHAT KIND OF PERSON WOULD SHE COME TO BE
096100019	IT WAS WHEN I WAS VERY YOUNG
096100020	I ASKED TO BE SURE
096120001	SHE SAW IT ALL IN A MOMENT
096120002	I WANT TO SEE HIM MYSELF
096120003	THERE WAS REALLY NO WINNING WITH HER WAS THERE
096120004	AND THEN SOMETHING KNOCKED ME OUT OF THE WAY
096120005	HE HAD THOUGHT THEY WOULD NEVER COME BACK
096120006	BUT WHAT TRICK DO YOU HAVE FOR US NOW
096120007	IT IS GOING TO BE SO MUCH FUN
096120008	I LOOKED OVER AT THEM
096120009	IF SHE WANTED TO SHE COULD BE VERY POPULAR
096120010	THEY HAD TO LET GO
096120011	BUT WE LOOKED LIKE THAT A LONG LONG TIME AGO
096120012	HE TURNED AROUND AND WALKED AWAY TO THE PLATFORM
096120013	I AM A PLAIN MAN AND SAY WHAT I THINK
096120014	THIS WAS THE PLACE ALL RIGHT
096120015	HE SHOULD BE ABLE TO SEE IT FROM HERE
096120016	HE WAS STILL AT HOME
096120017	HE ASKED HER ONE DAY
096120018	SHE HAD NOTHING BETTER TO DO THAT NIGHT
096120019	HE WAS FACE TO FACE WITH THE GIRL
096120020	BUT THAT IS AT AN END
096170001	SHE WAS JUST LIKE HE WAS
096170002	THEN ON OUT THE BACK DOOR OF THE HOUSE
096170003	HE LOOKED HERE AND THERE
096170004	YOU MAY NOT BE WHO YOU THINK YOU ARE
096170006	BUT NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME SOMETHING HAD MESSED UP
096170007	AND ONCE MORE SHE WAS ALL HIS OWN
096170008	IT NEVER HAPPENED AND IT NEVER WILL
096170009	THEY ALL GIVE THEM TO HIM
096170010	THERE WAS NO OTHER WAY AROUND IT
096170011	THIS WAS THE THING SHE WANTED TO HEAR ONLY THIS
096170012	WE ARE GOING TO DO NOTHING ABOUT IT
096170013	NO DOUBT HE WAS VERY GOOD AND ALL THAT
096170014	SHE WALKED OUT OF THE ROOM AGAIN
096170015	HE TURNED AND ASKED THEM
096170018	HE WAS TALENTED IN MORE THINGS THAN I WAS
096170020	SHE WAS LOOKING AWAY FROM HIM AT THE FIRE
096170021	SO THAT IS WHAT I WANT TO BE CALLED
096170022	AND EVEN AFTER THAT IT IS NOT MUCH BETTER
096170023	I LEFT THIS PLACE BECAUSE OF HIM
096170024	NOW SHE HAD TO DO THE SAME
