lbi-700-122866-0000 JUNIOR AVONLEA FOUND IT HARD TO SETTLE DOWN TO HUMDRUM EXISTENCE AGAIN
lbi-700-122866-0001 PERHAPS AFTER A WHILE I'LL GET USED TO IT BUT I'M AFRAID CONCERTS SPOIL PEOPLE FOR EVERYDAY LIFE
lbi-700-122866-0002 I SUPPOSE THAT IS WHY MARILLA DISAPPROVES OF THEM
lbi-700-122866-0003 I FEEL JUST NOW THAT I MAY GROW UP TO BE SENSIBLE YET
lbi-700-122866-0004 I JUST LAY AWAKE AND IMAGINED THE CONCERT OVER AND OVER AGAIN
lbi-700-122866-0005 EVENTUALLY HOWEVER AVONLEA SCHOOL SLIPPED BACK INTO ITS OLD GROOVE AND TOOK UP ITS OLD INTERESTS
lbi-700-122866-0006 NONE OF THE SLOANES WOULD HAVE ANY DEALINGS WITH THE BELLS BECAUSE THE BELLS HAD DECLARED THAT THE SLOANES HAD TOO MUCH TO DO IN THE PROGRAM AND THE SLOANES HAD RETORTED THAT THE BELLS WERE NOT CAPABLE OF DOING THE LITTLE THEY HAD TO DO PROPERLY
lbi-700-122866-0007 THE WINTER WEEKS SLIPPED BY
lbi-700-122866-0008 ON ANNE'S BIRTHDAY THEY WERE TRIPPING LIGHTLY DOWN IT KEEPING EYES AND EARS ALERT AMID ALL THEIR CHATTER FOR MISS STACY HAD TOLD THEM THAT THEY MUST SOON WRITE A COMPOSITION ON A WINTER'S WALK IN THE WOODS AND IT BEHOOVED THEM TO BE OBSERVANT
lbi-700-122866-0009 I CAN SCARCELY REALIZE THAT I'M IN MY TEENS
lbi-700-122866-0010 IT'S A GREAT COMFORT TO THINK THAT I'LL BE ABLE TO USE BIG WORDS THEN WITHOUT BEING LAUGHED AT
lbi-700-122866-0011 RUBY GILLIS THINKS OF NOTHING BUT BEAUS SAID ANNE DISDAINFULLY
lbi-700-122866-0012 SHE'S ACTUALLY DELIGHTED WHEN ANYONE WRITES HER NAME UP IN A TAKE NOTICE FOR ALL SHE PRETENDS TO BE SO MAD
lbi-700-122866-0013 I'M TRYING TO BE AS MUCH LIKE MISSUS ALLAN AS I POSSIBLY CAN FOR I THINK SHE'S PERFECT
lbi-700-122866-0014 IF I HAD ALICE BELL'S CROOKED NOSE SAID ANNE DECIDEDLY I WOULDN'T BUT THERE
lbi-700-122866-0015 I'M AFRAID I THINK TOO MUCH ABOUT MY NOSE EVER SINCE I HEARD THAT COMPLIMENT ABOUT IT LONG AGO
lbi-700-122866-0016 OH DIANA LOOK THERE'S A RABBIT
lbi-700-122866-0017 THEY'RE SO WHITE AND STILL AS IF THEY WERE ASLEEP AND DREAMING PRETTY DREAMS
lbi-700-122866-0018 I WROTE IT LAST MONDAY EVENING
lbi-700-122866-0019 IT'S CALLED THE JEALOUS RIVAL OR IN DEATH NOT DIVIDED
lbi-700-122866-0020 I READ IT TO MARILLA AND SHE SAID IT WAS STUFF AND NONSENSE
lbi-700-122866-0021 IT'S A SAD SWEET STORY
lbi-700-122866-0022 CORDELIA WAS A REGAL BRUNETTE WITH A CORONET OF MIDNIGHT HAIR AND DUSKLY FLASHING EYES
lbi-700-122866-0023 YOU KNOW SO MUCH MORE THAN YOU DID WHEN YOU WERE ONLY TWELVE
lbi-700-122866-0024 THEY GREW IN BEAUTY SIDE BY SIDE UNTIL THEY WERE SIXTEEN
lbi-700-122866-0025 I ASKED RUBY GILLIS IF SHE KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT HOW MEN PROPOSED BECAUSE I THOUGHT SHE'D LIKELY BE AN AUTHORITY ON THE SUBJECT HAVING SO MANY SISTERS MARRIED
lbi-700-122866-0026 BUT SHE PRETENDED TO BE GERALDINE'S FRIEND THE SAME AS EVER
lbi-700-122866-0027 LET YOU AND ME HAVE A STORY CLUB ALL OUR OWN AND WRITE STORIES FOR PRACTICE
lbi-700-122866-0028 YOU OUGHT TO CULTIVATE YOUR IMAGINATION YOU KNOW MISS STACY SAYS SO
lbi-700-122866-0029 ONLY WE MUST TAKE THE RIGHT WAY
lbi-700-122866-0030 THIS WAS HOW THE STORY CLUB CAME INTO EXISTENCE
lbi-700-122866-0031 NO BOYS WERE ALLOWED IN IT ALTHOUGH RUBY GILLIS OPINED THAT THEIR ADMISSION WOULD MAKE IT MORE EXCITING AND EACH MEMBER HAD TO PRODUCE ONE STORY A WEEK
lbi-700-122866-0032 EACH GIRL HAS TO READ HER STORY OUT LOUD AND THEN WE TALK IT OVER
lbi-700-122866-0033 MINE IS ROSAMOND MONTMORENCY ALL THE GIRLS DO PRETTY WELL
lbi-700-122866-0034 I'M SURE THAT MUST HAVE A WHOLESOME EFFECT
lbi-700-122866-0035 THE MORAL IS THE GREAT THING MISTER ALLAN SAYS SO
lbi-700-122866-0036 I READ ONE OF MY STORIES TO HIM AND MISSUS ALLAN AND THEY BOTH AGREED THAT THE MORAL WAS EXCELLENT
lbi-700-122866-0037 JANE AND RUBY ALMOST ALWAYS CRY WHEN I COME TO THE PATHETIC PARTS
lbi-700-122866-0038 MISS JOSEPHINE BARRY WROTE BACK THAT SHE HAD NEVER READ ANYTHING SO AMUSING IN HER LIFE
lbi-700-122866-0039 I'M SURE MISSUS ALLAN WAS NEVER SUCH A SILLY FORGETFUL LITTLE GIRL AS YOU ARE
lbi-700-122866-0040 I FELT SO ENCOURAGED WHEN I HEARD THAT
lbi-700-122866-0041 MISSUS LYNDE SAYS SHE ALWAYS FEELS SHOCKED WHEN SHE HEARS OF ANYONE EVER HAVING BEEN NAUGHTY NO MATTER HOW SMALL THEY WERE
lbi-700-122866-0042 NOW I WOULDN'T HAVE FELT THAT WAY
lbi-700-122867-0000 VANITY AND VEXATION OF SPIRIT
lbi-700-122867-0001 THE SPRING WAS ABROAD IN THE LAND AND MARILLA'S SOBER MIDDLE AGED STEP WAS LIGHTER AND SWIFTER BECAUSE OF ITS DEEP PRIMAL GLADNESS
lbi-700-122867-0002 I MUST SAY WITH ALL HER FAULTS I NEVER FOUND HER DISOBEDIENT OR UNTRUSTWORTHY BEFORE AND I'M REAL SORRY TO FIND HER SO NOW
lbi-700-122867-0003 PERHAPS YOU'RE JUDGING HER TOO HASTY MARILLA
lbi-700-122867-0004 OF COURSE I KNEW YOU'D TAKE HER PART MATTHEW BUT I'M BRINGING HER UP NOT YOU
lbi-700-122867-0005 DEMANDED MARILLA ANXIOUSLY GOING OVER TO THE BED
lbi-700-122867-0006 ANNE COWERED DEEPER INTO HER PILLOWS AS IF DESIROUS OF HIDING HERSELF FOREVER FROM MORTAL EYES NO
lbi-700-122867-0007 GET RIGHT UP THIS MINUTE AND TELL ME
lbi-700-122867-0008 THIS MINUTE I SAY THERE NOW WHAT IS IT
lbi-700-122867-0009 ANNE HAD SLID TO THE FLOOR IN DESPAIRING OBEDIENCE
lbi-700-122867-0010 YES IT'S GREEN MOANED ANNE
lbi-700-122867-0011 I THOUGHT NOTHING COULD BE AS BAD AS RED HAIR
lbi-700-122867-0012 YOU HAVEN'T GOT INTO ANY SCRAPE FOR OVER TWO MONTHS AND I WAS SURE ANOTHER ONE WAS DUE
lbi-700-122867-0013 NOW THEN WHAT DID YOU DO TO YOUR HAIR
lbi-700-122867-0014 ANNE SHIRLEY DIDN'T YOU KNOW IT WAS A WICKED THING TO DO
lbi-700-122867-0015 YES I KNEW IT WAS A LITTLE WICKED ADMITTED ANNE
lbi-700-122867-0016 I KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO HAVE YOUR WORD DOUBTED
lbi-700-122867-0017 AND MISSUS ALLAN SAYS WE SHOULD NEVER SUSPECT ANYONE OF NOT TELLING US THE TRUTH UNLESS WE HAVE PROOF THAT THEY'RE NOT
lbi-700-122867-0018 BUT I HADN'T THEN AND I BELIEVED EVERY WORD HE SAID IMPLICITLY
lbi-700-122867-0019 WHO SAID WHO ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
lbi-700-122867-0020 OH I DIDN'T LET HIM IN THE HOUSE
lbi-700-122867-0021 IN A TRICE I SAW MYSELF WITH BEAUTIFUL RAVEN BLACK HAIR AND THE TEMPTATION WAS IRRESISTIBLE
lbi-700-122867-0022 OH MARILLA WHAT A TANGLED WEB WE WEAVE WHEN FIRST WE PRACTICE TO DECEIVE
lbi-700-122867-0023 YOUR HAIR MUST BE CUT OFF THERE IS NO OTHER WAY YOU CAN'T GO OUT WITH IT LOOKING LIKE THAT
lbi-700-122867-0024 WITH A DISMAL SIGH SHE WENT FOR THE SCISSORS
lbi-700-122867-0025 BUT THERE IS NOTHING COMFORTING IN HAVING YOUR HAIR CUT OFF BECAUSE YOU'VE DYED IT A DREADFUL COLOR IS THERE
lbi-700-122867-0026 I'M GOING TO WEEP ALL THE TIME YOU'RE CUTTING IT OFF IF IT WON'T INTERFERE
lbi-700-122867-0027 IT SEEMS SUCH A TRAGIC THING
lbi-700-122867-0028 ANNE WEPT THEN BUT LATER ON WHEN SHE WENT UPSTAIRS AND LOOKED IN THE GLASS SHE WAS CALM WITH DESPAIR
lbi-700-122867-0029 YES I WILL TOO
lbi-700-122867-0030 I NEVER THOUGHT I WAS VAIN ABOUT MY HAIR OF ALL THINGS BUT NOW I KNOW I WAS IN SPITE OF ITS BEING RED BECAUSE IT WAS SO LONG AND THICK AND CURLY
lbi-700-122867-0031 I EXPECT SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN TO MY NOSE NEXT
lbi-700-122867-0032 ANNE'S CLIPPED HEAD MADE A SENSATION IN SCHOOL ON THE FOLLOWING MONDAY BUT TO HER RELIEF NOBODY GUESSED THE REAL REASON FOR IT NOT EVEN JOSIE PYE WHO HOWEVER DID NOT FAIL TO INFORM ANNE THAT SHE LOOKED LIKE A PERFECT SCARECROW
lbi-700-122867-0033 IT'S HARD TO BE TOLD YOU LOOK LIKE A SCARECROW AND I WANTED TO SAY SOMETHING BACK BUT I DIDN'T
lbi-700-122867-0034 IT MAKES YOU FEEL VERY VIRTUOUS WHEN YOU FORGIVE PEOPLE DOESN'T IT
lbi-700-122867-0035 I MEAN TO DEVOTE ALL MY ENERGIES TO BEING GOOD AFTER THIS AND I SHALL NEVER TRY TO BE BEAUTIFUL AGAIN
lbi-700-122867-0036 OF COURSE IT'S BETTER TO BE GOOD
lbi-700-122867-0037 I DO REALLY WANT TO BE GOOD MARILLA LIKE YOU AND MISSUS ALLAN AND MISS STACY AND GROW UP TO BE A CREDIT TO YOU
lbi-700-122867-0038 DIANA SAYS WHEN MY HAIR BEGINS TO GROW TO TIE A BLACK VELVET RIBBON AROUND MY HEAD WITH A BOW AT ONE SIDE
lbi-700-122867-0039 I WILL CALL IT A SNOOD THAT SOUNDS SO ROMANTIC
lbi-700-122867-0040 MY HEAD IS BETTER NOW
lbi-700-122867-0041 IT WAS TERRIBLE BAD THIS AFTERNOON THOUGH
lbi-700-122868-0000 OF COURSE YOU MUST BE ELAINE ANNE SAID DIANA
lbi-700-122868-0001 OF COURSE IT WOULD BE ROMANTIC CONCEDED JANE ANDREWS BUT I KNOW I COULDN'T KEEP STILL
lbi-700-122868-0002 BUT IT'S SO RIDICULOUS TO HAVE A REDHEADED ELAINE MOURNED ANNE
lbi-700-122868-0003 AND ELAINE WAS THE LILY MAID
lbi-700-122868-0004 YOUR COMPLEXION IS JUST AS FAIR AS RUBY'S SAID DIANA EARNESTLY AND YOUR HAIR IS EVER SO MUCH DARKER THAN IT USED TO BE BEFORE YOU CUT IT
lbi-700-122868-0005 IT WAS SPLENDID TO FISH FOR TROUT OVER THE BRIDGE AND THE TWO GIRLS LEARNED TO ROW THEMSELVES ABOUT IN THE LITTLE FLAT BOTTOMED DORY MISTER BARRY KEPT FOR DUCK SHOOTING
lbi-700-122868-0006 IT WAS ANNE'S IDEA THAT THEY DRAMATIZE ELAINE
lbi-700-122868-0007 THOSE DAYS SHE SAID WERE SO MUCH MORE ROMANTIC THAN THE PRESENT
lbi-700-122868-0008 THEY HAD OFTEN GONE DOWN LIKE THIS AND NOTHING COULD BE MORE CONVENIENT FOR PLAYING ELAINE
lbi-700-122868-0009 THE BLACK SHAWL HAVING BEEN PROCURED ANNE SPREAD IT OVER THE FLAT AND THEN LAY DOWN ON THE BOTTOM WITH CLOSED EYES AND HANDS FOLDED OVER HER BREAST
lbi-700-122868-0010 IT SPOILS THE EFFECT BECAUSE THIS IS HUNDREDS OF YEARS BEFORE MISSUS LYNDE WAS BORN
lbi-700-122868-0011 JANE YOU ARRANGE THIS
lbi-700-122868-0012 IT'S SILLY FOR ELAINE TO BE TALKING WHEN SHE'S DEAD
lbi-700-122868-0013 JANE ROSE TO THE OCCASION
lbi-700-122868-0014 LEFT BEHIND AT THE LANDING
lbi-700-122868-0015 ANNE GAVE ONE GASPING LITTLE SCREAM WHICH NOBODY EVER HEARD SHE WAS WHITE TO THE LIPS BUT SHE DID NOT LOSE HER SELF POSSESSION
lbi-700-122868-0016 THERE WAS ONE CHANCE JUST ONE
lbi-700-122868-0017 UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES YOU DON'T THINK MUCH ABOUT MAKING A FLOWERY PRAYER
lbi-700-122868-0018 THE FLAT DRIFTED UNDER THE BRIDGE AND THEN PROMPTLY SANK IN MIDSTREAM
lbi-700-122868-0019 RUBY JANE AND DIANA ALREADY AWAITING IT ON THE LOWER HEADLAND SAW IT DISAPPEAR BEFORE THEIR VERY EYES AND HAD NOT A DOUBT BUT THAT ANNE HAD GONE DOWN WITH IT
lbi-700-122868-0020 THE MINUTES PASSED BY EACH SEEMING AN HOUR TO THE UNFORTUNATE LILY MAID
lbi-700-122868-0021 WHY DIDN'T SOMEBODY COME WHERE HAD THE GIRLS GONE
lbi-700-122868-0022 HER IMAGINATION BEGAN TO SUGGEST ALL MANNER OF GRUESOME POSSIBILITIES TO HER
lbi-700-122868-0023 ANNE SHIRLEY
lbi-700-122868-0024 HOW ON EARTH DID YOU GET THERE HE EXCLAIMED
lbi-700-122868-0025 IT WAS CERTAINLY EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO BE DIGNIFIED UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES
lbi-700-122868-0026 WHAT HAS HAPPENED ANNE
lbi-700-122868-0027 ASKED GILBERT TAKING UP HIS OARS
lbi-700-122868-0028 WE WERE PLAYING ELAINE EXPLAINED ANNE FRIGIDLY WITHOUT EVEN LOOKING AT HER RESCUER AND I HAD TO DRIFT DOWN TO CAMELOT IN THE BARGE I MEAN THE FLAT
lbi-700-122868-0029 FOR A MOMENT ANNE HESITATED
lbi-700-122868-0030 HER HEART GAVE A QUICK QUEER LITTLE BEAT
lbi-700-122868-0031 HER RESENTMENT WHICH TO OTHER AND OLDER PEOPLE MIGHT BE AS LAUGHABLE AS ITS CAUSE WAS IN NO WHIT ALLAYED AND SOFTENED BY TIME SEEMINGLY
lbi-700-122868-0032 NO SHE SAID COLDLY I SHALL NEVER BE FRIENDS WITH YOU GILBERT BLYTHE AND I DON'T WANT TO BE
lbi-700-122868-0033 ALL RIGHT
lbi-700-122868-0034 I'LL NEVER ASK YOU TO BE FRIENDS AGAIN ANNE SHIRLEY AND I DON'T CARE EITHER
lbi-700-122868-0035 OF COURSE HE HAD INSULTED HER TERRIBLY BUT STILL
lbi-700-122868-0036 EVERYTHING I DO GETS ME OR MY DEAREST FRIENDS INTO A SCRAPE
lbi-700-122868-0037 ANNE'S PRESENTIMENT PROVED MORE TRUSTWORTHY THAN PRESENTIMENTS ARE APT TO DO
lbi-700-122868-0038 WILL YOU EVER HAVE ANY SENSE ANNE GROANED MARILLA
lbi-700-122868-0039 I DON'T SEE HOW SAID MARILLA
lbi-700-122868-0040 EVER SINCE I CAME TO GREEN GABLES I'VE BEEN MAKING MISTAKES AND EACH MISTAKE HAS HELPED TO CURE ME OF SOME GREAT SHORTCOMING
lbi-7601-101619-0000 OUR EXTREMEST PLEASURE HAS SOME SORT OF GROANING AND COMPLAINING IN IT WOULD YOU NOT SAY THAT IT IS DYING OF PAIN
lbi-7601-101619-0001 THE HIGHEST AND FULLEST CONTENTMENT OFFERS MORE OF THE GRAVE THAN OF THE MERRY IPSA FELICITAS SE NISI TEMPERAT PREMIT EVEN FELICITY UNLESS IT MODERATE ITSELF OPPRESSES
lbi-7601-101619-0002 SOCRATES SAYS THAT SOME GOD TRIED TO MIX IN ONE MASS AND TO CONFOUND PAIN AND PLEASURE BUT NOT BEING ABLE TO DO IT HE BETHOUGHT HIM AT LEAST TO COUPLE THEM BY THE TAIL METRODORUS SAID THAT IN SORROW THERE IS SOME MIXTURE OF PLEASURE
lbi-7601-101619-0003 NATURE DISCOVERS THIS CONFUSION TO US PAINTERS HOLD THAT THE SAME MOTIONS AND GRIMACES OF THE FACE THAT SERVE FOR WEEPING SERVE FOR LAUGHTER TOO AND INDEED BEFORE THE ONE OR THE OTHER BE FINISHED DO BUT OBSERVE THE PAINTER'S MANNER OF HANDLING AND YOU WILL BE IN DOUBT TO WHICH OF THE TWO THE DESIGN TENDS AND THE EXTREME OF LAUGHTER DOES AT LAST BRING TEARS
lbi-7601-101619-0004 AND THEREFORE COMMON AND LESS SPECULATIVE SOULS ARE FOUND TO BE MORE PROPER FOR AND MORE SUCCESSFUL IN THE MANAGEMENT OF AFFAIRS AND THE ELEVATED AND EXQUISITE OPINIONS OF PHILOSOPHY UNFIT FOR BUSINESS THIS SHARP VIVACITY OF SOUL AND THE SUPPLE AND RESTLESS VOLUBILITY ATTENDING IT DISTURB OUR NEGOTIATIONS
lbi-7601-101619-0005 HE WHO DIVES INTO AND IN HIS INQUISITION COMPREHENDS ALL CIRCUMSTANCES AND CONSEQUENCES HINDERS HIS ELECTION A LITTLE ENGINE WELL HANDLED IS SUFFICIENT FOR EXECUTIONS WHETHER OF LESS OR GREATER WEIGHT
lbi-7601-101622-0000 THE ROMANS BY THIS MEANS ERECTED THEIR COLONIES FOR PERCEIVING THEIR CITY TO GROW IMMEASURABLY POPULOUS THEY EASED IT OF THE MOST UNNECESSARY PEOPLE AND SENT THEM TO INHABIT AND CULTIVATE THE LANDS CONQUERED BY THEM SOMETIMES ALSO THEY PURPOSELY MAINTAINED WARS WITH SOME OF THEIR ENEMIES NOT ONLY TO KEEP THEIR OWN MEN IN ACTION FOR FEAR LEST IDLENESS THE MOTHER OF CORRUPTION SHOULD BRING UPON THEM SOME WORSE INCONVENIENCE
lbi-7601-101622-0001 AND WE SUFFER THE ILLS OF A LONG PEACE LUXURY IS MORE PERNICIOUS THAN WAR
lbi-7601-101622-0002 AND THIS ALSO WAS ONE REASON WHY OUR KING PHILIP CONSENTED TO SEND HIS SON JOHN UPON A FOREIGN EXPEDITION THAT HE MIGHT TAKE ALONG WITH HIM A GREAT NUMBER OF HOT YOUNG MEN WHO WERE THEN IN HIS PAY
lbi-7601-101622-0003 WHAT OTHER END DOES THE IMPIOUS ART OF THE GLADIATORS PROPOSE TO ITSELF WHAT THE SLAUGHTER OF YOUNG MEN WHAT PLEASURE FED WITH BLOOD
lbi-7601-101622-0004 PRINCE TAKE THE HONOURS DELAYED FOR THY REIGN AND BE SUCCESSOR TO THY FATHERS HENCEFORTH LET NONE AT ROME BE SLAIN FOR SPORT
lbi-7601-101622-0005 LET BEASTS BLOOD STAIN THE INFAMOUS ARENA AND NO MORE HOMICIDES BE THERE ACTED
lbi-7601-101622-0006 IT WAS NOT ENOUGH FOR THEM TO FIGHT AND TO DIE BRAVELY BUT CHEERFULLY TOO INSOMUCH THAT THEY WERE HISSED AND CURSED IF THEY MADE ANY HESITATION ABOUT RECEIVING THEIR DEATH
lbi-7601-101622-0007 THE VERY GIRLS THEMSELVES SET THEM ON
lbi-7601-175351-0000 BEGINNING OF REVOLT
lbi-7601-175351-0001 AT THIS UNEXPECTED COMMAND THE SURPRISE WAS GREAT ON BOARD THE FORWARD
lbi-7601-175351-0002 LIGHT THE FIRES EXCLAIMED SOME
lbi-7601-175351-0003 WHAT WITH ASKED OTHERS
lbi-7601-175351-0004 AND STUFF THE STOVE WITH THE MASTS ADDED WARREN
lbi-7601-175351-0005 DID YOU HEAR ME
lbi-7601-175351-0006 WHO SPOKE CRIED HATTERAS
lbi-7601-175351-0007 I DID SAID PEN ADVANCING TOWARDS THE CAPTAIN
lbi-7601-175351-0008 I SAY ANSWERED PEN WITH AN OATH I SAY WE'VE HAD ENOUGH OF IT AND WE WON'T GO ANY FURTHER
lbi-7601-175351-0009 YOU SHAN'T KILL US WITH HUNGER AND WORK IN THE WINTER AND THEY SHAN'T LIGHT THE FIRES
lbi-7601-175351-0010 IF YOU REPEAT WHAT THE MAN SAYS ANSWERED HATTERAS I'LL HAVE YOU SHUT UP IN YOUR CABIN AND GUARDED
lbi-7601-175351-0011 A MURMUR WAS HEARD
lbi-7601-175351-0012 THE ENGINEER FOLLOWED BY PLOVER AND WARREN WENT DOWN TO HIS POST
lbi-7601-175351-0013 THE STEAM WAS SOON GOT UP THE ANCHORS WERE WEIGHED AND THE FORWARD VEERED AWAY EAST CUTTING THE YOUNG ICE WITH HER STEEL PROW
lbi-7601-175351-0014 BETWEEN BARING ISLAND AND BEECHER POINT THERE ARE A CONSIDERABLE QUANTITY OF ISLANDS IN THE MIDST OF ICE FIELDS THE STREAMS CROWD TOGETHER IN THE LITTLE CHANNELS WHICH CUT UP THIS PART OF THE SEA THEY HAD A TENDENCY TO AGGLOMERATE UNDER THE RELATIVELY LOW TEMPERATURE HUMMOCKS WERE FORMED HERE AND THERE AND THESE MASSES ALREADY MORE COMPACT DENSER AND CLOSER TOGETHER WOULD SOON FORM AN IMPENETRABLE MASS
lbi-7601-175351-0015 I AM BEGINNING NOT TO ANSWERED WALL
lbi-7601-175351-0016 HATTERAS STILL HOPED TO FIND AN OPEN SEA BEYOND THE SEVENTY SEVENTH PARALLEL AS SIR EDWARD BELCHER HAD DONE
lbi-7601-175351-0017 OUGHT HE TO TREAT THESE ACCOUNTS AS APOCRYPHAL
lbi-7601-175351-0018 THE NEXT DAY THE SUN SET FOR THE FIRST TIME ENDING THUS THE LONG SERIES OF DAYS WITH TWENTY FOUR HOURS IN THEM
lbi-7601-175351-0019 THE MEN HAD ENDED BY GETTING ACCUSTOMED TO THE CONTINUAL DAYLIGHT BUT IT HAD NEVER MADE ANY DIFFERENCE TO THE ANIMALS THE GREENLAND DOGS WENT TO THEIR REST AT THEIR ACCUSTOMED HOUR AND DICK SLEPT AS REGULARLY EVERY EVENING AS THOUGH DARKNESS HAD COVERED THE SKY
lbi-7601-175351-0020 THE DOCTOR BY FOLLOWING JOHNSON'S ADVICE ACCUSTOMED HIMSELF TO SUPPORT THE LOW TEMPERATURE HE ALMOST ALWAYS STAYED ON DECK BRAVING THE COLD THE WIND AND THE SNOW
lbi-7601-175351-0021 THERE'S MORE THAN ONE AMONGST US WHO WOULD LIKE TO IMITATE THEM I THINK
lbi-7601-175351-0022 THEY ARE COWARDS MISTER CLAWBONNY THOSE ANIMALS HAVE NO PROVISIONS AS WE HAVE AND ARE OBLIGED TO SEEK THEIR FOOD WHERE IT IS TO BE FOUND
lbi-7601-175351-0023 YOU HOPE THAT HATTERAS WILL SUCCEED THEN
lbi-7601-175351-0024 HE CERTAINLY WILL MISTER CLAWBONNY
lbi-7601-175351-0025 I AM OF THE SAME OPINION AS YOU JOHNSON AND IF HE ONLY WANTED ONE FAITHFUL COMPANION HE'LL HAVE TWO
lbi-7601-175351-0026 PRINCE ALBERT LAND WHICH THE FORWARD WAS THEN COASTING BEARS ALSO THE NAME OF GRINNELL LAND AND THOUGH HATTERAS FROM HIS HATRED TO THE YANKEES WOULD NEVER CALL IT BY ITS AMERICAN NAME IT IS THE ONE IT GENERALLY GOES BY
lbi-7601-175351-0027 ON THE EIGHTEENTH OF AUGUST THEY SIGHTED BRITANNIA MOUNTAIN SCARCELY VISIBLE THROUGH THE MIST AND THE FORWARD WEIGHED ANCHOR THE NEXT DAY IN NORTHUMBERLAND BAY
lbi-7601-291468-0000 WHEN THE LOFTY THUCYDIDES IS ABOUT TO ENTER UPON HIS DESCRIPTION OF THE PLAGUE THAT DESOLATED ATHENS ONE OF HIS MODERN COMMENTATORS ASSURES THE READER THAT THE HISTORY IS NOW GOING TO BE EXCEEDINGLY SOLEMN SERIOUS AND PATHETIC AND HINTS WITH THAT AIR OF CHUCKLING GRATULATION WITH WHICH A GOOD DAME DRAWS FORTH A CHOICE MORSEL FROM A CUPBOARD TO REGALE A FAVORITE THAT THIS PLAGUE WILL GIVE HIS HISTORY A MOST AGREEABLE VARIETY
lbi-7601-291468-0001 SUCH ARE THE TRUE SUBJECTS FOR THE HISTORIC PEN
lbi-7601-291468-0002 THE FALL OF EMPIRES THE DESOLATION OF HAPPY COUNTRIES SPLENDID CITIES SMOKING IN THEIR RUINS THE PROUDEST WORKS OF ART TUMBLED IN THE DUST THE SHRIEKS AND GROANS OF WHOLE NATIONS ASCENDING UNTO HEAVEN
lbi-7601-291468-0003 THUS THOSE SWARMS OF FLIES WHICH ARE SO OFTEN EXECRATED AS USELESS VERMIN ARE CREATED FOR THE SUSTENANCE OF SPIDERS AND SPIDERS ON THE OTHER HAND ARE EVIDENTLY MADE TO DEVOUR FLIES
lbi-7601-291468-0004 ANCIENT TRADITIONS SPEAK MUCH OF HIS LEARNING AND OF THE GALLANT INROADS HE HAD MADE INTO THE DEAD LANGUAGES IN WHICH HE HAD MADE CAPTIVE A HOST OF GREEK NOUNS AND LATIN VERBS AND BROUGHT OFF RICH BOOTY IN ANCIENT SAWS AND APOPHTHEGMS WHICH HE WAS WONT TO PARADE IN HIS PUBLIC HARANGUES AS A TRIUMPHANT GENERAL OF YORE HIS SPOLIA OPIMA
lbi-7601-291468-0005 IT WAS OBSERVED HOWEVER THAT HE SELDOM GOT INTO AN ARGUMENT WITHOUT GETTING INTO A PERPLEXITY AND THEN INTO A PASSION WITH HIS ADVERSARY FOR NOT BEING CONVINCED GRATIS
lbi-7601-291468-0006 HIS ABODE WHICH HE HAD FIXED AT A BOWERY OR COUNTRY SEAT AT A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE CITY JUST AT WHAT IS NOW CALLED DUTCH STREET SOON ABOUNDED WITH PROOFS OF HIS INGENUITY PATENT SMOKE JACKS THAT REQUIRED A HORSE TO WORK THEM DUTCH OVENS THAT ROASTED MEAT WITHOUT FIRE CARTS THAT WENT BEFORE THE HORSES WEATHERCOCKS THAT TURNED AGAINST THE WIND AND OTHER WRONG HEADED CONTRIVANCES THAT ASTONISHED AND CONFOUNDED ALL BEHOLDERS
lbi-7601-291468-0007 IT IS IN KNOWLEDGE AS IN SWIMMING HE WHO FLOUNDERS AND SPLASHES ON THE SURFACE MAKES MORE NOISE AND ATTRACTS MORE ATTENTION THAN THE PEARL DIVER WHO QUIETLY DIVES IN QUEST OF TREASURES TO THE BOTTOM
lbi-7641-96252-0000 THUS WHEN DOGMAS LEAD IT WHAT THE MAN REALLY AND IN GENERAL WILLS REMAINS STILL THE SAME
lbi-7641-96252-0001 FOR THESE ARE CAREFUL ONLY FOR THEMSELVES FOR THEIR OWN EGOISM JUST LIKE THE BANDIT FROM WHOM THEY ARE ONLY DISTINGUISHED BY THE ABSURDITY OF THEIR MEANS
lbi-7641-96252-0002 THE DEEDS AND CONDUCT OF AN INDIVIDUAL AND OF A NATION MAY BE VERY MUCH MODIFIED THROUGH DOGMAS EXAMPLE AND CUSTOM
lbi-7641-96252-0003 WITH AN EQUAL DEGREE OF WICKEDNESS ONE MAN MAY DIE ON THE WHEEL AND ANOTHER IN THE BOSOM OF HIS FAMILY
lbi-7641-96252-0004 IT IS CONCEIVABLE THAT A PERFECT STATE OR PERHAPS INDEED A COMPLETE AND FIRMLY BELIEVED DOCTRINE OF REWARDS AND PUNISHMENTS AFTER DEATH MIGHT PREVENT EVERY CRIME POLITICALLY MUCH WOULD BE GAINED THEREBY MORALLY NOTHING ONLY THE EXPRESSION OF THE WILL IN LIFE WOULD BE RESTRICTED
lbi-7641-96252-0005 WE WHO HERE SEEK THE THEORY OF VIRTUE AND HAVE THEREFORE ALSO TO EXPRESS ABSTRACTLY THE NATURE OF THE KNOWLEDGE WHICH LIES AT ITS FOUNDATION WILL YET BE UNABLE TO CONVEY THAT KNOWLEDGE ITSELF IN THIS EXPRESSION
lbi-7641-96252-0006 HE SEES THAT THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN HIMSELF AND OTHERS WHICH TO THE BAD MAN IS SO GREAT A GULF ONLY BELONGS TO A FLEETING AND ILLUSIVE PHENOMENON
lbi-7641-96252-0007 HE RECOGNISES HIMSELF HIS WILL IN EVERY BEING AND CONSEQUENTLY ALSO IN THE SUFFERER
lbi-7641-96252-0008 BUT THE LATTER IS THE NECESSARY AND INEVITABLE SYMPTOM OF THAT KNOWLEDGE
lbi-7641-96252-0009 THE OPPOSITE OF THE STING OF CONSCIENCE THE ORIGIN AND SIGNIFICANCE OF WHICH IS EXPLAINED ABOVE IS THE GOOD CONSCIENCE THE SATISFACTION WHICH WE EXPERIENCE AFTER EVERY DISINTERESTED DEED
lbi-7641-96252-0010 THE GOOD MAN LIVES IN A WORLD OF FRIENDLY INDIVIDUALS THE WELL BEING OF ANY OF WHOM HE REGARDS AS HIS OWN
lbi-7641-96252-0011 THEREFORE ALTHOUGH THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE LOT OF MANKIND GENERALLY DOES NOT MAKE HIS DISPOSITION A JOYFUL ONE YET THE PERMANENT KNOWLEDGE OF HIS OWN NATURE IN ALL LIVING BEINGS GIVES HIM A CERTAIN EVENNESS AND EVEN SERENITY OF DISPOSITION
lbi-7641-96252-0012 FOR THE INTEREST WHICH IS EXTENDED TO INNUMERABLE MANIFESTATIONS CANNOT CAUSE SUCH ANXIETY AS THAT WHICH IS CONCENTRATED UPON ONE
lbi-7641-96252-0013 THE ACCIDENTS WHICH CONCERN INDIVIDUALS COLLECTIVELY EQUALISE THEMSELVES WHILE THOSE WHICH HAPPEN TO THE PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL CONSTITUTE GOOD OR BAD FORTUNE
lbi-7641-96252-0014 THUS THOUGH OTHERS HAVE SET UP MORAL PRINCIPLES WHICH THEY GIVE OUT AS PRESCRIPTIONS FOR VIRTUE AND LAWS WHICH IT WAS NECESSARY TO FOLLOW I AS HAS ALREADY BEEN SAID CANNOT DO THIS BECAUSE I HAVE NO OUGHT OR LAW TO PRESCRIBE TO THE ETERNALLY FREE WILL
lbi-7641-96252-0015 FURTHER THAN THIS IT CANNOT GO FOR THERE EXISTS NO REASON FOR PREFERRING THE INDIVIDUALITY OF ANOTHER TO ITS OWN
lbi-7641-96252-0016 YET THE NUMBER OF OTHER INDIVIDUALS WHOSE WHOLE HAPPINESS OR LIFE IS IN DANGER MAY OUTWEIGH THE REGARD FOR ONE'S OWN PARTICULAR WELL BEING
lbi-7641-96252-0017 SO DIED SOCRATES AND GIORDANO BRUNO AND SO MANY A HERO OF THE TRUTH SUFFERED DEATH AT THE STAKE AT THE HANDS OF THE PRIESTS
lbi-7641-96252-0018 WEEPING IS ACCORDINGLY SYMPATHY WITH OUR OWN SELVES OR SYMPATHY DIRECTED BACK ON ITS SOURCE
lbi-7641-96252-0019 IT IS THEREFORE CONDITIONAL UPON THE CAPACITY FOR LOVE AND SYMPATHY AND ALSO UPON IMAGINATION
lbi-7641-96252-0020 WHEN WE ARE MOVED TO TEARS NOT THROUGH OUR OWN SUFFERING BUT THROUGH THAT OF ANOTHER THIS HAPPENS AS FOLLOWS
lbi-7641-96252-0021 EITHER WE VIVIDLY PUT OURSELVES IN THE PLACE OF THE SUFFERER BY IMAGINATION OR SEE IN HIS FATE THE LOT OF HUMANITY AS A WHOLE AND CONSEQUENTLY FIRST OF ALL OUR OWN LOT AND THUS IN A VERY ROUNDABOUT WAY IT IS YET ALWAYS ABOUT OURSELVES THAT WE WEEP SYMPATHY WITH OURSELVES WHICH WE FEEL THIS SEEMS TO BE THE PRINCIPAL REASON OF THE UNIVERSAL AND THUS NATURAL WEEPING IN THE CASE OF DEATH
lbi-7641-96252-0022 FIRST OF ALL HE CERTAINLY WEEPS FOR THE FATE OF THE DEAD BUT HE ALSO WEEPS WHEN AFTER LONG HEAVY AND INCURABLE SUFFERING DEATH WAS TO THIS MAN A WISHED FOR DELIVERANCE
lbi-7641-96670-0000 THEY WERE IN THE LAND THIS PEOPLE SAID BEFORE THE MOON HAD COME INTO THE SKY
lbi-7641-96670-0001 AND MANY OF THE MAGICIANS OF EGYPT WHO HAD COME WITH KING SESOSTRIS STAYED IN THAT CITY OF AEA AND THEY TAUGHT PEOPLE SPELLS THAT COULD STAY THE MOON IN HER GOING AND COMING IN HER RISING AND SETTING
lbi-7641-96670-0002 MEDEA TOO HIS WISE DAUGHTER KNEW THE SECRETS TAUGHT BY THOSE WHO COULD SWAY THE MOON
lbi-7641-96670-0003 FOR JASON WAS THE GRANDSON OF CRETHEUS AND CRETHEUS WAS THE BROTHER OF ATHAMAS THEIR GRANDFATHER
lbi-7641-96670-0004 JASON TOOK PELEUS AND TELAMON WITH HIM
lbi-7641-96670-0005 AS THEY CAME TO THE CITY A MIST FELL AND JASON AND HIS COMRADES WITH THE SONS OF PHRIXUS WENT THROUGH THE CITY WITHOUT BEING SEEN
lbi-7641-96670-0006 THE MIST LIFTED AND BEFORE THE HEROES WAS THE WONDER OF THE PALACE IN THE BRIGHT LIGHT OF THE MORNING
lbi-7641-96670-0007 ON EACH SIDE OF THE COURTYARD WERE THE PALACE BUILDINGS IN ONE KING A EETES LIVED WITH APSYRTUS HIS SON AND IN THE OTHER CHALCIOPE AND MEDEA LIVED WITH THEIR HANDMAIDENS
lbi-7641-96670-0008 AND THEN A DOVE FLEW TOWARD HER IT WAS BEING CHASED BY A HAWK AND MEDEA SAW THE HAWK'S EYES AND BEAK
lbi-7641-96670-0009 WE PULLED AWAY FROM THAT PLACE AND THEREAFTER WE WERE DRIVEN BY THE WINDS BACK TO THE MOUTH OF THE PHASIS
lbi-7641-96670-0010 WITH HIM THERE CAME THE MIGHTIEST OF THE HEROES OF GREECE
lbi-7641-96670-0011 ALREADY HE HAS HEARD OF YOUR BITTER FOES THE SAUROMATAE
lbi-7641-96670-0012 HE WITH HIS COMRADES WOULD SUBDUE THEM FOR YOU
lbi-7641-96670-0013 A EETES'S HEART WAS FILLED WITH WRATH AS HE LOOKED UPON THEM AND HIS EYES SHONE AS A LEOPARD'S EYES
lbi-7641-96670-0014 AND THEN SPEAKING TO THE KING IN A QUIET VOICE JASON SAID
lbi-7641-96670-0015 HIS HEART WAS DIVIDED AS TO WHETHER HE SHOULD SUMMON HIS ARMED MEN AND HAVE THEM SLAIN UPON THE SPOT OR WHETHER HE SHOULD PUT THEM INTO DANGER BY THE TRIAL HE WOULD MAKE OF THEM
lbi-7641-96670-0016 IT MAY BE THAT YE ARE TRULY OF THE SEED OF THE IMMORTALS
lbi-7641-96670-0017 AND IT MAY BE THAT I SHALL GIVE YOU THE GOLDEN FLEECE TO BEAR AWAY AFTER I HAVE MADE TRIAL OF YOU
lbi-7641-96670-0018 SHE ENTERED SOFTLY AND SHE STOOD AWAY FROM HER FATHER AND THE FOUR WHO WERE SPEAKING WITH HIM
lbi-7641-96670-0019 SHE HAD A DARK FACE THAT WAS MADE VERY STRANGE BY HER CROWN OF GOLDEN HAIR
lbi-7641-96670-0020 KNOW THAT ON THE PLAIN OF ARES YONDER I HAVE TWO FIRE BREATHING BULLS WITH FEET OF BRASS
lbi-7641-96670-0021 THEN I SOWED THE FURROWS NOT WITH THE SEED THAT DEMETER GIVES BUT WITH TEETH OF A DRAGON
lbi-7641-96670-0022 IF YOU CAN ACCOMPLISH THIS THAT I ACCOMPLISHED IN DAYS GONE BY I SHALL SUBMIT TO YOU AND GIVE YOU THE GOLDEN FLEECE
lbi-7641-96670-0023 BUT IF YOU CANNOT ACCOMPLISH WHAT I ONCE ACCOMPLISHED YOU SHALL GO FROM MY CITY EMPTY HANDED FOR IT IS NOT RIGHT THAT A BRAVE MAN SHOULD YIELD AUGHT TO ONE WHO CANNOT SHOW HIMSELF AS BRAVE
lbi-7641-96670-0024 THEN JASON UTTERLY CONFOUNDED CAST HIS EYES UPON THE GROUND
lbi-7641-96670-0025 I WILL DARE THIS CONTEST MONSTROUS AS IT IS
lbi-7641-96670-0026 AS HE SAID THIS HE SAW THE EYES OF MEDEA GROW WIDE AS WITH FEAR
lbi-7641-96670-0027 PHRONTIS AND MELAS WENT TO WHERE THEIR MOTHER WAS
lbi-7641-96684-0000 AND AS A MORTAL APOLLO SOUGHT TO EARN HIS BREAD AMONGST MEN
lbi-7641-96684-0001 AFTERWARD PEOPLE WONDERED AT ADMETUS'S EVER SMILING FACE AND EVER RADIANT BEING
lbi-7641-96684-0002 THAT WAS BEFORE ADMETUS SAILED ON THE ARGO WITH JASON AND THE COMPANIONS OF THE QUEST
lbi-7641-96684-0003 THEREAFTER ADMETUS HAVING THE LOVE OF ALCESTIS WAS EVEN MORE HAPPY THAN HE HAD BEEN BEFORE
lbi-7641-96684-0004 A RADIANT FIGURE IT WAS AND ADMETUS KNEW THAT THIS WAS APOLLO COME TO HIM AGAIN
lbi-7641-96684-0005 BUT APOLLO TURNED TO ADMETUS A FACE THAT WAS WITHOUT JOY
lbi-7641-96684-0006 WHAT YEARS OF HAPPINESS HAVE BEEN MINE O APOLLO THROUGH YOUR FRIENDSHIP FOR ME SAID ADMETUS
lbi-7641-96684-0007 BUT STILL APOLLO STOOD BEFORE HIM WITH A FACE THAT WAS WITHOUT JOY
lbi-7641-96684-0008 HE SPOKE AND HIS VOICE WAS NOT THAT CLEAR AND VIBRANT VOICE THAT HE HAD ONCE IN SPEAKING TO ADMETUS
lbi-7641-96684-0009 ADMETUS ADMETUS HE SAID IT IS FOR ME TO TELL YOU THAT YOU MAY NO MORE LOOK ON THE BLUE SKY NOR WALK UPON THE GREEN EARTH
lbi-7641-96684-0010 IT IS FOR ME TO TELL YOU THAT THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD WILL HAVE YOU COME TO HIM ADMETUS ADMETUS KNOW THAT EVEN NOW THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD IS SENDING DEATH FOR YOU
lbi-7641-96684-0011 IF ONE WILL GO WILLINGLY IN THY PLACE WITH DEATH THOU CANST STILL LIVE ON GO ADMETUS
lbi-7641-96684-0012 AND THEN HE CAME UPON AN ANCIENT WOMAN WHO SAT UPON STONES IN THE COURTYARD GRINDING CORN BETWEEN TWO STONES
lbi-7641-96684-0013 THERE SHE WAS SITTING AS HE HAD FIRST KNOWN HER WITH HER EYES BLEARED AND HER KNEES SHAKING AND WITH THE DUST OF THE COURTYARD AND THE HUSKS OF THE CORN IN HER MATTED HAIR
lbi-7641-96684-0014 HE WENT TO HER AND SPOKE TO HER AND HE ASKED HER TO TAKE THE PLACE OF THE KING AND GO WITH DEATH
lbi-7641-96684-0015 BUT WHEN SHE HEARD THE NAME OF DEATH HORROR CAME INTO THE FACE OF THE ANCIENT WOMAN AND SHE CRIED OUT THAT SHE WOULD NOT LET DEATH COME NEAR HER
lbi-7641-96684-0016 ADMETUS TOOK THE MAN'S SHRIVELED HAND AND HE ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD NOT TAKE THE KING'S PLACE AND GO WITH DEATH THAT WAS COMING FOR HIM
lbi-7641-96684-0017 THEN ADMETUS WENT INTO THE PALACE AND INTO THE CHAMBER WHERE HIS BED WAS AND HE LAY DOWN UPON THE BED AND HE LAMENTED THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO GO WITH DEATH THAT WAS COMING FOR HIM FROM THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD AND HE LAMENTED THAT NONE OF THE WRETCHED ONES AROUND THE PALACE WOULD TAKE HIS PLACE
lbi-7641-96684-0018 ONE SHOULD GO IN YOUR PLACE FOR YOU ARE THE KING AND HAVE MANY GREAT AFFAIRS TO ATTEND TO
lbi-7641-96684-0019 NOW THE FOOTSTEPS SEEMED TO STOP
lbi-7641-96684-0020 IT WAS NOT SO TERRIBLE FOR HIM AS BEFORE
lbi-7641-96684-0021 AND THE WORDS HE HAD SPOKEN HE WOULD HAVE TAKEN BACK THE WORDS THAT HAD BROUGHT HER CONSENT TO GO WITH DEATH IN HIS PLACE
lbi-7641-96684-0022 DEATH WOULD SOON BE HERE FOR HER
lbi-7641-96684-0023 NO NOT HERE FOR HE WOULD NOT HAVE DEATH COME INTO THE PALACE
lbi-7641-96684-0024 HE LIFTED ALCESTIS FROM THE BED AND HE CARRIED HER FROM THE PALACE
lbi-7641-96684-0025 NO MORE SPEECH CAME FROM HER
lbi-7641-96684-0026 AND AS FOR ADMETUS HE WENT WITHIN THE CHAMBER AND KNELT BESIDE THE BED ON WHICH ALCESTIS HAD LAIN AND THOUGHT OF HIS TERRIBLE LOSS
lbi-7641-96684-0027 TO WHAT GOD IS THAT SACRIFICE DUE
lbi-7641-96684-0028 AND THEN HERACLES FELT THAT ANOTHER LABOR WAS BEFORE HIM
lbi-7641-96684-0029 I HAVE DRAGGED UP FROM THE UNDERWORLD HE THOUGHT THE HOUND THAT GUARDS THOSE WHOM DEATH BRINGS DOWN INTO THE REALM OF THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD
lbi-7641-96684-0030 WHY SHOULD I NOT STRIVE WITH DEATH
lbi-7641-96684-0031 AND WHAT A NOBLE THING IT WOULD BE TO BRING BACK THIS FAITHFUL WOMAN TO HER HOUSE AND TO HER HUSBAND
lbi-7641-96684-0032 HE LEFT THE PALACE OF ADMETUS AND HE WENT TO THE TEMPLE OF THE GODS
lbi-7641-96684-0033 YOU ARE HELD BY ME DEATH AND YOU WILL NOT BE LET GO UNLESS YOU PROMISE TO GO FORTH FROM THIS TEMPLE WITHOUT BRINGING ONE WITH YOU
lbi-7641-96684-0034 AND DEATH KNOWING THAT HERACLES COULD HOLD HIM THERE AND THAT THE BUSINESS OF THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD WOULD BE LEFT UNDONE IF HE WERE HELD PROMISED THAT HE WOULD LEAVE THE TEMPLE WITHOUT BRINGING ONE WITH HIM
lbi-7641-96684-0035 SHE WAS VEILED AND ADMETUS COULD NOT SEE HER FEATURES
lbi-7641-96684-0036 HERE IS A WOMAN WHOM I AM BRINGING BACK TO HER HUSBAND I WON HER FROM AN ENEMY
lbi-7641-96684-0037 THIS I CANNOT DO SAID ADMETUS I HAVE HAD PANGS ENOUGH
lbi-7641-96684-0038 THEN ADMETUS RAISED THE VEIL OF THE WOMAN HE HAD TAKEN ACROSS THE THRESHOLD OF HIS HOUSE
lbi-7697-105815-0000 HE NOW WENT ON TILL HE CAME TO THE HOUSE AT THE DOOR OF WHICH HE WAS TO KNOCK THIS HE DID TWO OR THREE TIMES
lbi-7697-105815-0001 CHRISTIAN I HAVE COME TO SEE THE GOOD MAN OF THE HOUSE
lbi-7697-105815-0002 CHRISTIAN SIR I AM COME FROM THE CITY OF DESTRUCTION AND AM ON MY WAY TO MOUNT ZION
lbi-7697-105815-0003 I WAS TOLD BY THE MAN THAT STANDS AT THE GATE THAT IF I CAME HERE YOU WOULD SHOW ME GOOD THINGS THAT WOULD HELP ME
lbi-7697-105815-0004 HE STOOD AS IF HE WOULD PLEAD FOR MEN AND A CROWN OF GOLD HUNG NEAR HIS HEAD
lbi-7697-105815-0005 CHRISTIAN WHAT DOES THIS MEAN
lbi-7697-105815-0006 THEN HE TOOK HIM TO A LARGE ROOM THAT WAS FULL OF DUST FOR IT HAD NOT BEEN SWEPT AND INTERPRETER TOLD HIS MAN TO SWEEP IT
lbi-7697-105815-0007 CHRISTIAN WHAT MEANS THIS
lbi-7697-105815-0008 THEN YOU NEXT SAW THE MAID COME IN TO LAY THE DUST SO IS SIN MADE CLEAN AND LAID LOW BY FAITH IN THE BOOK
lbi-7697-105815-0009 JUST AS CHRISTIAN CAME UP TO THE CROSS HIS LOAD SLID FROM HIS BACK CLOSE TO THE MOUTH OF THE TOMB WHERE IT FELL IN AND I SAW IT NO MORE
lbi-7697-105815-0010 AS HE STOOD THUS AND WEPT LO THREE BRIGHT ONES CAME TO HIM AND ONE OF THEM SAID PEACE BE TO THEE THOU HAST GRACE FROM THY SINS
lbi-7697-105815-0011 CHRISTIAN GAVE THREE LEAPS FOR JOY AND SANG AS HE WENT AH WHAT A PLACE IS THIS BLEST CROSS BLEST TOMB
lbi-7697-105815-0012 HE WENT ON THUS TILL HE CAME TO A VALE WHERE HE SAW THREE MEN WHO WERE IN A SOUND SLEEP WITH CHAINS ON THEIR FEET
lbi-7697-105815-0013 CHRISTIAN SIRS WHENCE COME YOU AND WHERE DO YOU GO
lbi-7697-105815-0014 FORMALIST AND HYPOCRISY WE WERE BORN IN THE LAND OF VAIN GLORY AND ARE ON OUR WAY TO MOUNT ZION FOR PRAISE
lbi-7697-105815-0015 KNOW YOU NOT THAT HE THAT COMES NOT IN AT THE DOOR BUT CLIMBS UP TO GET IN THE SAME IS A THIEF
lbi-7697-105815-0016 THEY TOLD CHRISTIAN THAT HE HAD NO NEED FOR CARE ON THAT SCORE FOR LONG USE HAD MADE IT LAW AND THEY COULD PROVE THAT IT HAD BEEN SO FOR YEARS
lbi-7697-105815-0017 YES SAID THEY NO DOUBT OF IT
lbi-7697-105815-0018 AND IF WE GET IN THE ROAD AT ALL PRAY WHAT ARE THE ODDS
lbi-7697-105815-0019 IS NOT OUR CASE AS GOOD AS YOURS
lbi-7697-105815-0020 I SAW THEN THAT THEY ALL WENT ON TILL THEY CAME TO THE FOOT OF THE HILL OF DIFFICULTY WHERE THERE WAS A SPRING
lbi-7697-105815-0021 NOW WHEN CHRISTIAN GOT AS FAR AS THE SPRING OF LIFE HE DRANK OF IT AND THEN WENT UP THE HILL
lbi-7697-105815-0022 NOW HALF WAY UP WAS A CAVE MADE BY THE LORD OF THAT HILL THAT THOSE WHO CAME BY MIGHT REST THERE
lbi-7697-105815-0023 TIMOROUS SAID THAT ZION WAS THE HILL THEY MEANT TO CLIMB BUT THAT WHEN THEY HAD GOT HALF WAY THEY FOUND THAT THEY MET WITH MORE AND MORE RISK SO THAT GREAT FEAR CAME ON THEM AND ALL THEY COULD DO WAS TO TURN BACK
lbi-7697-105815-0024 YES SAID MISTRUST FOR JUST IN FRONT OF US THERE LAY TWO BEASTS OF PREY IN OUR PATH WE KNEW NOT IF THEY SLEPT OR NOT BUT WE THOUGHT THAT THEY WOULD FALL ON US AND TEAR OUR LIMBS
lbi-7697-105815-0025 YET HE THOUGHT ONCE MORE OF WHAT HE HAD HEARD FROM THE MEN AND THEN HE FELT IN HIS CLOAK FOR HIS SCROLL THAT HE MIGHT READ IT AND FIND SOME PEACE
lbi-7697-105815-0026 HE FELT FOR IT BUT FOUND IT NOT
lbi-7697-105815-0027 SO HE FELL DOWN ON HIS KNEES TO PRAY THAT GOD WOULD GIVE HIM GRACE FOR THIS ACT AND THEN WENT BACK TO LOOK FOR HIS SCROLL
lbi-7697-105815-0028 OH FOOL THAT I AM SAID HE TO SLEEP IN THE DAY TIME SO TO GIVE WAY TO THE FLESH AS TO USE FOR EASE THAT REST WHICH THE LORD OF THE HILL HAD MADE BUT FOR THE HELP OF THE SOUL
lbi-7697-105815-0029 SUCH WAS THE LOT OF THE JEWS FOR THEIR SIN THEY WERE SENT BACK BY THE WAY OF THE RED SEA AND I AM MADE TO TREAD THOSE STEPS WITH GRIEF WHICH I MIGHT HAVE TROD WITH JOY HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THIS SLEEP
lbi-7697-105815-0030 HOW FAR MIGHT I HAVE BEEN ON MY WAY BY THIS TIME
lbi-7697-105815-0031 NOW BY THIS TIME HE HAD COME TO THE VALE ONCE MORE WHERE FOR A SPELL HE SAT DOWN AND WEPT BUT AT LAST AS HE CAST A SAD GLANCE AT THE FOOT OF THE BENCH HE SAW HIS SCROLL WHICH HE CAUGHT UP WITH HASTE AND PUT IN HIS CLOAK
lbi-7697-105815-0032 WORDS ARE TOO WEAK TO TELL THE JOY OF CHRISTIAN WHEN HE HAD GOT BACK HIS SCROLL
lbi-7697-105815-0033 HE LAID IT UP IN THE BREAST OF HIS COAT AND GAVE THANKS TO GOD
lbi-7697-105815-0034 WITH WHAT A LIGHT STEP DID HE NOW CLIMB THE HILL
lbi-7697-105815-0035 AH THOUGHT HE THESE BEASTS RANGE IN THE NIGHT FOR THEIR PREY AND IF THEY SHOULD MEET WITH ME IN THE DARK HOW SHOULD I FLY FROM THEM
lbi-7697-105815-0036 THE NAME OF THE MAN WHO KEPT THE LODGE OF THAT HOUSE WAS WATCHFUL AND WHEN HE SAW THAT CHRISTIAN MADE A HALT AS IF HE WOULD GO BACK HE CAME OUT TO HIM AND SAID IS THY STRENGTH SO SMALL
lbi-7697-105815-0037 FEAR NOT THE TWO WILD BEASTS FOR THEY ARE BOUND BY CHAINS AND ARE PUT HERE TO TRY THE FAITH OF THOSE THAT HAVE IT AND TO FIND OUT THOSE THAT HAVE NONE
lbi-7697-105815-0038 KEEP IN THE MIDST OF THE PATH AND NO HARM SHALL COME TO THEE
lbi-7697-105815-0039 THEN I SAW IN MY DREAM THAT STILL HE WENT ON IN GREAT DREAD OF THE WILD BEASTS HE HEARD THEM ROAR YET THEY DID HIM NO HARM BUT WHEN HE HAD GONE BY THEM HE WENT ON WITH JOY TILL HE CAME AND STOOD IN FRONT OF THE LODGE WHERE WATCHFUL DWELT
lbi-7697-105815-0040 CHRISTIAN SIR WHAT HOUSE IS THIS MAY I REST HERE TO NIGHT
lbi-7697-105815-0041 WHEN WATCHFUL TOLD HER WHY CHRISTIAN HAD COME THERE SHE SAID WHAT IS YOUR NAME
lbi-7697-105815-0042 THEN CHRISTIAN BENT DOWN HIS HEAD AND WENT WITH THEM TO THE HOUSE
lbi-7697-105815-0043 PIETY COME GOOD CHRISTIAN SINCE OUR LOVE PROMPTS US TO TAKE YOU IN TO REST LET US TALK WITH YOU OF ALL THAT YOU HAVE SEEN ON YOUR WAY
lbi-7697-105815-0044 CHRISTIAN WITH A RIGHT GOOD WILL AND I AM GLAD THAT YOU SHOULD ASK IT OF ME
lbi-7697-105815-0045 PRUDENCE AND FIRST SAY WHAT IS IT THAT MAKES YOU WISH SO MUCH TO GO TO MOUNT ZION
lbi-7697-105815-0046 THERE THEY SAY IS NO DEATH AND THERE I SHALL DWELL WITH SUCH AS LOVE THE LORD
lbi-7697-105815-0047 CHARITY HAVE YOU A WIFE AND BABES CHRISTIAN YES I HAVE
lbi-7697-105815-0048 CHARITY AND WHY DID YOU NOT BRING THEM WITH YOU
lbi-7697-105815-0049 BUT THEY WOULD NOT COME WITH ME NOR HAVE ME LEAVE THEM
lbi-7697-105815-0050 THUS DID CHRISTIAN TALK WITH THESE FRIENDS TILL IT GREW DARK AND THEN HE TOOK HIS REST IN A LARGE ROOM THE NAME OF WHICH WAS PEACE THERE HE SLEPT TILL BREAK OF DAY AND THEN HE SANG A HYMN
lbi-7697-105815-0051 AND THEY BROUGHT OUT THE JAW BONE OF AN ASS WITH WHICH SAMSON DID SUCH GREAT FEATS AND THE SLING AND STONE WITH WHICH DAVID SLEW GOLIATH OF GATH
lbi-7697-105815-0052 WHAT IS THE NAME OF THIS LAND SAID CHRISTIAN
lbi-7697-105815-0053 THEN THEY TOLD HIM IT WAS IMMANUEL'S LAND
