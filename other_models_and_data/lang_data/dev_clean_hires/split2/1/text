lbi-1272-128104-0000 MISTER QUILTER IS THE APOSTLE OF THE MIDDLE CLASSES AND WE ARE GLAD TO WELCOME HIS GOSPEL
lbi-1272-128104-0001 NOR IS MISTER QUILTER'S MANNER LESS INTERESTING THAN HIS MATTER
lbi-1272-128104-0002 HE TELLS US THAT AT THIS FESTIVE SEASON OF THE YEAR WITH CHRISTMAS AND ROAST BEEF LOOMING BEFORE US SIMILES DRAWN FROM EATING AND ITS RESULTS OCCUR MOST READILY TO THE MIND
lbi-1272-128104-0003 HE HAS GRAVE DOUBTS WHETHER SIR FREDERICK LEIGHTON'S WORK IS REALLY GREEK AFTER ALL AND CAN DISCOVER IN IT BUT LITTLE OF ROCKY ITHACA
lbi-1272-128104-0004 LINNELL'S PICTURES ARE A SORT OF UP GUARDS AND AT EM PAINTINGS AND MASON'S EXQUISITE IDYLLS ARE AS NATIONAL AS A JINGO POEM MISTER BIRKET FOSTER'S LANDSCAPES SMILE AT ONE MUCH IN THE SAME WAY THAT MISTER CARKER USED TO FLASH HIS TEETH AND MISTER JOHN COLLIER GIVES HIS SITTER A CHEERFUL SLAP ON THE BACK BEFORE HE SAYS LIKE A SHAMPOOER IN A TURKISH BATH NEXT MAN
lbi-1272-128104-0005 IT IS OBVIOUSLY UNNECESSARY FOR US TO POINT OUT HOW LUMINOUS THESE CRITICISMS ARE HOW DELICATE IN EXPRESSION
lbi-1272-128104-0006 ON THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF ART MISTER QUILTER WRITES WITH EQUAL LUCIDITY
lbi-1272-128104-0007 PAINTING HE TELLS US IS OF A DIFFERENT QUALITY TO MATHEMATICS AND FINISH IN ART IS ADDING MORE FACT
lbi-1272-128104-0008 AS FOR ETCHINGS THEY ARE OF TWO KINDS BRITISH AND FOREIGN
lbi-1272-128104-0009 HE LAMENTS MOST BITTERLY THE DIVORCE THAT HAS BEEN MADE BETWEEN DECORATIVE ART AND WHAT WE USUALLY CALL PICTURES MAKES THE CUSTOMARY APPEAL TO THE LAST JUDGMENT AND REMINDS US THAT IN THE GREAT DAYS OF ART MICHAEL ANGELO WAS THE FURNISHING UPHOLSTERER
lbi-1272-128104-0010 NEAR THE FIRE AND THE ORNAMENTS FRED BROUGHT HOME FROM INDIA ON THE MANTEL BOARD
lbi-1272-128104-0011 IN FACT HE IS QUITE SEVERE ON MISTER RUSKIN FOR NOT RECOGNISING THAT A PICTURE SHOULD DENOTE THE FRAILTY OF MAN AND REMARKS WITH PLEASING COURTESY AND FELICITOUS GRACE THAT MANY PHASES OF FEELING
lbi-1272-128104-0012 ONLY UNFORTUNATELY HIS OWN WORK NEVER DOES GET GOOD
lbi-1272-128104-0013 MISTER QUILTER HAS MISSED HIS CHANCE FOR HE HAS FAILED EVEN TO MAKE HIMSELF THE TUPPER OF PAINTING
lbi-1272-128104-0014 BY HARRY QUILTER M A
lbi-1272-135031-0000 BECAUSE YOU WERE SLEEPING INSTEAD OF CONQUERING THE LOVELY ROSE PRINCESS HAS BECOME A FIDDLE WITHOUT A BOW WHILE POOR SHAGGY SITS THERE A COOING DOVE
lbi-1272-135031-0001 HE HAS GONE AND GONE FOR GOOD ANSWERED POLYCHROME WHO HAD MANAGED TO SQUEEZE INTO THE ROOM BESIDE THE DRAGON AND HAD WITNESSED THE OCCURRENCES WITH MUCH INTEREST
lbi-1272-135031-0002 I HAVE REMAINED A PRISONER ONLY BECAUSE I WISHED TO BE ONE AND WITH THIS HE STEPPED FORWARD AND BURST THE STOUT CHAINS AS EASILY AS IF THEY HAD BEEN THREADS
lbi-1272-135031-0003 THE LITTLE GIRL HAD BEEN ASLEEP BUT SHE HEARD THE RAPS AND OPENED THE DOOR
lbi-1272-135031-0004 THE KING HAS FLED IN DISGRACE AND YOUR FRIENDS ARE ASKING FOR YOU
lbi-1272-135031-0005 I BEGGED RUGGEDO LONG AGO TO SEND HIM AWAY BUT HE WOULD NOT DO SO
lbi-1272-135031-0006 I ALSO OFFERED TO HELP YOUR BROTHER TO ESCAPE BUT HE WOULD NOT GO
lbi-1272-135031-0007 HE EATS AND SLEEPS VERY STEADILY REPLIED THE NEW KING
lbi-1272-135031-0008 I HOPE HE DOESN'T WORK TOO HARD SAID SHAGGY
lbi-1272-135031-0009 HE DOESN'T WORK AT ALL
lbi-1272-135031-0010 IN FACT THERE IS NOTHING HE CAN DO IN THESE DOMINIONS AS WELL AS OUR NOMES WHOSE NUMBERS ARE SO GREAT THAT IT WORRIES US TO KEEP THEM ALL BUSY
lbi-1272-135031-0011 NOT EXACTLY RETURNED KALIKO
lbi-1272-135031-0012 WHERE IS MY BROTHER NOW
lbi-1272-135031-0013 INQUIRED SHAGGY IN THE METAL FOREST
lbi-1272-135031-0014 WHERE IS THAT
lbi-1272-135031-0015 THE METAL FOREST IS IN THE GREAT DOMED CAVERN THE LARGEST IN ALL OUR DOMINIONS REPLIED KALIKO
lbi-1272-135031-0016 KALIKO HESITATED
lbi-1272-135031-0017 HOWEVER IF WE LOOK SHARP WE MAY BE ABLE TO DISCOVER ONE OF THESE SECRET WAYS
lbi-1272-135031-0018 OH NO I'M QUITE SURE HE DIDN'T
lbi-1272-135031-0019 THAT'S FUNNY REMARKED BETSY THOUGHTFULLY
lbi-1272-135031-0020 I DON'T BELIEVE ANN KNEW ANY MAGIC OR SHE'D HAVE WORKED IT BEFORE
lbi-1272-135031-0021 I DO NOT KNOW CONFESSED SHAGGY
lbi-1272-135031-0022 TRUE AGREED KALIKO
lbi-1272-135031-0023 KALIKO WENT TO THE BIG GONG AND POUNDED ON IT JUST AS RUGGEDO USED TO DO BUT NO ONE ANSWERED THE SUMMONS
lbi-1272-135031-0024 HAVING RETURNED TO THE ROYAL CAVERN KALIKO FIRST POUNDED THE GONG AND THEN SAT IN THE THRONE WEARING RUGGEDO'S DISCARDED RUBY CROWN AND HOLDING IN HIS HAND THE SCEPTRE WHICH RUGGEDO HAD SO OFTEN THROWN AT HIS HEAD
lbi-1272-141231-0000 A MAN SAID TO THE UNIVERSE SIR I EXIST
lbi-1272-141231-0001 SWEAT COVERED BRION'S BODY TRICKLING INTO THE TIGHT LOINCLOTH THAT WAS THE ONLY GARMENT HE WORE
lbi-1272-141231-0002 THE CUT ON HIS CHEST STILL DRIPPING BLOOD THE ACHE OF HIS OVERSTRAINED EYES EVEN THE SOARING ARENA AROUND HIM WITH THE THOUSANDS OF SPECTATORS WERE TRIVIALITIES NOT WORTH THINKING ABOUT
lbi-1272-141231-0003 HIS INSTANT OF PANIC WAS FOLLOWED BY A SMALL SHARP BLOW HIGH ON HIS CHEST
lbi-1272-141231-0004 ONE MINUTE A VOICE SAID AND THE TIME BUZZER SOUNDED
lbi-1272-141231-0005 A MINUTE IS NOT A VERY LARGE MEASURE OF TIME AND HIS BODY NEEDED EVERY FRACTION OF IT
lbi-1272-141231-0006 THE BUZZER'S WHIRR TRIGGERED HIS MUSCLES INTO COMPLETE RELAXATION
lbi-1272-141231-0007 ONLY HIS HEART AND LUNGS WORKED ON AT A STRONG MEASURED RATE
lbi-1272-141231-0008 HE WAS IN REVERIE SLIDING ALONG THE BORDERS OF CONSCIOUSNESS
lbi-1272-141231-0009 THE CONTESTANTS IN THE TWENTIES NEEDED UNDISTURBED REST THEREFORE NIGHTS IN THE DORMITORIES WERE AS QUIET AS DEATH
lbi-1272-141231-0010 PARTICULARLY SO ON THIS LAST NIGHT WHEN ONLY TWO OF THE LITTLE CUBICLES WERE OCCUPIED THE THOUSANDS OF OTHERS STANDING WITH DARK EMPTY DOORS
lbi-1272-141231-0011 THE OTHER VOICE SNAPPED WITH A HARSH URGENCY CLEARLY USED TO COMMAND
lbi-1272-141231-0012 I'M HERE BECAUSE THE MATTER IS OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE AND BRANDD IS THE ONE I MUST SEE NOW STAND ASIDE
lbi-1272-141231-0013 THE TWENTIES
lbi-1272-141231-0014 HE MUST HAVE DRAWN HIS GUN BECAUSE THE INTRUDER SAID QUICKLY PUT THAT AWAY YOU'RE BEING A FOOL OUT
lbi-1272-141231-0015 THERE WAS SILENCE THEN AND STILL WONDERING BRION WAS ONCE MORE ASLEEP
lbi-1272-141231-0016 TEN SECONDS
lbi-1272-141231-0017 HE ASKED THE HANDLER WHO WAS KNEADING HIS ACHING MUSCLES
lbi-1272-141231-0018 A RED HAIRED MOUNTAIN OF A MAN WITH AN APPARENTLY INEXHAUSTIBLE STORE OF ENERGY
lbi-1272-141231-0019 THERE COULD BE LITTLE ART IN THIS LAST AND FINAL ROUND OF FENCING
lbi-1272-141231-0020 JUST THRUST AND PARRY AND VICTORY TO THE STRONGER
lbi-1272-141231-0021 EVERY MAN WHO ENTERED THE TWENTIES HAD HIS OWN TRAINING TRICKS
lbi-1272-141231-0022 THERE APPEARED TO BE AN IMMEDIATE ASSOCIATION WITH THE DEATH TRAUMA AS IF THE TWO WERE INEXTRICABLY LINKED INTO ONE
lbi-1272-141231-0023 THE STRENGTH THAT ENABLES SOMEONE IN A TRANCE TO HOLD HIS BODY STIFF AND UNSUPPORTED EXCEPT AT TWO POINTS THE HEAD AND HEELS
lbi-1272-141231-0024 THIS IS PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE WHEN CONSCIOUS
lbi-1272-141231-0025 OTHERS HAD DIED BEFORE DURING THE TWENTIES AND DEATH DURING THE LAST ROUND WAS IN SOME WAYS EASIER THAN DEFEAT
lbi-1272-141231-0026 BREATHING DEEPLY BRION SOFTLY SPOKE THE AUTO HYPNOTIC PHRASES THAT TRIGGERED THE PROCESS
lbi-1272-141231-0027 WHEN THE BUZZER SOUNDED HE PULLED HIS FOIL FROM HIS SECOND'S STARTLED GRASP AND RAN FORWARD
lbi-1272-141231-0028 IROLG LOOKED AMAZED AT THE SUDDEN FURY OF THE ATTACK THEN SMILED
lbi-1272-141231-0029 HE THOUGHT IT WAS A LAST BURST OF ENERGY HE KNEW HOW CLOSE THEY BOTH WERE TO EXHAUSTION
lbi-1272-141231-0030 BRION SAW SOMETHING CLOSE TO PANIC ON HIS OPPONENT'S FACE WHEN THE MAN FINALLY RECOGNIZED HIS ERROR
lbi-1272-141231-0031 A WAVE OF DESPAIR ROLLED OUT FROM IROLG BRION SENSED IT AND KNEW THE FIFTH POINT WAS HIS
lbi-1272-141231-0032 THEN THE POWERFUL TWIST THAT THRUST IT ASIDE IN AND UNDER THE GUARD
lbi-1462-170138-0000 HE HAD WRITTEN A NUMBER OF BOOKS HIMSELF AMONG THEM A HISTORY OF DANCING A HISTORY OF COSTUME A KEY TO SHAKESPEARE'S SONNETS A STUDY OF THE POETRY OF ERNEST DOWSON ET CETERA
lbi-1462-170138-0001 HUGH'S WRITTEN A DELIGHTFUL PART FOR HER AND SHE'S QUITE INEXPRESSIBLE
lbi-1462-170138-0002 I HAPPEN TO HAVE MAC CONNELL'S BOX FOR TONIGHT OR THERE'D BE NO CHANCE OF OUR GETTING PLACES
lbi-1462-170138-0003 ALEXANDER EXCLAIMED MILDLY
lbi-1462-170138-0004 MYSELF I ALWAYS KNEW SHE HAD IT IN HER
lbi-1462-170138-0005 DO YOU KNOW ALEXANDER MAINHALL LOOKED WITH PERPLEXITY UP INTO THE TOP OF THE HANSOM AND RUBBED HIS PINK CHEEK WITH HIS GLOVED FINGER DO YOU KNOW I SOMETIMES THINK OF TAKING TO CRITICISM SERIOUSLY MYSELF
lbi-1462-170138-0006 WHEN THEY ENTERED THE STAGE BOX ON THE LEFT THE FIRST ACT WAS WELL UNDER WAY THE SCENE BEING THE INTERIOR OF A CABIN IN THE SOUTH OF IRELAND
lbi-1462-170138-0007 AS THEY SAT DOWN A BURST OF APPLAUSE DREW ALEXANDER'S ATTENTION TO THE STAGE
lbi-1462-170138-0008 OF COURSE HILDA IS IRISH THE BURGOYNES HAVE BEEN STAGE PEOPLE FOR GENERATIONS AND SHE HAS THE IRISH VOICE
lbi-1462-170138-0009 IT'S DELIGHTFUL TO HEAR IT IN A LONDON THEATRE
lbi-1462-170138-0010 WHEN SHE BEGAN TO DANCE BY WAY OF SHOWING THE GOSSOONS WHAT SHE HAD SEEN IN THE FAIRY RINGS AT NIGHT THE HOUSE BROKE INTO A PROLONGED UPROAR
lbi-1462-170138-0011 AFTER HER DANCE SHE WITHDREW FROM THE DIALOGUE AND RETREATED TO THE DITCH WALL BACK OF PHILLY'S BURROW WHERE SHE SAT SINGING THE RISING OF THE MOON AND MAKING A WREATH OF PRIMROSES FOR HER DONKEY
lbi-1462-170138-0012 MAC CONNELL LET ME INTRODUCE MISTER BARTLEY ALEXANDER
lbi-1462-170138-0013 THE PLAYWRIGHT GAVE MAINHALL A CURIOUS LOOK OUT OF HIS DEEP SET FADED EYES AND MADE A WRY FACE
lbi-1462-170138-0014 HE NODDED CURTLY AND MADE FOR THE DOOR DODGING ACQUAINTANCES AS HE WENT
lbi-1462-170138-0015 I DARE SAY IT'S QUITE TRUE THAT THERE'S NEVER BEEN ANY ONE ELSE
lbi-1462-170138-0016 HE'S ANOTHER WHO'S AWFULLY KEEN ABOUT HER LET ME INTRODUCE YOU
lbi-1462-170138-0017 SIR HARRY TOWNE BOWED AND SAID THAT HE HAD MET MISTER ALEXANDER AND HIS WIFE IN TOKYO
lbi-1462-170138-0018 I SAY SIR HARRY THE LITTLE GIRL'S GOING FAMOUSLY TO NIGHT ISN'T SHE
lbi-1462-170138-0019 THE FACT IS SHE'S FEELING RATHER SEEDY POOR CHILD
lbi-1462-170138-0020 A LITTLE ATTACK OF NERVES POSSIBLY
lbi-1462-170138-0021 HE BOWED AS THE WARNING BELL RANG AND MAINHALL WHISPERED YOU KNOW LORD WESTMERE OF COURSE THE STOOPED MAN WITH THE LONG GRAY MUSTACHE TALKING TO LADY DOWLE
lbi-1462-170138-0022 IN A MOMENT PEGGY WAS ON THE STAGE AGAIN AND ALEXANDER APPLAUDED VIGOROUSLY WITH THE REST
lbi-1462-170138-0023 IN THE HALF LIGHT HE LOOKED ABOUT AT THE STALLS AND BOXES AND SMILED A LITTLE CONSCIOUSLY RECALLING WITH AMUSEMENT SIR HARRY'S JUDICIAL FROWN
lbi-1462-170138-0024 HE LEANED FORWARD AND BEAMED FELICITATIONS AS WARMLY AS MAINHALL HIMSELF WHEN AT THE END OF THE PLAY SHE CAME AGAIN AND AGAIN BEFORE THE CURTAIN PANTING A LITTLE AND FLUSHED HER EYES DANCING AND HER EAGER NERVOUS LITTLE MOUTH TREMULOUS WITH EXCITEMENT
lbi-1462-170138-0025 ALL THE SAME HE LIFTED HIS GLASS HERE'S TO YOU LITTLE HILDA
lbi-1462-170138-0026 I'M GLAD SHE'S HELD HER OWN SINCE
lbi-1462-170138-0027 IT WAS YOUTH AND POVERTY AND PROXIMITY AND EVERYTHING WAS YOUNG AND KINDLY
lbi-1462-170142-0000 THE LAST TWO DAYS OF THE VOYAGE BARTLEY FOUND ALMOST INTOLERABLE
lbi-1462-170142-0001 EMERGING AT EUSTON AT HALF PAST THREE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON ALEXANDER HAD HIS LUGGAGE SENT TO THE SAVOY AND DROVE AT ONCE TO BEDFORD SQUARE
lbi-1462-170142-0002 SHE BLUSHED AND SMILED AND FUMBLED HIS CARD IN HER CONFUSION BEFORE SHE RAN UPSTAIRS
lbi-1462-170142-0003 THE ROOM WAS EMPTY WHEN HE ENTERED
lbi-1462-170142-0004 A COAL FIRE WAS CRACKLING IN THE GRATE AND THE LAMPS WERE LIT FOR IT WAS ALREADY BEGINNING TO GROW DARK OUTSIDE
lbi-1462-170142-0005 SHE CALLED HIS NAME ON THE THRESHOLD BUT IN HER SWIFT FLIGHT ACROSS THE ROOM SHE FELT A CHANGE IN HIM AND CAUGHT HERSELF UP SO DEFTLY THAT HE COULD NOT TELL JUST WHEN SHE DID IT
lbi-1462-170142-0006 SHE MERELY BRUSHED HIS CHEEK WITH HER LIPS AND PUT A HAND LIGHTLY AND JOYOUSLY ON EITHER SHOULDER
lbi-1462-170142-0007 I NEVER DREAMED IT WOULD BE YOU BARTLEY
lbi-1462-170142-0008 WHEN DID YOU COME BARTLEY AND HOW DID IT HAPPEN YOU HAVEN'T SPOKEN A WORD
lbi-1462-170142-0009 SHE LOOKED AT HIS HEAVY SHOULDERS AND BIG DETERMINED HEAD THRUST FORWARD LIKE A CATAPULT IN LEASH
lbi-1462-170142-0010 I'LL DO ANYTHING YOU WISH ME TO BARTLEY SHE SAID TREMULOUSLY
lbi-1462-170142-0011 HE PULLED UP A WINDOW AS IF THE AIR WERE HEAVY
lbi-1462-170142-0012 HILDA WATCHED HIM FROM HER CORNER TREMBLING AND SCARCELY BREATHING DARK SHADOWS GROWING ABOUT HER EYES
lbi-1462-170142-0013 IT IT HASN'T ALWAYS MADE YOU MISERABLE HAS IT
lbi-1462-170142-0014 ALWAYS BUT IT'S WORSE NOW
lbi-1462-170142-0015 IT'S UNBEARABLE IT TORTURES ME EVERY MINUTE
lbi-1462-170142-0016 I AM NOT A MAN WHO CAN LIVE TWO LIVES HE WENT ON FEVERISHLY EACH LIFE SPOILS THE OTHER
lbi-1462-170142-0017 I GET NOTHING BUT MISERY OUT OF EITHER
lbi-1462-170142-0018 THERE IS THIS DECEPTION BETWEEN ME AND EVERYTHING
lbi-1462-170142-0019 AT THAT WORD DECEPTION SPOKEN WITH SUCH SELF CONTEMPT THE COLOR FLASHED BACK INTO HILDA'S FACE AS SUDDENLY AS IF SHE HAD BEEN STRUCK BY A WHIPLASH
lbi-1462-170142-0020 SHE BIT HER LIP AND LOOKED DOWN AT HER HANDS WHICH WERE CLASPED TIGHTLY IN FRONT OF HER
lbi-1462-170142-0021 COULD YOU COULD YOU SIT DOWN AND TALK ABOUT IT QUIETLY BARTLEY AS IF I WERE A FRIEND AND NOT SOME ONE WHO HAD TO BE DEFIED
lbi-1462-170142-0022 HE DROPPED BACK HEAVILY INTO HIS CHAIR BY THE FIRE
lbi-1462-170142-0023 I HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT IT UNTIL I AM WORN OUT
lbi-1462-170142-0024 AFTER THE VERY FIRST
lbi-1462-170142-0025 HILDA'S FACE QUIVERED BUT SHE WHISPERED YES I THINK IT MUST HAVE BEEN
lbi-1462-170142-0026 SHE PRESSED HIS HAND GENTLY IN GRATITUDE WEREN'T YOU HAPPY THEN AT ALL
lbi-1462-170142-0027 SOMETHING OF THEIR TROUBLING SWEETNESS CAME BACK TO ALEXANDER TOO
lbi-1462-170142-0028 PRESENTLY IT STOLE BACK TO HIS COAT SLEEVE
lbi-1462-170142-0029 YES HILDA I KNOW THAT HE SAID SIMPLY
lbi-1462-170142-0030 I UNDERSTAND BARTLEY I WAS WRONG
lbi-1462-170142-0031 SHE LISTENED INTENTLY BUT SHE HEARD NOTHING BUT THE CREAKING OF HIS CHAIR
lbi-1462-170142-0032 YOU WANT ME TO SAY IT SHE WHISPERED
lbi-1462-170142-0033 BARTLEY LEANED HIS HEAD IN HIS HANDS AND SPOKE THROUGH HIS TEETH
lbi-1462-170142-0034 IT'S GOT TO BE A CLEAN BREAK HILDA
lbi-1462-170142-0035 OH BARTLEY WHAT AM I TO DO
lbi-1462-170142-0036 YOU ASK ME TO STAY AWAY FROM YOU BECAUSE YOU WANT ME
lbi-1462-170142-0037 I WILL ASK THE LEAST IMAGINABLE BUT I MUST HAVE SOMETHING
lbi-1462-170142-0038 HILDA SAT ON THE ARM OF IT AND PUT HER HANDS LIGHTLY ON HIS SHOULDERS
lbi-1462-170142-0039 YOU SEE LOVING SOME ONE AS I LOVE YOU MAKES THE WHOLE WORLD DIFFERENT
lbi-1462-170142-0040 AND THEN YOU CAME BACK NOT CARING VERY MUCH BUT IT MADE NO DIFFERENCE
lbi-1462-170142-0041 SHE SLID TO THE FLOOR BESIDE HIM AS IF SHE WERE TOO TIRED TO SIT UP ANY LONGER
lbi-1462-170142-0042 DON'T CRY DON'T CRY HE WHISPERED
lbi-1462-170145-0000 ON THE LAST SATURDAY IN APRIL THE NEW YORK TIMES PUBLISHED AN ACCOUNT OF THE STRIKE COMPLICATIONS WHICH WERE DELAYING ALEXANDER'S NEW JERSEY BRIDGE AND STATED THAT THE ENGINEER HIMSELF WAS IN TOWN AND AT HIS OFFICE ON WEST TENTH STREET
lbi-1462-170145-0001 OVER THE FIREPLACE THERE WAS A LARGE OLD FASHIONED GILT MIRROR
lbi-1462-170145-0002 HE ROSE AND CROSSED THE ROOM QUICKLY
lbi-1462-170145-0003 OF COURSE I KNOW BARTLEY SHE SAID AT LAST THAT AFTER THIS YOU WON'T OWE ME THE LEAST CONSIDERATION BUT WE SAIL ON TUESDAY
lbi-1462-170145-0004 I SAW THAT INTERVIEW IN THE PAPER YESTERDAY TELLING WHERE YOU WERE AND I THOUGHT I HAD TO SEE YOU THAT'S ALL GOOD NIGHT I'M GOING NOW
lbi-1462-170145-0005 LET ME TAKE OFF YOUR COAT AND YOUR BOOTS THEY'RE OOZING WATER
lbi-1462-170145-0006 IF YOU'D SENT ME A NOTE OR TELEPHONED ME OR ANYTHING
lbi-1462-170145-0007 I TOLD MYSELF THAT IF I WERE REALLY THINKING OF YOU AND NOT OF MYSELF A LETTER WOULD BE BETTER THAN NOTHING
lbi-1462-170145-0008 HE PAUSED THEY NEVER DID TO ME
lbi-1462-170145-0009 OH BARTLEY DID YOU WRITE TO ME
lbi-1462-170145-0010 ALEXANDER SLIPPED HIS ARM ABOUT HER
lbi-1462-170145-0011 I THINK I HAVE FELT THAT YOU WERE COMING
lbi-1462-170145-0012 HE BENT HIS FACE OVER HER HAIR
lbi-1462-170145-0013 AND I SHE WHISPERED I FELT THAT YOU WERE FEELING THAT
lbi-1462-170145-0014 BUT WHEN I CAME I THOUGHT I HAD BEEN MISTAKEN
lbi-1462-170145-0015 I'VE BEEN UP IN CANADA WITH MY BRIDGE AND I ARRANGED NOT TO COME TO NEW YORK UNTIL AFTER YOU HAD GONE
lbi-1462-170145-0016 THEN WHEN YOUR MANAGER ADDED TWO MORE WEEKS I WAS ALREADY COMMITTED
lbi-1462-170145-0017 I'M GOING TO DO WHAT YOU ASKED ME TO DO WHEN YOU WERE IN LONDON
lbi-1462-170145-0018 ONLY I'LL DO IT MORE COMPLETELY
lbi-1462-170145-0019 THEN YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
lbi-1462-170145-0020 YES I KNOW VERY WELL
lbi-1462-170145-0021 ALEXANDER FLUSHED ANGRILY
lbi-1462-170145-0022 I DON'T KNOW WHAT I OUGHT TO SAY BUT I DON'T BELIEVE YOU'D BE HAPPY TRULY I DON'T AREN'T YOU TRYING TO FRIGHTEN ME
lbi-1673-143396-0000 A LAUDABLE REGARD FOR THE HONOR OF THE FIRST PROSELYTE HAS COUNTENANCED THE BELIEF THE HOPE THE WISH THAT THE EBIONITES OR AT LEAST THE NAZARENES WERE DISTINGUISHED ONLY BY THEIR OBSTINATE PERSEVERANCE IN THE PRACTICE OF THE MOSAIC RITES
lbi-1673-143396-0001 THEIR CHURCHES HAVE DISAPPEARED THEIR BOOKS ARE OBLITERATED THEIR OBSCURE FREEDOM MIGHT ALLOW A LATITUDE OF FAITH AND THE SOFTNESS OF THEIR INFANT CREED WOULD BE VARIOUSLY MOULDED BY THE ZEAL OR PRUDENCE OF THREE HUNDRED YEARS
lbi-1673-143396-0002 YET THE MOST CHARITABLE CRITICISM MUST REFUSE THESE SECTARIES ANY KNOWLEDGE OF THE PURE AND PROPER DIVINITY OF CHRIST
lbi-1673-143396-0003 HIS PROGRESS FROM INFANCY TO YOUTH AND MANHOOD WAS MARKED BY A REGULAR INCREASE IN STATURE AND WISDOM AND AFTER A PAINFUL AGONY OF MIND AND BODY HE EXPIRED ON THE CROSS
lbi-1673-143396-0004 HE LIVED AND DIED FOR THE SERVICE OF MANKIND BUT THE LIFE AND DEATH OF SOCRATES HAD LIKEWISE BEEN DEVOTED TO THE CAUSE OF RELIGION AND JUSTICE AND ALTHOUGH THE STOIC OR THE HERO MAY DISDAIN THE HUMBLE VIRTUES OF JESUS THE TEARS WHICH HE SHED OVER HIS FRIEND AND COUNTRY MAY BE ESTEEMED THE PUREST EVIDENCE OF HIS HUMANITY
lbi-1673-143396-0005 THE SON OF A VIRGIN GENERATED BY THE INEFFABLE OPERATION OF THE HOLY SPIRIT WAS A CREATURE WITHOUT EXAMPLE OR RESEMBLANCE SUPERIOR IN EVERY ATTRIBUTE OF MIND AND BODY TO THE CHILDREN OF ADAM
lbi-1673-143396-0006 NOR COULD IT SEEM STRANGE OR INCREDIBLE THAT THE FIRST OF THESE AEONS THE LOGOS OR WORD OF GOD OF THE SAME SUBSTANCE WITH THE FATHER SHOULD DESCEND UPON EARTH TO DELIVER THE HUMAN RACE FROM VICE AND ERROR AND TO CONDUCT THEM IN THE PATHS OF LIFE AND IMMORTALITY
lbi-1673-143396-0007 BUT THE PREVAILING DOCTRINE OF THE ETERNITY AND INHERENT PRAVITY OF MATTER INFECTED THE PRIMITIVE CHURCHES OF THE EAST
lbi-1673-143396-0008 MANY AMONG THE GENTILE PROSELYTES REFUSED TO BELIEVE THAT A CELESTIAL SPIRIT AN UNDIVIDED PORTION OF THE FIRST ESSENCE HAD BEEN PERSONALLY UNITED WITH A MASS OF IMPURE AND CONTAMINATED FLESH AND IN THEIR ZEAL FOR THE DIVINITY THEY PIOUSLY ABJURED THE HUMANITY OF CHRIST
lbi-1673-143396-0009 HE FIRST APPEARED ON THE BANKS OF THE JORDAN IN THE FORM OF PERFECT MANHOOD BUT IT WAS A FORM ONLY AND NOT A SUBSTANCE A HUMAN FIGURE CREATED BY THE HAND OF OMNIPOTENCE TO IMITATE THE FACULTIES AND ACTIONS OF A MAN AND TO IMPOSE A PERPETUAL ILLUSION ON THE SENSES OF HIS FRIENDS AND ENEMIES
lbi-1673-143396-0010 BUT THE RASHNESS OF THESE CONCESSIONS HAS ENCOURAGED A MILDER SENTIMENT OF THOSE OF THE DOCETES WHO TAUGHT NOT THAT CHRIST WAS A PHANTOM BUT THAT HE WAS CLOTHED WITH AN IMPASSIBLE AND INCORRUPTIBLE BODY
lbi-1673-143396-0011 A FOETUS THAT COULD INCREASE FROM AN INVISIBLE POINT TO ITS FULL MATURITY A CHILD THAT COULD ATTAIN THE STATURE OF PERFECT MANHOOD WITHOUT DERIVING ANY NOURISHMENT FROM THE ORDINARY SOURCES MIGHT CONTINUE TO EXIST WITHOUT REPAIRING A DAILY WASTE BY A DAILY SUPPLY OF EXTERNAL MATTER
lbi-1673-143396-0012 IN THEIR EYES JESUS OF NAZARETH WAS A MERE MORTAL THE LEGITIMATE SON OF JOSEPH AND MARY BUT HE WAS THE BEST AND WISEST OF THE HUMAN RACE SELECTED AS THE WORTHY INSTRUMENT TO RESTORE UPON EARTH THE WORSHIP OF THE TRUE AND SUPREME DEITY
lbi-1673-143396-0013 WHEN THE MESSIAH WAS DELIVERED INTO THE HANDS OF THE JEWS THE CHRIST AN IMMORTAL AND IMPASSIBLE BEING FORSOOK HIS EARTHLY TABERNACLE FLEW BACK TO THE PLEROMA OR WORLD OF SPIRITS AND LEFT THE SOLITARY JESUS TO SUFFER TO COMPLAIN AND TO EXPIRE
lbi-1673-143396-0014 BUT THE JUSTICE AND GENEROSITY OF SUCH A DESERTION ARE STRONGLY QUESTIONABLE AND THE FATE OF AN INNOCENT MARTYR AT FIRST IMPELLED AND AT LENGTH ABANDONED BY HIS DIVINE COMPANION MIGHT PROVOKE THE PITY AND INDIGNATION OF THE PROFANE
lbi-1673-143396-0015 THEIR MURMURS WERE VARIOUSLY SILENCED BY THE SECTARIES WHO ESPOUSED AND MODIFIED THE DOUBLE SYSTEM OF CERINTHUS
lbi-1673-143396-0016 THE WORTHY FRIEND OF ATHANASIUS THE WORTHY ANTAGONIST OF JULIAN HE BRAVELY WRESTLED WITH THE ARIANS AND POLYTHEISTS AND THOUGH HE AFFECTED THE RIGOR OF GEOMETRICAL DEMONSTRATION HIS COMMENTARIES REVEALED THE LITERAL AND ALLEGORICAL SENSE OF THE SCRIPTURES
lbi-1673-143396-0017 YET AS THE PROFOUND DOCTOR HAD BEEN TERRIFIED AT HIS OWN RASHNESS APOLLINARIS WAS HEARD TO MUTTER SOME FAINT ACCENTS OF EXCUSE AND EXPLANATION
lbi-1673-143396-0018 HE ACQUIESCED IN THE OLD DISTINCTION OF THE GREEK PHILOSOPHERS BETWEEN THE RATIONAL AND SENSITIVE SOUL OF MAN THAT HE MIGHT RESERVE THE LOGOS FOR INTELLECTUAL FUNCTIONS AND EMPLOY THE SUBORDINATE HUMAN PRINCIPLE IN THE MEANER ACTIONS OF ANIMAL LIFE
lbi-1673-143396-0019 BUT INSTEAD OF A TEMPORARY AND OCCASIONAL ALLIANCE THEY ESTABLISHED AND WE STILL EMBRACE THE SUBSTANTIAL INDISSOLUBLE AND EVERLASTING UNION OF A PERFECT GOD WITH A PERFECT MAN OF THE SECOND PERSON OF THE TRINITY WITH A REASONABLE SOUL AND HUMAN FLESH
lbi-1673-143396-0020 UNDER THE TUITION OF THE ABBOT SERAPION HE APPLIED HIMSELF TO ECCLESIASTICAL STUDIES WITH SUCH INDEFATIGABLE ARDOR THAT IN THE COURSE OF ONE SLEEPLESS NIGHT HE HAS PERUSED THE FOUR GOSPELS THE CATHOLIC EPISTLES AND THE EPISTLE TO THE ROMANS
lbi-1673-143397-0000 ARDENT IN THE PROSECUTION OF HERESY CYRIL AUSPICIOUSLY OPENED HIS REIGN BY OPPRESSING THE NOVATIANS THE MOST INNOCENT AND HARMLESS OF THE SECTARIES
lbi-1673-143397-0001 WITHOUT ANY LEGAL SENTENCE WITHOUT ANY ROYAL MANDATE THE PATRIARCH AT THE DAWN OF DAY LED A SEDITIOUS MULTITUDE TO THE ATTACK OF THE SYNAGOGUES
lbi-1673-143397-0002 SUCH CRIMES WOULD HAVE DESERVED THE ANIMADVERSION OF THE MAGISTRATE BUT IN THIS PROMISCUOUS OUTRAGE THE INNOCENT WERE CONFOUNDED WITH THE GUILTY AND ALEXANDRIA WAS IMPOVERISHED BY THE LOSS OF A WEALTHY AND INDUSTRIOUS COLONY
lbi-1673-143397-0003 THE ZEAL OF CYRIL EXPOSED HIM TO THE PENALTIES OF THE JULIAN LAW BUT IN A FEEBLE GOVERNMENT AND A SUPERSTITIOUS AGE HE WAS SECURE OF IMPUNITY AND EVEN OF PRAISE
lbi-1673-143397-0004 ORESTES COMPLAINED BUT HIS JUST COMPLAINTS WERE TOO QUICKLY FORGOTTEN BY THE MINISTERS OF THEODOSIUS AND TOO DEEPLY REMEMBERED BY A PRIEST WHO AFFECTED TO PARDON AND CONTINUED TO HATE THE PRAEFECT OF EGYPT
lbi-1673-143397-0005 A RUMOR WAS SPREAD AMONG THE CHRISTIANS THAT THE DAUGHTER OF THEON WAS THE ONLY OBSTACLE TO THE RECONCILIATION OF THE PRAEFECT AND THE ARCHBISHOP AND THAT OBSTACLE WAS SPEEDILY REMOVED
lbi-1673-143397-0006 WHICH OPPRESSED THE METROPOLITANS OF EUROPE AND ASIA INVADED THE PROVINCES OF ANTIOCH AND ALEXANDRIA AND MEASURED THEIR DIOCESE BY THE LIMITS OF THE EMPIRE
lbi-1673-143397-0007 EXTERMINATE WITH ME THE HERETICS AND WITH YOU I WILL EXTERMINATE THE PERSIANS
lbi-1673-143397-0008 AT THESE BLASPHEMOUS SOUNDS THE PILLARS OF THE SANCTUARY WERE SHAKEN
lbi-1673-143397-0009 BUT THE VATICAN RECEIVED WITH OPEN ARMS THE MESSENGERS OF EGYPT
lbi-1673-143397-0010 THE VANITY OF CELESTINE WAS FLATTERED BY THE APPEAL AND THE PARTIAL VERSION OF A MONK DECIDED THE FAITH OF THE POPE WHO WITH HIS LATIN CLERGY WAS IGNORANT OF THE LANGUAGE THE ARTS AND THE THEOLOGY OF THE GREEKS
lbi-1673-143397-0011 NESTORIUS WHO DEPENDED ON THE NEAR APPROACH OF HIS EASTERN FRIENDS PERSISTED LIKE HIS PREDECESSOR CHRYSOSTOM TO DISCLAIM THE JURISDICTION AND TO DISOBEY THE SUMMONS OF HIS ENEMIES THEY HASTENED HIS TRIAL AND HIS ACCUSER PRESIDED IN THE SEAT OF JUDGMENT
lbi-1673-143397-0012 SIXTY EIGHT BISHOPS TWENTY TWO OF METROPOLITAN RANK DEFENDED HIS CAUSE BY A MODEST AND TEMPERATE PROTEST THEY WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE COUNCILS OF THEIR BRETHREN
lbi-1673-143397-0013 BY THE VIGILANCE OF MEMNON THE CHURCHES WERE SHUT AGAINST THEM AND A STRONG GARRISON WAS THROWN INTO THE CATHEDRAL
lbi-1673-143397-0014 DURING A BUSY PERIOD OF THREE MONTHS THE EMPEROR TRIED EVERY METHOD EXCEPT THE MOST EFFECTUAL MEANS OF INDIFFERENCE AND CONTEMPT TO RECONCILE THIS THEOLOGICAL QUARREL
lbi-1673-143397-0015 RETURN TO YOUR PROVINCES AND MAY YOUR PRIVATE VIRTUES REPAIR THE MISCHIEF AND SCANDAL OF YOUR MEETING
lbi-1673-143397-0016 THE FEEBLE SON OF ARCADIUS WAS ALTERNATELY SWAYED BY HIS WIFE AND SISTER BY THE EUNUCHS AND WOMEN OF THE PALACE SUPERSTITION AND AVARICE WERE THEIR RULING PASSIONS AND THE ORTHODOX CHIEFS WERE ASSIDUOUS IN THEIR ENDEAVORS TO ALARM THE FORMER AND TO GRATIFY THE LATTER
lbi-1673-143397-0017 BUT IN THIS AWFUL MOMENT OF THE DANGER OF THE CHURCH THEIR VOW WAS SUPERSEDED BY A MORE SUBLIME AND INDISPENSABLE DUTY
lbi-1673-143397-0018 AT THE SAME TIME EVERY AVENUE OF THE THRONE WAS ASSAULTED WITH GOLD
lbi-1673-143397-0019 THE PAST HE REGRETTED HE WAS DISCONTENTED WITH THE PRESENT AND THE FUTURE HE HAD REASON TO DREAD THE ORIENTAL BISHOPS SUCCESSIVELY DISENGAGED THEIR CAUSE FROM HIS UNPOPULAR NAME AND EACH DAY DECREASED THE NUMBER OF THE SCHISMATICS WHO REVERED NESTORIUS AS THE CONFESSOR OF THE FAITH
lbi-1673-143397-0020 A WANDERING TRIBE OF THE BLEMMYES OR NUBIANS INVADED HIS SOLITARY PRISON IN THEIR RETREAT THEY DISMISSED A CROWD OF USELESS CAPTIVES BUT NO SOONER HAD NESTORIUS REACHED THE BANKS OF THE NILE THAN HE WOULD GLADLY HAVE ESCAPED FROM A ROMAN AND ORTHODOX CITY TO THE MILDER SERVITUDE OF THE SAVAGES
lbi-174-168635-0000 HE HAD NEVER BEEN FATHER LOVER HUSBAND FRIEND
lbi-174-168635-0001 THE HEART OF THAT EX CONVICT WAS FULL OF VIRGINITY
lbi-174-168635-0002 HIS SISTER AND HIS SISTER'S CHILDREN HAD LEFT HIM ONLY A VAGUE AND FAR OFF MEMORY WHICH HAD FINALLY ALMOST COMPLETELY VANISHED HE HAD MADE EVERY EFFORT TO FIND THEM AND NOT HAVING BEEN ABLE TO FIND THEM HE HAD FORGOTTEN THEM
lbi-174-168635-0003 HE SUFFERED ALL THE PANGS OF A MOTHER AND HE KNEW NOT WHAT IT MEANT FOR THAT GREAT AND SINGULAR MOVEMENT OF A HEART WHICH BEGINS TO LOVE IS A VERY OBSCURE AND A VERY SWEET THING
lbi-174-168635-0004 ONLY AS HE WAS FIVE AND FIFTY AND COSETTE EIGHT YEARS OF AGE ALL THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN LOVE IN THE WHOLE COURSE OF HIS LIFE FLOWED TOGETHER INTO A SORT OF INEFFABLE LIGHT
lbi-174-168635-0005 COSETTE ON HER SIDE HAD ALSO UNKNOWN TO HERSELF BECOME ANOTHER BEING POOR LITTLE THING
lbi-174-168635-0006 SHE FELT THAT WHICH SHE HAD NEVER FELT BEFORE A SENSATION OF EXPANSION
lbi-174-168635-0007 THE MAN NO LONGER PRODUCED ON HER THE EFFECT OF BEING OLD OR POOR SHE THOUGHT JEAN VALJEAN HANDSOME JUST AS SHE THOUGHT THE HOVEL PRETTY
lbi-174-168635-0008 NATURE A DIFFERENCE OF FIFTY YEARS HAD SET A PROFOUND GULF BETWEEN JEAN VALJEAN AND COSETTE DESTINY FILLED IN THIS GULF
lbi-174-168635-0009 TO MEET WAS TO FIND EACH OTHER
lbi-174-168635-0010 WHEN THESE TWO SOULS PERCEIVED EACH OTHER THEY RECOGNIZED EACH OTHER AS NECESSARY TO EACH OTHER AND EMBRACED EACH OTHER CLOSELY
lbi-174-168635-0011 MOREOVER JEAN VALJEAN HAD CHOSEN HIS REFUGE WELL
lbi-174-168635-0012 HE HAD PAID HER SIX MONTHS IN ADVANCE AND HAD COMMISSIONED THE OLD WOMAN TO FURNISH THE CHAMBER AND DRESSING ROOM AS WE HAVE SEEN
lbi-174-168635-0013 WEEK FOLLOWED WEEK THESE TWO BEINGS LED A HAPPY LIFE IN THAT HOVEL
lbi-174-168635-0014 COSETTE WAS NO LONGER IN RAGS SHE WAS IN MOURNING
lbi-174-168635-0015 AND THEN HE TALKED OF HER MOTHER AND HE MADE HER PRAY
lbi-174-168635-0016 HE PASSED HOURS IN WATCHING HER DRESSING AND UNDRESSING HER DOLL AND IN LISTENING TO HER PRATTLE
lbi-174-168635-0017 THE BEST OF US ARE NOT EXEMPT FROM EGOTISTICAL THOUGHTS
lbi-174-168635-0018 HE HAD RETURNED TO PRISON THIS TIME FOR HAVING DONE RIGHT HE HAD QUAFFED FRESH BITTERNESS DISGUST AND LASSITUDE WERE OVERPOWERING HIM EVEN THE MEMORY OF THE BISHOP PROBABLY SUFFERED A TEMPORARY ECLIPSE THOUGH SURE TO REAPPEAR LATER ON LUMINOUS AND TRIUMPHANT BUT AFTER ALL THAT SACRED MEMORY WAS GROWING DIM
lbi-174-168635-0019 WHO KNOWS WHETHER JEAN VALJEAN HAD NOT BEEN ON THE EVE OF GROWING DISCOURAGED AND OF FALLING ONCE MORE
lbi-174-168635-0020 ALAS HE WALKED WITH NO LESS INDECISION THAN COSETTE
lbi-174-168635-0021 HE PROTECTED HER AND SHE STRENGTHENED HIM
lbi-174-168635-0022 HE WAS THAT CHILD'S STAY AND SHE WAS HIS PROP
lbi-174-50561-0000 FORGOTTEN TOO THE NAME OF GILLIAN THE LOVELY CAPTIVE
lbi-174-50561-0001 WORSE AND WORSE HE IS EVEN PRESUMED TO BE THE CAPTIVE'S SWEETHEART WHO WHEEDLES THE FLOWER THE RING AND THE PRISON KEY OUT OF THE STRICT VIRGINS FOR HIS OWN PURPOSES AND FLIES WITH HER AT LAST IN HIS SHALLOP ACROSS THE SEA TO LIVE WITH HER HAPPILY EVER AFTER
lbi-174-50561-0002 BUT THIS IS A FALLACY
lbi-174-50561-0003 THE WANDERING SINGER APPROACHES THEM WITH HIS LUTE
lbi-174-50561-0004 THE EMPEROR'S DAUGHTER

lbi-174-50561-0019 YOU SEE THE TREATMENT IS A TRIFLE FANCIFUL
lbi-174-84280-0000 HOW WE MUST SIMPLIFY
lbi-174-84280-0001 IT SEEMS TO ME MORE AND MORE AS I LIVE LONGER THAT MOST POETRY AND MOST LITERATURE AND PARTICULARLY THE LITERATURE OF THE PAST IS DISCORDANT WITH THE VASTNESS AND VARIETY THE RESERVES AND RESOURCES AND RECUPERATIONS OF LIFE AS WE LIVE IT TO DAY
lbi-174-84280-0002 IT IS THE EXPRESSION OF LIFE UNDER CRUDER AND MORE RIGID CONDITIONS THAN OURS LIVED BY PEOPLE WHO LOVED AND HATED MORE NAIVELY AGED SOONER AND DIED YOUNGER THAN WE DO
lbi-174-84280-0003 WE RANGE WIDER LAST LONGER AND ESCAPE MORE AND MORE FROM INTENSITY TOWARDS UNDERSTANDING
lbi-174-84280-0004 AND ALREADY THIS ASTOUNDING BLOW BEGINS TO TAKE ITS PLACE AMONG OTHER EVENTS AS A THING STRANGE AND TERRIBLE INDEED BUT RELATED TO ALL THE STRANGENESS AND MYSTERY OF LIFE PART OF THE UNIVERSAL MYSTERIES OF DESPAIR AND FUTILITY AND DEATH THAT HAVE TROUBLED MY CONSCIOUSNESS SINCE CHILDHOOD
lbi-174-84280-0005 FOR A TIME THE DEATH OF MARY OBSCURED HER LIFE FOR ME BUT NOW HER LIVING PRESENCE IS MORE IN MY MIND AGAIN

lbi-174-84280-0010 IF WE HAD BEEN BROTHER AND SISTER INDEED THERE WAS NOTHING

lbi-174-84280-0012 AND IT IS UPON THIS EFFECT OF SWEET AND BEAUTIFUL POSSIBILITIES CAUGHT IN THE NET OF ANIMAL JEALOUSIES AND THOUGHTLESS MOTIVES AND ANCIENT RIGID INSTITUTIONS THAT I WOULD END THIS WRITING
lbi-174-84280-0013 IN MARY IT SEEMS TO ME I FOUND BOTH WOMANHOOD AND FELLOWSHIP I FOUND WHAT MANY HAVE DREAMT OF LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP FREELY GIVEN AND I COULD DO NOTHING BUT CLUTCH AT HER TO MAKE HER MY POSSESSION

lbi-1988-147956-0010 I REMEMBERED WHAT THE CONDUCTOR HAD SAID ABOUT HER EYES
lbi-1988-147956-0011 HER SKIN WAS BROWN TOO AND IN HER CHEEKS SHE HAD A GLOW OF RICH DARK COLOR
lbi-1988-147956-0012 EVEN FROM A DISTANCE ONE COULD SEE THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING STRANGE ABOUT THIS BOY
lbi-1988-147956-0013 HE WAS BORN LIKE THAT THE OTHERS ARE SMART
lbi-1988-147956-0014 AMBROSCH HE MAKE GOOD FARMER
lbi-1988-147956-0015 HE STRUCK AMBROSCH ON THE BACK AND THE BOY SMILED KNOWINGLY
lbi-1988-147956-0016 AT THAT MOMENT THE FATHER CAME OUT OF THE HOLE IN THE BANK
lbi-1988-147956-0017 IT WAS SO LONG THAT IT BUSHED OUT BEHIND HIS EARS AND MADE HIM LOOK LIKE THE OLD PORTRAITS I REMEMBERED IN VIRGINIA
lbi-1988-147956-0018 I NOTICED HOW WHITE AND WELL SHAPED HIS OWN HANDS WERE
lbi-1988-147956-0019 WE STOOD PANTING ON THE EDGE OF THE RAVINE LOOKING DOWN AT THE TREES AND BUSHES THAT GREW BELOW US
lbi-1988-147956-0020 THE WIND WAS SO STRONG THAT I HAD TO HOLD MY HAT ON AND THE GIRLS SKIRTS WERE BLOWN OUT BEFORE THEM
lbi-1988-147956-0021 SHE LOOKED AT ME HER EYES FAIRLY BLAZING WITH THINGS SHE COULD NOT SAY
lbi-1988-147956-0022 SHE POINTED INTO THE GOLD COTTONWOOD TREE BEHIND WHOSE TOP WE STOOD AND SAID AGAIN WHAT NAME
lbi-1988-147956-0023 ANTONIA POINTED UP TO THE SKY AND QUESTIONED ME WITH HER GLANCE
lbi-1988-147956-0024 SHE GOT UP ON HER KNEES AND WRUNG HER HANDS
lbi-1988-147956-0025 SHE WAS QUICK AND VERY EAGER
lbi-1988-147956-0026 WE WERE SO DEEP IN THE GRASS THAT WE COULD SEE NOTHING BUT THE BLUE SKY OVER US AND THE GOLD TREE IN FRONT OF US
lbi-1988-147956-0027 AFTER ANTONIA HAD SAID THE NEW WORDS OVER AND OVER SHE WANTED TO GIVE ME A LITTLE CHASED SILVER RING SHE WORE ON HER MIDDLE FINGER
lbi-1988-147956-0028 WHEN I CAME UP HE TOUCHED MY SHOULDER AND LOOKED SEARCHINGLY DOWN INTO MY FACE FOR SEVERAL SECONDS
lbi-1988-147956-0029 I BECAME SOMEWHAT EMBARRASSED FOR I WAS USED TO BEING TAKEN FOR GRANTED BY MY ELDERS
lbi-1988-148538-0000 IN ARISTOCRATIC COMMUNITIES THE PEOPLE READILY GIVE THEMSELVES UP TO BURSTS OF TUMULTUOUS AND BOISTEROUS GAYETY WHICH SHAKE OFF AT ONCE THE RECOLLECTION OF THEIR PRIVATIONS THE NATIVES OF DEMOCRACIES ARE NOT FOND OF BEING THUS VIOLENTLY BROKEN IN UPON AND THEY NEVER LOSE SIGHT OF THEIR OWN SELVES WITHOUT REGRET
lbi-1988-148538-0001 AN AMERICAN INSTEAD OF GOING IN A LEISURE HOUR TO DANCE MERRILY AT SOME PLACE OF PUBLIC RESORT AS THE FELLOWS OF HIS CALLING CONTINUE TO DO THROUGHOUT THE GREATER PART OF EUROPE SHUTS HIMSELF UP AT HOME TO DRINK
lbi-1988-148538-0002 I BELIEVE THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE AMERICANS ARISES PARTLY FROM THEIR PRIDE
lbi-1988-148538-0003 THIS IS MORE ESPECIALLY THE CASE AMONGST THOSE FREE NATIONS WHICH FORM DEMOCRATIC COMMUNITIES
lbi-1988-148538-0004 THEN THERE ARE IN ALL CLASSES A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF MEN CONSTANTLY OCCUPIED WITH THE SERIOUS AFFAIRS OF THE GOVERNMENT AND THOSE WHOSE THOUGHTS ARE NOT ENGAGED IN THE DIRECTION OF THE COMMONWEALTH ARE WHOLLY ENGROSSED BY THE ACQUISITION OF A PRIVATE FORTUNE
lbi-1988-148538-0005 I DO NOT BELIEVE IN SUCH REPUBLICS ANY MORE THAN IN THAT OF PLATO OR IF THE THINGS WE READ OF REALLY HAPPENED I DO NOT HESITATE TO AFFIRM THAT THESE SUPPOSED DEMOCRACIES WERE COMPOSED OF VERY DIFFERENT ELEMENTS FROM OURS AND THAT THEY HAD NOTHING IN COMMON WITH THE LATTER EXCEPT THEIR NAME
lbi-1988-148538-0006 IN ARISTOCRACIES EVERY MAN HAS ONE SOLE OBJECT WHICH HE UNCEASINGLY PURSUES BUT AMONGST DEMOCRATIC NATIONS THE EXISTENCE OF MAN IS MORE COMPLEX THE SAME MIND WILL ALMOST ALWAYS EMBRACE SEVERAL OBJECTS AT THE SAME TIME AND THESE OBJECTS ARE FREQUENTLY WHOLLY FOREIGN TO EACH OTHER AS IT CANNOT KNOW THEM ALL WELL THE MIND IS READILY SATISFIED WITH IMPERFECT NOTIONS OF EACH
lbi-1988-148538-0007 CHAPTER SIXTEEN WHY THE NATIONAL VANITY OF THE AMERICANS IS MORE RESTLESS AND CAPTIOUS THAN THAT OF THE ENGLISH
lbi-1988-148538-0008 THE AMERICANS IN THEIR INTERCOURSE WITH STRANGERS APPEAR IMPATIENT OF THE SMALLEST CENSURE AND INSATIABLE OF PRAISE
lbi-1988-148538-0009 IF I SAY TO AN AMERICAN THAT THE COUNTRY HE LIVES IN IS A FINE ONE AY HE REPLIES THERE IS NOT ITS FELLOW IN THE WORLD
lbi-1988-148538-0010 IF I APPLAUD THE FREEDOM WHICH ITS INHABITANTS ENJOY HE ANSWERS FREEDOM IS A FINE THING BUT FEW NATIONS ARE WORTHY TO ENJOY IT
lbi-1988-148538-0011 IN ARISTOCRATIC COUNTRIES THE GREAT POSSESS IMMENSE PRIVILEGES UPON WHICH THEIR PRIDE RESTS WITHOUT SEEKING TO RELY UPON THE LESSER ADVANTAGES WHICH ACCRUE TO THEM
lbi-1988-148538-0012 THEY THEREFORE ENTERTAIN A CALM SENSE OF THEIR SUPERIORITY THEY DO NOT DREAM OF VAUNTING PRIVILEGES WHICH EVERYONE PERCEIVES AND NO ONE CONTESTS AND THESE THINGS ARE NOT SUFFICIENTLY NEW TO THEM TO BE MADE TOPICS OF CONVERSATION
lbi-1988-148538-0013 THEY STAND UNMOVED IN THEIR SOLITARY GREATNESS WELL ASSURED THAT THEY ARE SEEN OF ALL THE WORLD WITHOUT ANY EFFORT TO SHOW THEMSELVES OFF AND THAT NO ONE WILL ATTEMPT TO DRIVE THEM FROM THAT POSITION
lbi-1988-148538-0014 WHEN AN ARISTOCRACY CARRIES ON THE PUBLIC AFFAIRS ITS NATIONAL PRIDE NATURALLY ASSUMES THIS RESERVED INDIFFERENT AND HAUGHTY FORM WHICH IS IMITATED BY ALL THE OTHER CLASSES OF THE NATION
lbi-1988-148538-0015 THESE PERSONS THEN DISPLAYED TOWARDS EACH OTHER PRECISELY THE SAME PUERILE JEALOUSIES WHICH ANIMATE THE MEN OF DEMOCRACIES THE SAME EAGERNESS TO SNATCH THE SMALLEST ADVANTAGES WHICH THEIR EQUALS CONTESTED AND THE SAME DESIRE TO PARADE OSTENTATIOUSLY THOSE OF WHICH THEY WERE IN POSSESSION
lbi-1988-24833-0000 THE TWO STRAY KITTENS GRADUALLY MAKE THEMSELVES AT HOME
lbi-1988-24833-0001 SOMEHOW OR OTHER CAT HAS TAUGHT THEM THAT HE'S IN CHARGE HERE AND HE JUST CHASES THEM FOR FUN NOW AND AGAIN WHEN HE'S NOT BUSY SLEEPING
lbi-1988-24833-0002 SHE DOESN'T PICK THEM UP BUT JUST HAVING THEM IN THE ROOM SURE DOESN'T GIVE HER ASTHMA
lbi-1988-24833-0003 WHEN ARE YOU GETTING RID OF THESE CATS I'M NOT FIXING TO START AN ANNEX TO KATE'S CAT HOME
lbi-1988-24833-0004 RIGHT AWAY WHEN I BRING HOME MY NEW PROGRAM HE SAYS HOW COME YOU'RE TAKING ONE LESS COURSE THIS HALF
lbi-1988-24833-0005 I EXPLAIN THAT I'M TAKING MUSIC AND ALSO BIOLOGY ALGEBRA ENGLISH AND FRENCH MUSIC HE SNORTS
lbi-1988-24833-0006 POP IT'S A COURSE
lbi-1988-24833-0007 HE DOES AND FOR ONCE I WIN A ROUND I KEEP MUSIC FOR THIS SEMESTER
lbi-1988-24833-0008 I'LL BE LUCKY IF I HAVE TIME TO BREATHE
lbi-1988-24833-0009 SOMETIMES SCHOOLS DO LET KIDS TAKE A LOT OF SOFT COURSES AND THEN THEY'RE OUT ON A LIMB LATER HUH
lbi-1988-24833-0010 SO HE CARES HUH
lbi-1988-24833-0011 BESIDES SAYS TOM HALF THE REASON YOU AND YOUR FATHER ARE ALWAYS BICKERING IS THAT YOU'RE SO MUCH ALIKE ME LIKE HIM SURE
lbi-1988-24833-0012 AS LONG AS THERE'S A BONE ON THE FLOOR THE TWO OF YOU WORRY IT
lbi-1988-24833-0013 I GET THE PILLOWS COMFORTABLY ARRANGED ON THE FLOOR WITH A BIG BOTTLE OF SODA AND A BAG OF POPCORN WITHIN EASY REACH
lbi-1988-24833-0014 POP GOES RIGHT ON TUNING HIS CHANNEL
lbi-1988-24833-0015 YOU'RE GETTING ALTOGETHER TOO UPSET ABOUT THESE PROGRAMS STOP IT AND BEHAVE YOURSELF
lbi-1988-24833-0016 IT'S YOUR FAULT MOP IT UP YOURSELF
lbi-1988-24833-0017 I HEAR THE T V GOING FOR A FEW MINUTES THEN POP TURNS IT OFF AND GOES IN THE KITCHEN TO TALK TO MOM
lbi-1988-24833-0018 WELL I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD TURN A GUY'S T V PROGRAM OFF IN THE MIDDLE WITHOUT EVEN FINDING OUT ABOUT IT
lbi-1988-24833-0019 I LOOK AT MY WATCH IT'S A QUARTER TO ELEVEN
lbi-1988-24833-0020 I TURN OFF THE TELEVISION SET I'VE LOST TRACK OF WHAT'S HAPPENING AND IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE THE GRANDFATHER WHO'S THE SPOOK AFTER ALL
lbi-1988-24833-0021 IT'S THE FIRST TIME HILDA HAS BEEN TO OUR HOUSE AND TOM INTRODUCES HER AROUND
lbi-1988-24833-0022 I TOLD TOM WE SHOULDN'T COME SO LATE SAYS HILDA
lbi-1988-24833-0023 TOM SAYS THANKS AND LOOKS AT HILDA AND SHE BLUSHES REALLY
lbi-1988-24833-0024 TOM DRINKS A LITTLE MORE COFFEE AND THEN HE GOES ON THE TROUBLE IS I CAN'T GET MARRIED ON THIS FLOWER SHOP JOB
lbi-1988-24833-0025 YOU KNOW I'D GET DRAFTED IN A YEAR OR TWO ANYWAY
lbi-1988-24833-0026 I'VE DECIDED TO ENLIST IN THE ARMY
lbi-1988-24833-0027 I'LL HAVE TO CHECK SOME MORE SAYS TOM
lbi-1988-24833-0028 HERE'S TO YOU A LONG HAPPY LIFE
lbi-1993-147149-0000 HOW INFINITE THE WEALTH OF LOVE AND HOPE GARNERED IN THESE SAME TINY TREASURE HOUSES AND OH
lbi-1993-147149-0001 WHAT BANKRUPTS IN THE WORLD WE FEEL WHEN DEATH LIKE SOME REMORSELESS CREDITOR SEIZES ON ALL WE FONDLY THOUGHT OUR OWN THE TWINS
lbi-1993-147149-0002 THE GHOUL LIKE FEVER WAS NOT TO BE BRAVED WITH IMPUNITY AND BAULKED OF ITS PREY
lbi-1993-147149-0003 THE BOARD NOT SO FORMIDABLE AS SHE HAD IMAGINED HAD INQUIRED INTO HER CASE AND INSTEAD OF SENDING HER TO STOKE CLAYPOLE HER HUSBAND'S BUCKINGHAMSHIRE PARISH AS SHE HAD DREADED HAD AGREED TO PAY HER RENT
lbi-1993-147149-0004 MARGARET MET JEM WILSON SEVERAL DAYS AFTER HIS BROTHERS WERE SERIOUSLY ILL AND HEARD FROM HIM THE STATE OF THINGS AT HIS HOME
lbi-1993-147149-0005 SHE STOPPED WITH HER HAND ON THE LATCH OF THE WILSONS DOOR TO STILL HER BEATING HEART AND LISTENED TO THE HUSHED QUIET WITHIN
lbi-1993-147149-0006 SHE OPENED THE DOOR SOFTLY THERE SAT MISSUS WILSON IN THE OLD ROCKING CHAIR WITH ONE SICK DEATH LIKE BOY LYING ON HER KNEE CRYING WITHOUT LET OR PAUSE BUT SOFTLY GENTLY AS FEARING TO DISTURB THE TROUBLED GASPING CHILD WHILE BEHIND HER OLD ALICE LET HER FAST DROPPING TEARS FALL DOWN ON THE DEAD BODY OF THE OTHER TWIN WHICH SHE WAS LAYING OUT ON A BOARD PLACED ON A SORT OF SOFA SETTEE IN A CORNER OF THE ROOM
lbi-1993-147149-0007 OVER THE CHILD WHICH YET BREATHED THE FATHER BENT WATCHING ANXIOUSLY FOR SOME GROUND OF HOPE WHERE HOPE THERE WAS NONE
lbi-1993-147149-0008 IS THERE ANY CHANCE FOR THE OTHER ONE THINK YOU
lbi-1993-147149-0009 BUT EARNEST AS THE FATHER WAS IN WATCHING THE YET LIVING HE HAD EYES AND EARS FOR ALL THAT CONCERNED THE DEAD AND SPRANG GENTLY UP AND TOOK HIS DEAD SON ON HIS HARD COUCH IN HIS ARMS WITH TENDER STRENGTH AND CARRIED HIM UPSTAIRS AS IF AFRAID OF WAKENING HIM
lbi-1993-147149-0010 WISHING HIM SAID MARY IN A TONE OF INQUIRY
lbi-1993-147149-0011 THEN THE MOTHER LIFTED UP HER VOICE AND WEPT
lbi-1993-147149-0012 HER CRIES BROUGHT HER HUSBAND DOWN TO TRY WITH HIS ACHING HEART TO COMFORT HERS
lbi-1993-147149-0013 MARY AND ALICE DREW NEAR THE FIRE AND STOOD IN QUIET SORROW FOR SOME TIME
lbi-1993-147149-0014 THEN ALICE BROKE THE SILENCE BY SAYING
lbi-1993-147149-0015 AFORE CHRISTMAS TIME I WAS AS FULL AS FULL COULD BE OF GOING HOME FOR GOOD AND ALL YO HAN HEARD HOW I'VE WISHED IT THIS TERRIBLE LONG TIME
lbi-1993-147149-0016 BUT HE STAYED LONG THERE AND AT LAST HIS STURDY FRAME SHOOK WITH HIS STRONG AGONY
lbi-1993-147149-0017 OH JEM DON'T GIVE WAY SO I CANNOT BEAR TO SEE YOU
lbi-1993-147149-0018 HE DID NOT SPEAK AS THOUGH FEARING TO DESTROY BY SOUND OR MOTION THE HAPPINESS OF THAT MOMENT WHEN HER SOFT HAND'S TOUCH THRILLED THROUGH HIS FRAME AND HER SILVERY VOICE WAS WHISPERING TENDERNESS IN HIS EAR
lbi-1993-147149-0019 DON'T JEM PLEASE DON'T WHISPERED SHE AGAIN BELIEVING THAT HIS SILENCE WAS ONLY ANOTHER FORM OF GRIEF
lbi-1993-147149-0020 MARY I ALMOST LOATHE MYSELF WHEN I FEEL I WOULD NOT GIVE UP THIS MINUTE WHEN MY BROTHERS LIE DEAD AND FATHER AND MOTHER ARE IN SUCH TROUBLE FOR ALL MY LIFE THAT'S PAST AND GONE AND MARY AS SHE TRIED TO RELEASE HER HAND YOU KNOW WHAT MAKES ME FEEL SO BLESSED
lbi-1993-147149-0021 HE REMAINED UP STAIRS UNTIL AFTER THE EARLY DAWN SHOWED MARY THAT SHE NEED HAVE NO FEAR OF GOING HOME THROUGH THE DESERTED AND QUIET STREETS TO TRY AND GET A LITTLE SLEEP BEFORE WORK HOUR
lbi-1993-147149-0022 SO LEAVING KIND MESSAGES TO GEORGE AND JANE WILSON AND HESITATING WHETHER SHE MIGHT DARE TO SEND A FEW KIND WORDS TO JEM AND DECIDING THAT SHE HAD BETTER NOT SHE STEPPED OUT INTO THE BRIGHT MORNING LIGHT SO FRESH A CONTRAST TO THE DARKENED ROOM WHERE DEATH HAD BEEN
lbi-1993-147149-0023 HER THOUGHTS RAN ON JEM'S MANNER AND WORDS NOT BUT WHAT SHE HAD KNOWN THE TALE THEY TOLD FOR MANY A DAY BUT STILL SHE WISHED HE HAD NOT PUT IT SO PLAINLY
lbi-1993-147149-0024 I CANNOT THINK WHAT POSSESSES ME THAT I MUST ALWAYS BE WANTING TO COMFORT HIM WHEN HE'S DOWNCAST AND THAT I MUST GO MEDDLING WI HIM TO NIGHT WHEN SURE ENOUGH IT WAS HIS AUNT'S PLACE TO SPEAK TO HIM
lbi-1993-147149-0025 I THINK I CANNOT GO RIGHT FOR I EITHER CHECK MYSELF TILL I'M DOWNRIGHT CROSS TO HIM OR ELSE I SPEAK JUST NATURAL AND THAT'S TOO KIND AND TENDER BY HALF
lbi-1993-147149-0026 BUT WILL HE THANK ME FOR IT
lbi-1993-147149-0027 THERE WAS SOMETHING OF KEEN PRACTICAL SHREWDNESS ABOUT HER WHICH CONTRASTED VERY BEWITCHINGLY WITH THE SIMPLE FOOLISH UNWORLDLY IDEAS SHE HAD PICKED UP FROM THE ROMANCES WHICH MISS SIMMONDS YOUNG LADIES WERE IN THE HABIT OF RECOMMENDING TO EACH OTHER YES
lbi-1993-147149-0028 THE OLD LEAVEN INFUSED YEARS AGO BY HER AUNT ESTHER FERMENTED IN HER LITTLE BOSOM AND PERHAPS ALL THE MORE FOR HER FATHER'S AVERSION TO THE RICH AND THE GENTLE
lbi-1993-147149-0029 IT WAS A COMFORT TO HER WHEN SCOLDED BY MISS SIMMONDS TO THINK OF THE DAY WHEN SHE WOULD DRIVE UP TO THE DOOR IN HER OWN CARRIAGE TO ORDER HER GOWNS FROM THE HASTY TEMPERED YET KIND DRESSMAKER
lbi-1993-147149-0030 BUT THE BEST OF HER PLANS THE HOLIEST THAT WHICH IN SOME MEASURE REDEEMED THE VANITY OF THE REST WERE THOSE RELATING TO HER FATHER HER DEAR FATHER NOW OPPRESSED WITH CARE AND ALWAYS A DISHEARTENED GLOOMY PERSON
lbi-1993-147964-0000 THEY SAT ABOUT THE HOUSE MOST OF THE DAY AS IF IT WERE SUNDAY GREASING THEIR BOOTS MENDING THEIR SUSPENDERS PLAITING WHIPLASHES
lbi-1993-147964-0001 ANYWAY HE WOULD NEVER ALLOW ONE OF HIS HORSES TO BE PUT TO SUCH A STRAIN
lbi-1993-147964-0002 I HAD WANTED TO GET SOME PICTURE BOOKS FOR YULKA AND ANTONIA EVEN YULKA WAS ABLE TO READ A LITTLE NOW
lbi-1993-147964-0003 SHE CUT SQUARES OF COTTON CLOTH AND WE SEWED THEM TOGETHER INTO A BOOK
lbi-1993-147964-0004 ON THE WHITE PAGES I GROUPED SUNDAY SCHOOL CARDS AND ADVERTISING CARDS WHICH I HAD BROUGHT FROM MY OLD COUNTRY
lbi-1993-147964-0005 WHEN HE MOUNTED HIS HORSE AT THE DOOR I SAW THAT HE HAD A HATCHET SLUNG TO HIS BELT AND HE GAVE GRANDMOTHER A MEANING LOOK WHICH TOLD ME HE WAS PLANNING A SURPRISE FOR ME
lbi-1993-147964-0006 I PUT ON MY CAP AND RAN OUT TO MEET JAKE
lbi-1993-147964-0007 HE USED TO HELP MY FATHER CUT CHRISTMAS TREES FOR ME IN VIRGINIA AND HE HAD NOT FORGOTTEN HOW MUCH I LIKED THEM
lbi-1993-147964-0008 BY THE TIME WE HAD PLACED THE COLD FRESH SMELLING LITTLE TREE IN A CORNER OF THE SITTING ROOM IT WAS ALREADY CHRISTMAS EVE
lbi-1993-147964-0009 FROM UNDER THE LINING HE NOW PRODUCED A COLLECTION OF BRILLIANTLY COLORED PAPER FIGURES SEVERAL INCHES HIGH AND STIFF ENOUGH TO STAND ALONE
lbi-1993-147964-0010 I CAN SEE THEM NOW EXACTLY AS THEY LOOKED WORKING ABOUT THE TABLE IN THE LAMPLIGHT JAKE WITH HIS HEAVY FEATURES SO RUDELY MOULDED THAT HIS FACE SEEMED SOMEHOW UNFINISHED OTTO WITH HIS HALF EAR AND THE SAVAGE SCAR THAT MADE HIS UPPER LIP CURL SO FEROCIOUSLY UNDER HIS TWISTED MUSTACHE
lbi-1993-147965-0000 GRANDFATHER CAME DOWN WEARING A WHITE SHIRT AND HIS SUNDAY COAT
lbi-1993-147965-0001 MORNING PRAYERS WERE LONGER THAN USUAL
lbi-1993-147965-0002 HE GAVE THANKS FOR OUR FOOD AND COMFORT AND PRAYED FOR THE POOR AND DESTITUTE IN GREAT CITIES WHERE THE STRUGGLE FOR LIFE WAS HARDER THAN IT WAS HERE WITH US
lbi-1993-147965-0003 BECAUSE HE TALKED SO LITTLE HIS WORDS HAD A PECULIAR FORCE THEY WERE NOT WORN DULL FROM CONSTANT USE
lbi-1993-147965-0004 ALL AFTERNOON HE SAT IN THE DINING ROOM
lbi-1993-147965-0005 AT ABOUT FOUR O'CLOCK A VISITOR APPEARED MISTER SHIMERDA WEARING HIS RABBIT SKIN CAP AND COLLAR AND NEW MITTENS HIS WIFE HAD KNITTED
lbi-1993-147965-0006 HE SAT STILL AND PASSIVE HIS HEAD RESTING AGAINST THE BACK OF THE WOODEN ROCKING CHAIR HIS HANDS RELAXED UPON THE ARMS
lbi-1993-147965-0007 HIS FACE HAD A LOOK OF WEARINESS AND PLEASURE LIKE THAT OF SICK PEOPLE WHEN THEY FEEL RELIEF FROM PAIN
lbi-1993-147965-0008 HE MADE THE SIGN OF THE CROSS OVER ME PUT ON HIS CAP AND WENT OFF IN THE DARK
lbi-1993-147966-0000 THE WEEK FOLLOWING CHRISTMAS BROUGHT IN A THAW AND BY NEW YEAR'S DAY ALL THE WORLD ABOUT US WAS A BROTH OF GRAY SLUSH AND THE GUTTERED SLOPE BETWEEN THE WINDMILL AND THE BARN WAS RUNNING BLACK WATER
lbi-1993-147966-0001 IT WAS THE FIRST TIME MISSUS SHIMERDA HAD BEEN TO OUR HOUSE AND SHE RAN ABOUT EXAMINING OUR CARPETS AND CURTAINS AND FURNITURE ALL THE WHILE COMMENTING UPON THEM TO HER DAUGHTER IN AN ENVIOUS COMPLAINING TONE
lbi-1993-147966-0002 YOUR MAMA I SAID ANGRILY WANTS OTHER PEOPLE'S THINGS
lbi-1993-147966-0003 FOR AMBROSCH MY MAMA COME HERE
lbi-1993-147966-0004 BUT YOU SEE A BODY NEVER KNOWS WHAT TRAITS POVERTY MIGHT BRING OUT IN EM
lbi-1993-147966-0005 THEY BEGAN TO LAUGH BOISTEROUSLY WHEN THEY SAW ME CALLING
lbi-1993-147966-0006 YOU'VE GOT A BIRTHDAY PRESENT THIS TIME JIM AND NO MISTAKE
lbi-2035-147960-0000 SHE WAS FOUR YEARS OLDER THAN I TO BE SURE AND HAD SEEN MORE OF THE WORLD BUT I WAS A BOY AND SHE WAS A GIRL AND I RESENTED HER PROTECTING MANNER
lbi-2035-147960-0001 THIS CHANGE CAME ABOUT FROM AN ADVENTURE WE HAD TOGETHER
lbi-2035-147960-0002 ONE DAY WHEN I RODE OVER TO THE SHIMERDAS I FOUND ANTONIA STARTING OFF ON FOOT FOR RUSSIAN PETER'S HOUSE TO BORROW A SPADE AMBROSCH NEEDED
lbi-2035-147960-0003 THERE HAD BEEN ANOTHER BLACK FROST THE NIGHT BEFORE AND THE AIR WAS CLEAR AND HEADY AS WINE
lbi-2035-147960-0004 IT WAS ON ONE OF THESE GRAVEL BEDS THAT I MET MY ADVENTURE
lbi-2035-147960-0005 I WHIRLED ROUND AND THERE ON ONE OF THOSE DRY GRAVEL BEDS WAS THE BIGGEST SNAKE I HAD EVER SEEN
lbi-2035-147960-0006 I KNOW I AM JUST AWFUL JIM I WAS SO SCARED
lbi-2035-147960-0007 I NEVER KNOW YOU WAS SO BRAVE JIM SHE WENT ON COMFORTINGLY
lbi-2035-147960-0008 A FAINT FETID SMELL CAME FROM HIM AND A THREAD OF GREEN LIQUID OOZED FROM HIS CRUSHED HEAD
lbi-2035-147960-0009 LOOK TONY THAT'S HIS POISON I SAID
lbi-2035-147960-0010 I EXPLAINED TO ANTONIA HOW THIS MEANT THAT HE WAS TWENTY FOUR YEARS OLD THAT HE MUST HAVE BEEN THERE WHEN WHITE MEN FIRST CAME LEFT ON FROM BUFFALO AND INDIAN TIMES
lbi-2035-147960-0011 WE DECIDED THAT ANTONIA SHOULD RIDE DUDE HOME AND I WOULD WALK
lbi-2035-147960-0012 I FOLLOWED WITH THE SPADE OVER MY SHOULDER DRAGGING MY SNAKE
lbi-2035-147960-0013 OTTO FUCHS WAS THE FIRST ONE WE MET
lbi-2035-147960-0014 HE COULD STAND RIGHT UP AND TALK TO YOU HE COULD DID HE FIGHT HARD
lbi-2035-147960-0015 OTTO WINKED AT ME
lbi-2035-147960-0016 A SNAKE OF HIS SIZE IN FIGHTING TRIM WOULD BE MORE THAN ANY BOY COULD HANDLE
lbi-2035-147961-0000 PETER TOLD HIS TROUBLES TO MISTER SHIMERDA HE WAS UNABLE TO MEET A NOTE WHICH FELL DUE ON THE FIRST OF NOVEMBER HAD TO PAY AN EXORBITANT BONUS ON RENEWING IT AND TO GIVE A MORTGAGE ON HIS PIGS AND HORSES AND EVEN HIS MILK COW
lbi-2035-147961-0001 PETER COULD GIVE NO VERY CLEAR ACCOUNT OF HIS TRANSACTIONS WITH CUTTER
lbi-2035-147961-0002 SHE ASKED PETER TO WAIT A MOMENT AND WHEN SHE CAME BACK FROM THE KITCHEN SHE BROUGHT A BAG OF SANDWICHES AND DOUGHNUTS FOR US
lbi-2035-147961-0003 WE LAY STILL AND DID NOT TALK
lbi-2035-147961-0004 THE LITTLE HOUSE ON THE HILLSIDE WAS SO MUCH THE COLOR OF THE NIGHT THAT WE COULD NOT SEE IT AS WE CAME UP THE DRAW
lbi-2035-147961-0005 THEY MADE ME THINK OF DEFEATED ARMIES RETREATING OR OF GHOSTS WHO WERE TRYING DESPERATELY TO GET IN FOR SHELTER AND THEN WENT MOANING ON
lbi-2035-147961-0006 I COULD NOT TAKE MY EYES OFF THE MAN IN THE BED
lbi-2035-147961-0007 THE SHARP SMELL OF SPIRITS WENT THROUGH THE ROOM
lbi-2035-147961-0008 IT SEEMED TO ME THAT HE DESPISED HIM FOR BEING SO SIMPLE AND DOCILE
lbi-2035-147961-0009 THE SICK MAN RAGED AND SHOOK HIS FIST
lbi-2035-147961-0010 HE SEEMED TO BE CURSING PEOPLE WHO HAD WRONGED HIM
lbi-2035-147961-0011 QUICKLY IT WAS COVERED WITH BRIGHT RED SPOTS I THOUGHT I HAD NEVER SEEN ANY BLOOD SO BRIGHT
lbi-2035-147961-0012 HE LAY PATIENTLY FIGHTING FOR BREATH LIKE A CHILD WITH CROUP
lbi-2035-147961-0013 ANTONIA'S FATHER UNCOVERED ONE OF HIS LONG BONY LEGS AND RUBBED IT RHYTHMICALLY
lbi-2035-147961-0014 FROM OUR BENCH WE COULD SEE WHAT A HOLLOW CASE HIS BODY WAS
lbi-2035-147961-0015 GRADUALLY RELIEF CAME TO ALL OF US
lbi-2035-147961-0016 WITHOUT A WORD PETER GOT UP AND LIT HIS LANTERN
lbi-2035-147961-0017 MISTER SHIMERDA WENT WITH HIM
lbi-2035-147961-0018 AFTER THE CEREMONY AT THE CHURCH THE PARTY WENT TO A DINNER GIVEN BY THE PARENTS OF THE BRIDE
lbi-2035-147961-0019 THE FIRST HOWLS WERE TAKEN UP AND ECHOED AND WITH QUICKENING REPETITIONS
lbi-2035-147961-0020 A BLACK DROVE CAME UP OVER THE HILL BEHIND THE WEDDING PARTY
lbi-2035-147961-0021 SOMETHING HAPPENED TO THE HINDMOST SLEDGE THE DRIVER LOST CONTROL HE WAS PROBABLY VERY DRUNK THE HORSES LEFT THE ROAD THE SLEDGE WAS CAUGHT IN A CLUMP OF TREES AND OVERTURNED
lbi-2035-147961-0022 THE SHRIEKS THAT FOLLOWED MADE EVERYBODY SOBER
lbi-2035-147961-0023 THE ROAD WAS CLEAR AND WHITE AND THE GROOM'S THREE BLACKS WENT LIKE THE WIND
lbi-2035-147961-0024 THERE ARE ONLY THREE SLEDGES LEFT HE WHISPERED
lbi-2035-147961-0025 AND THE WOLVES PAVEL ASKED ENOUGH ENOUGH FOR ALL OF US
lbi-2035-147961-0026 THEY WERE WITHIN A FEW MILES OF THEIR VILLAGE NOW
lbi-2035-147961-0027 YES HOW MANY
lbi-2035-147961-0028 TWENTY THIRTY ENOUGH
lbi-2035-147961-0029 NOW HIS MIDDLE HORSE WAS BEING ALMOST DRAGGED BY THE OTHER TWO

lbi-2035-147961-0031 PETER CROUCHING IN THE FRONT SEAT SAW NOTHING
lbi-2035-147961-0032 THE FIRST THING EITHER OF THEM NOTICED WAS A NEW SOUND THAT BROKE INTO THE CLEAR AIR LOUDER THAN THEY HAD EVER HEARD IT BEFORE THE BELL OF THE MONASTERY OF THEIR OWN VILLAGE RINGING FOR EARLY PRAYERS
lbi-2035-147961-0033 THEY WERE RUN OUT OF THEIR VILLAGE
lbi-2035-147961-0034 WHEREVER THEY WENT THE STORY FOLLOWED THEM
lbi-2035-147961-0035 THEY WORKED IN CHICAGO DES MOINES FORT WAYNE BUT THEY WERE ALWAYS UNFORTUNATE
lbi-2035-147961-0036 DURING THE AUCTION HE WENT ABOUT WITH HIS HEAD DOWN AND NEVER LIFTED HIS EYES
lbi-2035-147961-0037 EVERY ONE SAID PETER KISSED THE COW BEFORE SHE WAS LED AWAY BY HER NEW OWNER
lbi-2035-147961-0038 THE LOSS OF HIS TWO FRIENDS HAD A DEPRESSING EFFECT UPON OLD MISTER SHIMERDA
lbi-2035-147961-0039 WHEN HE WAS OUT HUNTING HE USED TO GO INTO THE EMPTY LOG HOUSE AND SIT THERE BROODING
lbi-2035-147961-0040 THIS CABIN WAS HIS HERMITAGE UNTIL THE WINTER SNOWS PENNED HIM IN HIS CAVE
lbi-2035-152373-0000 THROUGHOUT THIS CENTURY THE POWER OF THE CHURCH WAS CONSTANTLY ON THE INCREASE AND IS VISIBLE IN MANY IMPORTANT CHANGES
lbi-2035-152373-0001 THE ANCESTORS OF THE PRESENT PRETENDER CONGAL SURNAMED THE SQUINT EYED HAD TWICE RECEIVED AND CHERISHED THE LICENTIOUS BARDS WHEN UNDER THE BAN OF TARA AND HIS POPULARITY WITH THAT STILL POWERFUL ORDER WAS ONE PROP OF HIS AMBITION
lbi-2035-152373-0002 IT IS PRETTY CLEAR ALSO THAT THE LAST RALLY OF DRUIDISM AGAINST CHRISTIANITY TOOK PLACE BEHIND HIS BANNER ON THE PLAIN OF MOIRA
lbi-2035-152373-0003 THE POETS OF SUCCEEDING AGES HAVE DWELT MUCH IN DETAIL ON THE OCCURRENCES OF THIS MEMORABLE DAY
lbi-2035-152373-0004 LIKE THE TWO KINGS OF SPARTA THEY REIGNED JOINTLY DIVIDING BETWEEN THEM THE LABOURS AND CARES OF STATE
lbi-2035-152373-0005 IT WAS THE SEASON WHEN THE ANCIENT SUN GOD HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO RECEIVE HIS ANNUAL OBLATIONS AND WE CAN WELL BELIEVE THAT THOSE WHOSE HEARTS STILL TREMBLED AT THE NAME OF BEL MUST HAVE CONNECTED THE ECLIPSE AND THE PLAGUE WITH THE REVOLUTION IN THE NATIONAL WORSHIP AND THE OVERTHROW OF THE ANCIENT GODS ON THAT PLAIN OF PROSTRATION WHERE THEY HAD SO LONG RECEIVED THE HOMAGE OF AN ENTIRE PEOPLE
lbi-2035-152373-0006 LASTLY THE ROYAL BROTHERS FELL THEMSELVES VICTIMS TO THE EPIDEMIC WHICH SO SADLY SIGNALIZES THEIR REIGN
lbi-2035-152373-0007 THE ONLY CONFLICTS THAT OCCURRED ON IRISH SOIL WITH A PICTISH OR AN ANGLO SAXON FORCE IF WE EXCEPT THOSE WHO FORMED A CONTINGENT OF CONGAL'S ARMY AT MOIRA OCCURRED IN THE TIME OF THE HOSPITABLE FINNACTA
lbi-2035-152373-0008 AS LEADING TO THE MENTION OF OTHER INTERESTING EVENTS WE MUST SET THIS INROAD CLEARLY BEFORE THE READER
lbi-2035-152373-0009 THE SAXONS OF KENT AND THE SOUTHERN KINGDOMS GENERALLY WERE CONVERTED BY MISSIONARIES FROM FRANCE OR ROME OR NATIVE PREACHERS OF THE FIRST OR SECOND CHRISTIAN GENERATION THOSE OF NORTHUMBRIA RECOGNISE AS THEIR APOSTLES SAINT AIDAN AND SAINT CUTHBERT TWO FATHERS FROM IONA
lbi-2035-152373-0010 THE KINGDOM OF NORTHUMBRIA AS THE NAME IMPLIES EMBRACED NEARLY ALL THE COUNTRY FROM THE HUMBER TO THE PICTISH BORDER
lbi-2035-152373-0011 THE BARREN ROCK ABOUT THREE MILES IN LENGTH WAS COVERED WITH MONASTIC BUILDINGS AND ITS CEMETERY WAS ALREADY ADORNED WITH THE TOMBS OF SAINTS AND KINGS
lbi-2035-152373-0012 NOW EVERY MISSIONARY THAT EVER WENT OUT FROM IONA HAD TAUGHT THAT TO REDUCE CHRISTIANS TO SLAVERY WAS WHOLLY INCONSISTENT WITH A BELIEF IN THE DOCTRINES OF THE GOSPEL
lbi-2035-152373-0013 WHILE THE LIBERATED EXILES REJOICED ON THE PLAIN OF MEATH THE TENT OF THE ABBOT OF IONA WAS PITCHED ON THE RATH OF TARA A FACT WHICH WOULD SEEM TO INDICATE THAT ALREADY IN LITTLE MORE THAN A CENTURY SINCE THE INTERDICT HAD FALLEN ON IT THE EDIFICES WHICH MADE SO FINE A SHOW IN THE DAYS OF PATRICK WERE RUINED AND UNINHABITABLE
lbi-2035-152373-0014 SO SLOW AND PATIENT IS THE PROCESS BY WHICH CHRISTIANITY INFUSES ITSELF INTO THE SOCIAL LIFE OF A CONVERTED PEOPLE
lbi-2035-152373-0015 HERE THE HOLY PRELATE OF FERNS MET HIM AND RELATED A VISION IN WHICH HE HAD BEEN INSTRUCTED TO DEMAND THE ABOLITION OF THE IMPOST
lbi-2035-152373-0016 THE TRIBUTE WAS AT THIS PERIOD ENORMOUS FIFTEEN THOUSAND HEAD OF CATTLE ANNUALLY
lbi-2035-152373-0017 SAINT MOLING SURVIVED HIM THREE YEARS AND SAINT ADAMNAN SO INTIMATELY CONNECTED WITH HIS REIGN TEN YEARS
lbi-2035-152373-0018 NOTHING COULD BE MORE NATURAL THAN SUCH AN ASSEMBLY IN SUCH A PLACE AT SUCH A PERIOD

lbi-2078-142845-0003 SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN
lbi-2078-142845-0004 MODE PUT THE FLOUR INTO A LARGE EARTHENWARE BOWL OR DEEP PAN THEN WITH A STRONG METAL OR WOODEN SPOON HOLLOW OUT THE MIDDLE BUT DO NOT CLEAR IT ENTIRELY AWAY FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE PAN AS IN THAT CASE THE SPONGE OR LEAVEN AS IT WAS FORMERLY TERMED WOULD STICK TO IT WHICH IT OUGHT NOT TO DO
lbi-2078-142845-0005 NEXT TAKE EITHER A LARGE TABLESPOONFUL OF BREWER'S YEAST WHICH HAS BEEN RENDERED SOLID BY MIXING IT WITH PLENTY OF COLD WATER AND LETTING IT AFTERWARDS STAND TO SETTLE FOR A DAY AND NIGHT OR NEARLY AN OUNCE OF GERMAN YEAST PUT IT INTO A LARGE BASIN AND PROCEED TO MIX IT SO THAT IT SHALL BE AS SMOOTH AS CREAM WITH THREE QUARTERS PINT OF WARM MILK AND WATER OR WITH WATER ONLY THOUGH EVEN A VERY LITTLE MILK WILL MUCH IMPROVE THE BREAD
lbi-2078-142845-0006 LOOK AT IT FROM TIME TO TIME WHEN IT HAS BEEN LAID FOR NEARLY AN HOUR AND WHEN THE YEAST HAS RISEN AND BROKEN THROUGH THE FLOUR SO THAT BUBBLES APPEAR IN IT YOU WILL KNOW THAT IT IS READY TO BE MADE UP INTO DOUGH
lbi-2078-142845-0007 THEN PLACE THE PAN ON A STRONG CHAIR OR DRESSER OR TABLE OF CONVENIENT HEIGHT POUR INTO THE SPONGE THE REMAINDER OF THE WARM MILK AND WATER STIR INTO IT AS MUCH OF THE FLOUR AS YOU CAN WITH THE SPOON THEN WIPE IT OUT CLEAN WITH YOUR FINGERS AND LAY IT ASIDE
lbi-2078-142845-0008 TURN IT THEN ON TO A PASTE BOARD OR VERY CLEAN DRESSER AND WITH A LARGE SHARP KNIFE DIVIDE IT IN TWO MAKE IT UP QUICKLY INTO LOAVES AND DISPATCH IT TO THE OVEN MAKE ONE OR TWO INCISIONS ACROSS THE TOPS OF THE LOAVES AS THEY WILL RISE MORE EASILY IF THIS BE DONE

lbi-2078-142845-0010 ITALIAN MILLET OR GREAT INDIAN MILLET IS CULTIVATED IN EGYPT AND NUBIA WHERE IT IS CALLED DHOURRA AND IS USED AS HUMAN FOOD AS WELL AS FOR THE FERMENTATION OF BEER
lbi-2078-142845-0011 IT WILL GROW ON POOR SOILS AND IS EXTREMELY PRODUCTIVE
lbi-2078-142845-0012 IT HAS BEEN INTRODUCED INTO ITALY WHERE THEY MAKE A COARSE BREAD FROM IT AND IT IS ALSO EMPLOYED IN PASTRY AND PUDDINGS THEY ALSO USE IT FOR FEEDING HORSES AND DOMESTIC FOWLS
lbi-2078-142845-0013 A YELLOW VARIETY CALLED GOLDEN MILLET IS SOLD IN THE GROCERS SHOPS FOR MAKING PUDDINGS AND IS VERY DELICATE AND WHOLESOME
lbi-2078-142845-0014 ANOTHER ADVANTAGE THE RED WHEATS POSSESS IS THEIR COMPARATIVE IMMUNITY FROM THE ATTACKS OF MILDEW AND FLY
lbi-2078-142845-0015 MODE BOIL THE RICE IN WATER UNTIL IT IS QUITE TENDER POUR OFF THE WATER AND PUT THE RICE BEFORE IT IS COLD TO THE FLOUR

lbi-2078-142845-0018 IF CARRIED ANY DISTANCE IT SHOULD BE STORED AWAY IN AIR TIGHT VESSELS
lbi-2078-142845-0019 SOME OF THE PREPARATIONS OF MAIZE FLOUR ARE VERY GOOD AND WHEN PARTAKEN IN MODERATION SUITABLE FOOD FOR ALMOST EVERYBODY
lbi-2078-142845-0020 MODE LET THE TARTARIC ACID AND SALT BE REDUCED TO THE FINEST POSSIBLE POWDER THEN MIX THEM WELL WITH THE FLOUR
lbi-2078-142845-0021 SOUR MILK OR BUTTERMILK MAY BE USED BUT THEN A LITTLE LESS ACID WILL BE NEEDED
lbi-2078-142845-0022 EXCELLENT ROLLS
lbi-2078-142845-0023 HOT ROLLS
lbi-2078-142845-0024 SEVENTEEN TWENTY FOUR
lbi-2078-142845-0025 WHEN THEY ARE QUITE HOT DIVIDE THEM LENGTHWISE INTO THREE PUT SOME THIN FLAKES OF GOOD BUTTER BETWEEN THE SLICES PRESS THE ROLLS TOGETHER AND PUT THEM IN THE OVEN FOR A MINUTE OR TWO BUT NOT LONGER OR THE BUTTER WOULD OIL TAKE THEM OUT OF THE OVEN SPREAD THE BUTTER EQUALLY OVER DIVIDE THE ROLLS IN HALF AND PUT THEM ON TO A VERY HOT CLEAN DISH AND SEND THEM INSTANTLY TO TABLE
lbi-2078-142845-0026 TO MAKE DRY TOAST
lbi-2078-142845-0027 NEVER USE NEW BREAD FOR MAKING ANY KIND OF TOAST AS IT EATS HEAVY AND BESIDES IS VERY EXTRAVAGANT
lbi-2078-142845-0028 MOVE IT BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS UNTIL THE BREAD IS NICELY COLOURED THEN TURN IT AND TOAST THE OTHER SIDE AND DO NOT PLACE IT SO NEAR THE FIRE THAT IT BLACKENS
lbi-2078-142845-0029 TO MAKE HOT BUTTERED TOAST SEVENTEEN TWENTY SIX
lbi-2078-142845-0030 A LOAF OF HOUSEHOLD BREAD ABOUT TWO DAYS OLD ANSWERS FOR MAKING TOAST BETTER THAN COTTAGE BREAD THE LATTER NOT BEING A GOOD SHAPE AND TOO CRUSTY FOR THE PURPOSE
lbi-2078-142845-0031 CUT AS MANY NICE EVEN SLICES AS MAY BE REQUIRED RATHER MORE THAN ONE QUARTER INCH IN THICKNESS AND TOAST THEM BEFORE A VERY BRIGHT FIRE WITHOUT ALLOWING THE BREAD TO BLACKEN WHICH SPOILS THE APPEARANCE AND FLAVOUR OF ALL TOAST
lbi-2078-142845-0032 SOYER RECOMMENDS THAT EACH SLICE SHOULD BE CUT INTO PIECES AS SOON AS IT IS BUTTERED AND WHEN ALL ARE READY THAT THEY SHOULD BE PILED LIGHTLY ON THE DISH THEY ARE INTENDED TO BE SERVED ON
lbi-2078-142845-0033 HE SAYS THAT BY CUTTING THROUGH FOUR OR FIVE SLICES AT A TIME ALL THE BUTTER IS SQUEEZED OUT OF THE UPPER ONES WHILE THE BOTTOM ONE IS SWIMMING IN FAT LIQUID
lbi-2078-142845-0034 MUFFINS AND CRUMPETS SHOULD ALWAYS BE SERVED ON SEPARATE DISHES AND BOTH TOASTED AND SERVED AS EXPEDITIOUSLY AS POSSIBLE
lbi-2078-142845-0035 SUFFICIENT ALLOW TWO CRUMPETS TO EACH PERSON

lbi-2078-142845-0038 FROM FIFTEEN TO TWENTY MINUTES WILL BE REQUIRED TO BAKE THEM NICELY
lbi-2078-142845-0039 THESE BUNS MAY BE VARIED BY ADDING A FEW CURRANTS CANDIED PEEL OR CARAWAY SEEDS TO THE OTHER INGREDIENTS AND THE ABOVE MIXTURE ANSWERS FOR HOT CROSS BUNS BY PUTTING IN A LITTLE GROUND ALLSPICE AND BY PRESSING A TIN MOULD IN THE FORM OF A CROSS IN THE CENTRE OF THE BUN

lbi-2078-142845-0046 IT IS NOT CULTIVATED IN ENGLAND BEING PRINCIPALLY CONFINED TO THE EAST
lbi-2078-142845-0047 WHEN WE TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT THE ARABIANS ARE FOND OF LIZARDS AND LOCUSTS AS ARTICLES OF FOOD THEIR CUISINE ALTOGETHER IS SCARCELY A TEMPTING ONE

lbi-2078-142845-0051 WHEN COLD THEY SHOULD BE PUT INTO TIN CANISTERS TO KEEP THEM DRY AND IF INTENDED FOR THE CHEESE COURSE THE SIFTED SUGAR SHOULD BE OMITTED
lbi-2086-149214-0000 THE NARRATIVE IT MAY BE IS WOVEN OF SO HUMBLE A TEXTURE AS TO REQUIRE THIS ADVANTAGE AND AT THE SAME TIME TO RENDER IT THE MORE DIFFICULT OF ATTAINMENT
lbi-2086-149214-0001 IN GOOD FAITH HOWEVER HE IS NOT SUFFICIENTLY IMAGINATIVE TO FLATTER HIMSELF WITH THE SLIGHTEST HOPE OF THIS KIND
lbi-2086-149214-0002 THE AUTHOR HAS CONSIDERED IT HARDLY WORTH HIS WHILE THEREFORE RELENTLESSLY TO IMPALE THE STORY WITH ITS MORAL AS WITH AN IRON ROD OR RATHER AS BY STICKING A PIN THROUGH A BUTTERFLY THUS AT ONCE DEPRIVING IT OF LIFE AND CAUSING IT TO STIFFEN IN AN UNGAINLY AND UNNATURAL ATTITUDE
lbi-2086-149214-0003 IF PERMITTED BY THE HISTORICAL CONNECTION WHICH THOUGH SLIGHT WAS ESSENTIAL TO HIS PLAN THE AUTHOR WOULD VERY WILLINGLY HAVE AVOIDED ANYTHING OF THIS NATURE
lbi-2086-149214-0004 HE TRUSTS NOT TO BE CONSIDERED AS UNPARDONABLY OFFENDING BY LAYING OUT A STREET THAT INFRINGES UPON NOBODY'S PRIVATE RIGHTS AND APPROPRIATING A LOT OF LAND WHICH HAD NO VISIBLE OWNER AND BUILDING A HOUSE OF MATERIALS LONG IN USE FOR CONSTRUCTING CASTLES IN THE AIR
lbi-2086-149220-0000 THE ENCLOSURE HAD FORMERLY BEEN VERY EXTENSIVE BUT WAS NOW CONTRACTED WITHIN SMALL COMPASS AND HEMMED ABOUT PARTLY BY HIGH WOODEN FENCES AND PARTLY BY THE OUTBUILDINGS OF HOUSES THAT STOOD ON ANOTHER STREET
lbi-2086-149220-0001 THE WHITE DOUBLE ROSEBUSH HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN PROPPED UP ANEW AGAINST THE HOUSE SINCE THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE SEASON AND A PEAR TREE AND THREE DAMSON TREES WHICH EXCEPT A ROW OF CURRANT BUSHES CONSTITUTED THE ONLY VARIETIES OF FRUIT BORE MARKS OF THE RECENT AMPUTATION OF SEVERAL SUPERFLUOUS OR DEFECTIVE LIMBS
lbi-2086-149220-0002 THERE WERE ALSO A FEW SPECIES OF ANTIQUE AND HEREDITARY FLOWERS IN NO VERY FLOURISHING CONDITION BUT SCRUPULOUSLY WEEDED AS IF SOME PERSON EITHER OUT OF LOVE OR CURIOSITY HAD BEEN ANXIOUS TO BRING THEM TO SUCH PERFECTION AS THEY WERE CAPABLE OF ATTAINING
lbi-2086-149220-0003 SUMMER SQUASHES ALMOST IN THEIR GOLDEN BLOSSOM CUCUMBERS NOW EVINCING A TENDENCY TO SPREAD AWAY FROM THE MAIN STOCK AND RAMBLE FAR AND WIDE TWO OR THREE ROWS OF STRING BEANS AND AS MANY MORE THAT WERE ABOUT TO FESTOON THEMSELVES ON POLES TOMATOES OCCUPYING A SITE SO SHELTERED AND SUNNY THAT THE PLANTS WERE ALREADY GIGANTIC AND PROMISED AN EARLY AND ABUNDANT HARVEST
lbi-2086-149220-0004 PHOEBE WONDERED WHOSE CARE AND TOIL IT COULD HAVE BEEN THAT HAD PLANTED THESE VEGETABLES AND KEPT THE SOIL SO CLEAN AND ORDERLY
lbi-2086-149220-0005 BEES TOO STRANGE TO SAY HAD THOUGHT IT WORTH THEIR WHILE TO COME HITHER POSSIBLY FROM THE RANGE OF HIVES BESIDE SOME FARM HOUSE MILES AWAY
lbi-2086-149220-0006 THIS WAS A FOUNTAIN SET ROUND WITH A RIM OF OLD MOSSY STONES AND PAVED IN ITS BED WITH WHAT APPEARED TO BE A SORT OF MOSAIC WORK OF VARIOUSLY COLORED PEBBLES
lbi-2086-149220-0007 IT NOW CONTAINED ONLY CHANTICLEER HIS TWO WIVES AND A SOLITARY CHICKEN
lbi-2086-149220-0008 IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE RACE HAD DEGENERATED LIKE MANY A NOBLE RACE BESIDES IN CONSEQUENCE OF TOO STRICT A WATCHFULNESS TO KEEP IT PURE
lbi-2086-149220-0009 THESE FEATHERED PEOPLE HAD EXISTED TOO LONG IN THEIR DISTINCT VARIETY A FACT OF WHICH THE PRESENT REPRESENTATIVES JUDGING BY THEIR LUGUBRIOUS DEPORTMENT SEEMED TO BE AWARE
lbi-2086-149220-0010 THEY KEPT THEMSELVES ALIVE UNQUESTIONABLY AND LAID NOW AND THEN AN EGG AND HATCHED A CHICKEN NOT FOR ANY PLEASURE OF THEIR OWN BUT THAT THE WORLD MIGHT NOT ABSOLUTELY LOSE WHAT HAD ONCE BEEN SO ADMIRABLE A BREED OF FOWLS
lbi-2086-149220-0011 THE DISTINGUISHING MARK OF THE HENS WAS A CREST OF LAMENTABLY SCANTY GROWTH IN THESE LATTER DAYS BUT SO ODDLY AND WICKEDLY ANALOGOUS TO HEPZIBAH'S TURBAN THAT PHOEBE TO THE POIGNANT DISTRESS OF HER CONSCIENCE BUT INEVITABLY WAS LED TO FANCY A GENERAL RESEMBLANCE BETWIXT THESE FORLORN BIPEDS AND HER RESPECTABLE RELATIVE
lbi-2086-149220-0012 THE CHICKEN CREPT THROUGH THE PALES OF THE COOP AND RAN WITH SOME SHOW OF LIVELINESS TO HER FEET WHILE CHANTICLEER AND THE LADIES OF HIS HOUSEHOLD REGARDED HER WITH QUEER SIDELONG GLANCES AND THEN CROAKED ONE TO ANOTHER AS IF COMMUNICATING THEIR SAGE OPINIONS OF HER CHARACTER
lbi-2086-149220-0013 SO WISE AS WELL AS ANTIQUE WAS THEIR ASPECT AS TO GIVE COLOR TO THE IDEA NOT MERELY THAT THEY WERE THE DESCENDANTS OF A TIME HONORED RACE BUT THAT THEY HAD EXISTED IN THEIR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY EVER SINCE THE HOUSE OF THE SEVEN GABLES WAS FOUNDED AND WERE SOMEHOW MIXED UP WITH ITS DESTINY
lbi-2086-149220-0014 HE HELD A HOE IN HIS HAND AND WHILE PHOEBE WAS GONE IN QUEST OF THE CRUMBS HAD BEGUN TO BUSY HIMSELF WITH DRAWING UP FRESH EARTH ABOUT THE ROOTS OF THE TOMATOES
lbi-2086-149220-0015 THEY HAVE KNOWN ME MUCH LONGER BUT NEVER HONOR ME WITH ANY FAMILIARITY THOUGH HARDLY A DAY PASSES WITHOUT MY BRINGING THEM FOOD
lbi-2086-149220-0016 MISS HEPZIBAH I SUPPOSE WILL INTERWEAVE THE FACT WITH HER OTHER TRADITIONS AND SET IT DOWN THAT THE FOWLS KNOW YOU TO BE A PYNCHEON
lbi-2086-149220-0017 AH BUT THESE HENS ANSWERED THE YOUNG MAN THESE HENS OF ARISTOCRATIC LINEAGE WOULD SCORN TO UNDERSTAND THE VULGAR LANGUAGE OF A BARN YARD FOWL
lbi-2086-149220-0018 I PREFER TO THINK AND SO WOULD MISS HEPZIBAH THAT THEY RECOGNIZE THE FAMILY TONE FOR YOU ARE A PYNCHEON
lbi-2086-149220-0019 MY NAME IS PHOEBE PYNCHEON SAID THE GIRL WITH A MANNER OF SOME RESERVE FOR SHE WAS AWARE THAT HER NEW ACQUAINTANCE COULD BE NO OTHER THAN THE DAGUERREOTYPIST OF WHOSE LAWLESS PROPENSITIES THE OLD MAID HAD GIVEN HER A DISAGREEABLE IDEA
lbi-2086-149220-0020 I TURN UP THE EARTH BY WAY OF PASTIME
lbi-2086-149220-0021 IT IS LIKE A BANDAGE OVER ONE'S EYES TO COME INTO IT
lbi-2086-149220-0022 IF YOU WOULD PERMIT ME SAID THE ARTIST LOOKING AT PHOEBE I SHOULD LIKE TO TRY WHETHER THE DAGUERREOTYPE CAN BRING OUT DISAGREEABLE TRAITS ON A PERFECTLY AMIABLE FACE
lbi-2086-149220-0023 MOST OF MY LIKENESSES DO LOOK UNAMIABLE BUT THE VERY SUFFICIENT REASON I FANCY IS BECAUSE THE ORIGINALS ARE SO
lbi-2086-149220-0024 THERE IS A WONDERFUL INSIGHT IN HEAVEN'S BROAD AND SIMPLE SUNSHINE
lbi-2086-149220-0025 WHILE WE GIVE IT CREDIT ONLY FOR DEPICTING THE MEREST SURFACE IT ACTUALLY BRINGS OUT THE SECRET CHARACTER WITH A TRUTH THAT NO PAINTER WOULD EVER VENTURE UPON EVEN COULD HE DETECT IT
lbi-2086-149220-0026 YET THE ORIGINAL WEARS TO COMMON EYES A VERY DIFFERENT EXPRESSION
lbi-2086-149220-0027 HE EXHIBITED A DAGUERREOTYPE MINIATURE IN A MOROCCO CASE
lbi-2086-149220-0028 PHOEBE MERELY GLANCED AT IT AND GAVE IT BACK
lbi-2086-149220-0029 I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT THIS IS A MODERN FACE AND ONE WHICH YOU WILL VERY PROBABLY MEET
lbi-2086-149220-0030 THE SUN AS YOU SEE TELLS QUITE ANOTHER STORY AND WILL NOT BE COAXED OUT OF IT AFTER HALF A DOZEN PATIENT ATTEMPTS ON MY PART
lbi-2086-149220-0031 HERE WE HAVE THE MAN SLY SUBTLE HARD IMPERIOUS AND WITHAL COLD AS ICE LOOK AT THAT EYE
lbi-2086-149220-0032 AND YET IF YOU COULD ONLY SEE THE BENIGN SMILE OF THE ORIGINAL
lbi-2086-149220-0033 WELL I DON'T WISH TO SEE IT ANY MORE OBSERVED PHOEBE TURNING AWAY HER EYES IT IS CERTAINLY VERY LIKE THE OLD PORTRAIT
lbi-2086-149220-0034 IF THE ORIGINAL IS STILL IN THE WORLD I THINK HE MIGHT DEFY THE SUN TO MAKE HIM LOOK STERN AND HARD
lbi-2086-149220-0035 IS THERE NOTHING WILD IN THE EYE CONTINUED HOLGRAVE SO EARNESTLY THAT IT EMBARRASSED PHOEBE AS DID ALSO THE QUIET FREEDOM WITH WHICH HE PRESUMED ON THEIR SO RECENT ACQUAINTANCE
lbi-2086-149220-0036 IT IS NONSENSE SAID PHOEBE A LITTLE IMPATIENTLY FOR US TO TALK ABOUT A PICTURE WHICH YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN
lbi-2086-149220-0037 SINCE YOU ARE A FRIEND OF MY COUSIN HEPZIBAH'S YOU SHOULD ASK HER TO SHOW YOU THE PICTURE
lbi-2086-149220-0038 SO WE WILL BE FELLOW LABORERS SOMEWHAT ON THE COMMUNITY SYSTEM
lbi-2086-149220-0039 SHE DID NOT ALTOGETHER LIKE HIM
lbi-2086-149220-0040 OH REJOINED THE DAGUERREOTYPIST BECAUSE LIKE AN OLD LADY'S CUP OF TEA IT IS WATER BEWITCHED
lbi-2086-149220-0041 SHE WAS INDISTINCTLY AWARE HOWEVER THAT THE GAUNT FIGURE OF THE OLD GENTLEWOMAN WAS SITTING IN ONE OF THE STRAIGHT BACKED CHAIRS A LITTLE WITHDRAWN FROM THE WINDOW THE FAINT GLEAM OF WHICH SHOWED THE BLANCHED PALENESS OF HER CHEEK TURNED SIDEWAYS TOWARDS A CORNER
lbi-2086-149220-0042 BUT PUT IT ON THE TABLE IN THE CORNER OF THE PASSAGE
lbi-2086-149220-0043 WHAT AN INSTRUMENT IS THE HUMAN VOICE
lbi-2086-149220-0044 HOW WONDERFULLY RESPONSIVE TO EVERY EMOTION OF THE HUMAN SOUL
lbi-2086-149220-0045 FEWER WORDS THAN BEFORE BUT WITH THE SAME MYSTERIOUS MUSIC IN THEM
lbi-2086-149220-0046 PRAY GO TO BED FOR I AM SURE YOU MUST NEED REST
lbi-2086-149220-0047 I WILL SIT IN THE PARLOR AWHILE AND COLLECT MY THOUGHTS
lbi-2086-149220-0048 WHILE THUS DISMISSING HER THE MAIDEN LADY STEPT FORWARD KISSED PHOEBE AND PRESSED HER TO HER HEART WHICH BEAT AGAINST THE GIRL'S BOSOM WITH A STRONG HIGH AND TUMULTUOUS SWELL
lbi-2086-149220-0049 AT SOME UNCERTAIN PERIOD IN THE DEPTHS OF NIGHT AND AS IT WERE THROUGH THE THIN VEIL OF A DREAM SHE WAS CONSCIOUS OF A FOOTSTEP MOUNTING THE STAIRS HEAVILY BUT NOT WITH FORCE AND DECISION
lbi-2277-149874-0000 MINNIE'S FLAT AS THE ONE FLOOR RESIDENT APARTMENTS WERE THEN BEING CALLED WAS IN A PART OF WEST VAN BUREN STREET INHABITED BY FAMILIES OF LABOURERS AND CLERKS MEN WHO HAD COME AND WERE STILL COMING WITH THE RUSH OF POPULATION POURING IN AT THE RATE OF FIFTY THOUSAND A YEAR
lbi-2277-149874-0001 TO CARRIE THE SOUND OF THE LITTLE BELLS UPON THE HORSE CARS AS THEY TINKLED IN AND OUT OF HEARING WAS AS PLEASING AS IT WAS NOVEL
lbi-2277-149874-0002 TO HIM THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF HIS WIFE'S SISTER WAS A MATTER OF INDIFFERENCE
lbi-2277-149874-0003 HE WAS OF A CLEAN SAVING DISPOSITION AND HAD ALREADY PAID A NUMBER OF MONTHLY INSTALMENTS ON TWO LOTS FAR OUT ON THE WEST SIDE
lbi-2277-149874-0004 HIS AMBITION WAS SOME DAY TO BUILD A HOUSE ON THEM
lbi-2277-149874-0005 SHE HAD SOME SLIGHT GIFT OF OBSERVATION AND THAT SENSE SO RICH IN EVERY WOMAN INTUITION
lbi-2277-149874-0006 THE WALLS OF THE ROOMS WERE DISCORDANTLY PAPERED
lbi-2277-149874-0007 THE FLOORS WERE COVERED WITH MATTING AND THE HALL LAID WITH A THIN RAG CARPET
lbi-2277-149874-0008 THEN SHE WALKED AND SANG TO IT UNTIL HANSON DISTURBED IN HIS READING CAME AND TOOK IT
lbi-2277-149874-0009 ONE COULD SEE THAT HE WAS VERY MUCH WRAPPED UP IN HIS OFFSPRING
lbi-2277-149874-0010 NOW NOW HE SAID WALKING THERE THERE AND THERE WAS A CERTAIN SWEDISH ACCENT NOTICEABLE IN HIS VOICE
lbi-2277-149874-0011 HE SEEMED TO BE THINKING OF SOMETHING ELSE
lbi-2277-149874-0012 MINNIE BEGAN TO EXPLAIN BUT HER HUSBAND TOOK THIS PART OF THE CONVERSATION TO HIMSELF
lbi-2277-149874-0013 YOU COULD GET HOME EASY TOO IT ISN'T VERY FAR
lbi-2277-149874-0014 SHE ASKED MINNIE FOR INK AND PAPER WHICH WERE UPON THE MANTEL IN THE DINING ROOM AND WHEN THE LATTER HAD GONE TO BED AT TEN GOT OUT DROUET'S CARD AND WROTE HIM
lbi-2277-149874-0015 SHE WANTED TO MAKE SOME REFERENCE TO THEIR RELATIONS UPON THE TRAIN BUT WAS TOO TIMID
lbi-2277-149874-0016 ANYTHING WAS GOOD ENOUGH SO LONG AS IT PAID SAY FIVE DOLLARS A WEEK TO BEGIN WITH
lbi-2277-149874-0017 A SHOP GIRL WAS THE DESTINY PREFIGURED FOR THE NEWCOMER
lbi-2277-149874-0018 IT WAS UNDER SUCH AUSPICIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES THAT SHE STARTED OUT THIS MORNING TO LOOK FOR WORK
lbi-2277-149874-0019 NARROW BOARD WALKS EXTENDED OUT PASSING HERE A HOUSE AND THERE A STORE AT FAR INTERVALS EVENTUALLY ENDING ON THE OPEN PRAIRIE
lbi-2277-149874-0020 IT GAVE AN IMPOSING APPEARANCE TO MOST OF THE WHOLESALE HOUSES WHOSE OFFICES WERE UPON THE GROUND FLOOR AND IN PLAIN VIEW OF THE STREET
lbi-2277-149874-0021 THESE VAST BUILDINGS WHAT WERE THEY
lbi-2277-149896-0000 HE WAS IN A FEVERED STATE OF MIND OWING TO THE BLIGHT HIS WIFE'S ACTION THREATENED TO CAST UPON HIS ENTIRE FUTURE
lbi-2277-149896-0001 HE WOULD HAVE TO PAY HER THE MONEY WHICH SHE WOULD NOW REGULARLY DEMAND OR THERE WOULD BE TROUBLE IT DID NOT MATTER WHAT HE DID
lbi-2277-149896-0002 HURSTWOOD WALKED THE FLOOR MENTALLY ARRANGING THE CHIEF POINTS OF HIS SITUATION
lbi-2277-149896-0003 HE ALSO THOUGHT OF HIS MANAGERIAL POSITION
lbi-2277-149896-0004 HOW WOULD THE PAPERS TALK ABOUT IT
lbi-2277-149896-0005 MANY LITTLE WRINKLES GATHERED BETWEEN HIS EYES AS HE CONTEMPLATED THIS AND HIS BROW MOISTENED
lbi-2277-149896-0006 HE COULD ARRANGE THAT SATISFACTORILY FOR CARRIE WOULD BE GLAD TO WAIT IF NECESSARY
lbi-2277-149896-0007 HE WOULD SEE HOW THINGS TURNED OUT TO MORROW AND THEN HE WOULD TALK TO HER THEY WERE GOING TO MEET AS USUAL
lbi-2277-149896-0008 FOR SOME REASON HE FELT AS IF SOMETHING MIGHT COME THAT WAY AND WAS RELIEVED WHEN ALL THE ENVELOPES HAD BEEN SCANNED AND NOTHING SUSPICIOUS NOTICED
lbi-2277-149896-0009 WHILE THE DANGER HAD NOT LESSENED IT HAD NOT AS YET MATERIALISED AND WITH HIM NO NEWS WAS GOOD NEWS
lbi-2277-149896-0010 SO LITTLE DID HE CONSIDER DROUET THAT IT NEVER ONCE OCCURRED TO HIM TO WORRY ABOUT HIS FINDING OUT
lbi-2277-149896-0011 HE GREW RESTLESS AS HE RUMINATED AND THEN DECIDED THAT PERHAPS IT WAS NOTHING
lbi-2277-149896-0012 SHE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET AWAY THIS MORNING
lbi-2277-149896-0013 HE WOULD GET ONE TO DAY IT WOULD PROBABLY BE ON HIS DESK WHEN HE GOT BACK HE WOULD LOOK FOR IT AT ONCE
lbi-2277-149896-0014 AFTER A TIME HE GAVE UP WAITING AND DREARILY HEADED FOR THE MADISON CAR
lbi-2277-149896-0015 HE WENT IN AND EXAMINED HIS LETTERS BUT THERE WAS NOTHING FROM CARRIE
lbi-2277-149896-0016 FORTUNATELY THERE WAS NOTHING FROM HIS WIFE EITHER
lbi-2277-149896-0017 AT ONE THIRTY HE WENT TO RECTOR'S FOR LUNCH AND WHEN HE RETURNED A MESSENGER WAS WAITING FOR HIM
lbi-2277-149896-0018 HIS FIRST IMPULSE WAS TO WRITE BUT FOUR WORDS IN REPLY GO TO THE DEVIL
lbi-2277-149896-0019 BUT HE COMPROMISED BY TELLING THE BOY THAT THERE WOULD BE NO REPLY
lbi-2277-149896-0020 THEN HE SAT DOWN IN HIS CHAIR AND GAZED WITHOUT SEEING CONTEMPLATING THE RESULT OF HIS WORK
lbi-2277-149896-0021 WHAT WOULD SHE DO ABOUT THAT THE CONFOUNDED WRETCH
lbi-2277-149896-0022 LATER HOWEVER HIS OLD DISCRETION ASSERTED ITSELF
lbi-2277-149896-0023 SOMETHING HAD TO BE DONE A CLIMAX WAS NEAR AND SHE WOULD NOT SIT IDLE
lbi-2277-149896-0024 HE KNEW HER WELL ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT WHEN SHE HAD DECIDED UPON A PLAN SHE WOULD FOLLOW IT UP
lbi-2277-149896-0025 HE AROSE FROM HIS CHAIR AND WENT AND LOOKED OUT INTO THE STREET
lbi-2277-149896-0026 THE LONG DRIZZLE HAD BEGUN PEDESTRIANS HAD TURNED UP COLLARS AND TROUSERS AT THE BOTTOM
lbi-2277-149896-0027 HURSTWOOD ALMOST EXCLAIMED OUT LOUD AT THE INSISTENCY OF THIS THING
lbi-2277-149896-0028 HE PUT ON HIS HAT AND LOOKED AROUND FOR HIS UMBRELLA
lbi-2277-149896-0029 HE WOULD HAVE SOME ARRANGEMENT OF THIS THING
lbi-2277-149896-0030 HE BEGAN TO WISH THAT HE HAD COMPROMISED IN SOME WAY OR OTHER THAT HE HAD SENT THE MONEY PERHAPS HE COULD DO IT UP HERE
lbi-2277-149896-0031 HE WOULD GO IN AND SEE ANYHOW HE WOULD HAVE NO ROW
lbi-2277-149896-0032 BY THE TIME HE REACHED HIS OWN STREET HE WAS KEENLY ALIVE TO THE DIFFICULTIES OF HIS SITUATION AND WISHED OVER AND OVER THAT SOME SOLUTION WOULD OFFER ITSELF THAT HE COULD SEE HIS WAY OUT
lbi-2277-149896-0033 THEN HE RANG THE BELL NO ANSWER
lbi-2277-149896-0034 HE RANG AGAIN THIS TIME HARDER STILL NO ANSWER
lbi-2277-149897-0000 WHEN HURSTWOOD GOT BACK TO HIS OFFICE AGAIN HE WAS IN A GREATER QUANDARY THAN EVER
lbi-2277-149897-0001 HE COULD HARDLY REALISE HOW IT HAD ALL COME ABOUT
lbi-2277-149897-0002 NO LETTER HAD COME NO WORD OF ANY KIND AND YET HERE IT WAS LATE IN THE EVENING AND SHE HAD AGREED TO MEET HIM THAT MORNING
lbi-2277-149897-0003 HE SAW THAT IN THE EXCITEMENT OF RECENT EVENTS HE HAD NOT FORMULATED A PLAN UPON THAT SCORE
lbi-2277-149897-0004 HE WAS GETTING SOME VAGUE COMFORT OUT OF A GOOD CIGAR BUT IT WAS NO PANACEA FOR THE ILL WHICH AFFECTED HIM
lbi-2277-149897-0005 IT WAS WITH GREAT OPPOSITION AFTER TWO OR THREE HOURS OF THE MOST URGENT MENTAL AFFIRMATION AND DENIAL THAT AT LAST HE GOT AN ENVELOPE PLACED IN IT THE REQUESTED AMOUNT AND SLOWLY SEALED IT UP
lbi-2277-149897-0006 THEN HE CALLED HARRY THE BOY OF ALL WORK AROUND THE PLACE
lbi-2277-149897-0007 YOU TAKE THIS TO THIS ADDRESS HE SAID HANDING HIM THE ENVELOPE AND GIVE IT TO MISSUS HURSTWOOD YES SIR SAID THE BOY
lbi-2277-149897-0008 ANY ANSWER I GUESS NOT
lbi-2277-149897-0009 THE BOY HASTENED AWAY AND THE MANAGER FELL TO HIS MUSINGS
lbi-2277-149897-0010 HE WAS BEATEN FOR TO NIGHT AND HE MIGHT JUST AS WELL MAKE THE BEST OF IT
lbi-2277-149897-0011 SHE WOULD TAKE THE ENVELOPE AND KNOW THAT SHE HAD TRIUMPHED
lbi-2277-149897-0012 IF HE ONLY HAD THAT LETTER BACK HE WOULDN'T SEND IT
lbi-2277-149897-0013 FOR RELIEF HE AROSE AND JOINED IN CONVERSATION WITH A FEW FRIENDS WHO WERE DRINKING
lbi-2277-149897-0014 ALL THE TIME HIS THOUGHTS WOULD RUN OUT TO HIS HOME AND SEE THE SCENE BEING THEREIN ENACTED
lbi-2277-149897-0015 IN ABOUT AN HOUR AND THREE QUARTERS THE BOY RETURNED
lbi-2277-149897-0016 HE FANCIED AS HE SAT AT HIS DESK THAT NOTHING WOULD BE DONE FOR A WEEK OR TWO MEANWHILE HE WOULD HAVE TIME TO THINK
lbi-2277-149897-0017 HOW ABOUT THAT NOW HIS PAIN AT HER FAILURE TO MEET OR WRITE HIM RAPIDLY INCREASED AS HE DEVOTED HIMSELF TO THIS SUBJECT
lbi-2277-149897-0018 HE DECIDED TO WRITE HER CARE OF THE WEST SIDE POST OFFICE AND ASK FOR AN EXPLANATION AS WELL AS TO HAVE HER MEET HIM
lbi-2277-149897-0019 THREE O'CLOCK CAME FOUR FIVE SIX AND NO LETTER
lbi-2277-149897-0020 THE HELPLESS MANAGER PACED THE FLOOR AND GRIMLY ENDURED THE GLOOM OF DEFEAT
lbi-2277-149897-0021 HE SAW A BUSY SATURDAY USHERED OUT THE SABBATH IN AND NOTHING DONE
lbi-2277-149897-0022 ALL DAY THE BAR BEING CLOSED HE BROODED ALONE SHUT OUT FROM HOME FROM THE EXCITEMENT OF HIS RESORT FROM CARRIE AND WITHOUT THE ABILITY TO ALTER HIS CONDITION ONE IOTA
lbi-2277-149897-0023 IT WAS THE WORST SUNDAY HE HAD SPENT IN HIS LIFE
lbi-2277-149897-0024 IT SEEMED AS IF HIS FAMILY TROUBLES WERE JUST BEGINNING
lbi-2277-149897-0025 HE WAS QUITE CERTAIN NOW THAT SHE KNEW HE WAS MARRIED AND WAS ANGERED AT HIS PERFIDY
lbi-2277-149897-0026 HE HAD LOVED HER EARNESTLY ENOUGH BUT NOW THAT THE POSSIBILITY OF LOSING HER STARED HIM IN THE FACE SHE SEEMED MUCH MORE ATTRACTIVE
lbi-2277-149897-0027 HE WOULD GO TO HER AND TELL HER ALL HIS FAMILY COMPLICATIONS
lbi-2277-149897-0028 HE WOULD EXPLAIN TO HER JUST WHERE HE STOOD AND HOW MUCH HE NEEDED HER
lbi-2277-149897-0029 HE DID MANAGE TO BRING HIMSELF INTO THE MOOD TO GO OUT TO CARRIE BUT WHEN HE GOT IN OGDEN PLACE HE THOUGHT HE SAW A MAN WATCHING HIM AND WENT AWAY
lbi-2277-149897-0030 HE DID NOT GO WITHIN A BLOCK OF THE HOUSE
lbi-2277-149897-0031 HE TROUBLED OVER MANY LITTLE DETAILS AND TALKED PERFUNCTORILY TO EVERYBODY
lbi-2277-149897-0032 HE STAYED AT HIS DESK LONG AFTER ALL OTHERS HAD GONE AND ONLY QUITTED IT WHEN THE NIGHT WATCHMAN ON HIS ROUND PULLED AT THE FRONT DOOR TO SEE IF IT WAS SAFELY LOCKED
lbi-2277-149897-0033 ON WEDNESDAY HE RECEIVED ANOTHER POLITE NOTE FROM MC GREGOR JAMES AND HAY IT READ
lbi-2277-149897-0034 DEAR SIR WE BEG TO INFORM YOU THAT WE ARE INSTRUCTED TO WAIT UNTIL TO MORROW THURSDAY AT ONE O'CLOCK BEFORE FILING SUIT AGAINST YOU ON BEHALF OF MISSUS JULIA HURSTWOOD FOR DIVORCE AND ALIMONY
lbi-2277-149897-0035 VERY TRULY YOURS ET CETERA COMPROMISE
lbi-2277-149897-0036 SO HERE IT WAS SPREAD OUT CLEAR BEFORE HIM AND NOW HE KNEW WHAT TO EXPECT
lbi-2277-149897-0037 IF HE DIDN'T GO AND SEE THEM THEY WOULD SUE HIM PROMPTLY
lbi-2412-153947-0000 PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION
lbi-2412-153947-0001 THIS IS A MISTAKE THOUGH A PERFECTLY NATURAL ONE
lbi-2412-153947-0002 ON MY RETURN I PURPOSELY AVOIDED LOOKING INTO IT UNTIL I HAD SENT BACK MY LAST REVISES TO THE PRINTER
lbi-2412-153947-0003 THEN I HAD MUCH PLEASURE IN READING IT BUT WAS INDEED SURPRISED AT THE MANY LITTLE POINTS OF SIMILARITY BETWEEN THE TWO BOOKS IN SPITE OF THEIR ENTIRE INDEPENDENCE TO ONE ANOTHER
lbi-2412-153947-0004 I REGRET THAT REVIEWERS HAVE IN SOME CASES BEEN INCLINED TO TREAT THE CHAPTERS ON MACHINES AS AN ATTEMPT TO REDUCE MISTER DARWIN'S THEORY TO AN ABSURDITY
lbi-2412-153947-0005 I AM SURPRISED HOWEVER THAT THE BOOK AT WHICH SUCH AN EXAMPLE OF THE SPECIOUS MISUSE OF ANALOGY WOULD SEEM MOST NATURALLY LEVELLED SHOULD HAVE OCCURRED TO NO REVIEWER NEITHER SHALL I MENTION THE NAME OF THE BOOK HERE THOUGH I SHOULD FANCY THAT THE HINT GIVEN WILL SUFFICE
lbi-2412-153947-0006 BUT THIS HAD AN EFFECT OF WHICH I HAVE LITTLE REASON TO COMPLAIN FOR I WAS ALLOWED ALMOST TO CALL THEM LIFE LONG SELF DECEIVERS TO THEIR FACES AND THEY SAID IT WAS QUITE TRUE BUT THAT IT DID NOT MATTER
lbi-2412-153947-0007 I MUST NOT CONCLUDE WITHOUT EXPRESSING MY MOST SINCERE THANKS TO MY CRITICS AND TO THE PUBLIC FOR THE LENIENCY AND CONSIDERATION WITH WHICH THEY HAVE TREATED MY ADVENTURES
lbi-2412-153947-0008 IT WAS WRITTEN IN THE UPPER RANGITATA DISTRICT OF THE CANTERBURY PROVINCE AS IT THEN WAS OF NEW ZEALAND AND APPEARED AT CHRISTCHURCH IN THE PRESS NEWSPAPER JUNE THIRTEENTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE
lbi-2412-153947-0009 I ALSO WROTE ABOUT THIS TIME THE SUBSTANCE OF WHAT ULTIMATELY BECAME THE MUSICAL BANKS AND THE TRIAL OF A MAN FOR BEING IN A CONSUMPTION
lbi-2412-153947-0010 I SEE FROM MY SECOND PREFACE THAT I TOOK THE BOOK TO MESSRS CHAPMAN AND HALL MAY FIRST EIGHTEEN SEVENTY ONE AND ON THEIR REJECTION OF IT UNDER THE ADVICE OF ONE WHO HAS ATTAINED THE HIGHEST RANK AMONG LIVING WRITERS I LET IT SLEEP TILL I TOOK IT TO MISTER TRUBNER EARLY IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO
lbi-2412-153947-0011 I ATTRIBUTE ITS UNLOOKED FOR SUCCESS MAINLY TO TWO EARLY FAVOURABLE REVIEWS THE FIRST IN THE PALL MALL GAZETTE OF APRIL TWELFTH AND THE SECOND IN THE SPECTATOR OF APRIL TWENTIETH
lbi-2412-153947-0012 THERE WAS ALSO ANOTHER CAUSE
lbi-2412-153947-0013 THE FIRST EDITION OF EREWHON SOLD IN ABOUT THREE WEEKS I HAD NOT TAKEN MOULDS AND AS THE DEMAND WAS STRONG IT WAS SET UP AGAIN IMMEDIATELY
lbi-2412-153947-0014 I MADE A FEW FURTHER VERY TRIFLING ALTERATIONS BEFORE MOULDS WERE TAKEN BUT SINCE THE SUMMER OF EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO AS NEW EDITIONS WERE FROM TIME TO TIME WANTED THEY HAVE BEEN PRINTED FROM STEREOS THEN MADE
lbi-2412-153947-0015 I AM STILL FAIRLY WELL SATISFIED WITH THOSE PARTS OF EREWHON THAT WERE REPEATEDLY REWRITTEN BUT FROM THOSE THAT HAD ONLY A SINGLE WRITING I WOULD GLADLY CUT OUT SOME FORTY OR FIFTY PAGES IF I COULD
lbi-2412-153947-0016 THIS HOWEVER MAY NOT BE FOR THE COPYRIGHT WILL PROBABLY EXPIRE IN A LITTLE OVER TWELVE YEARS
lbi-2412-153948-0000 IF THE READER WILL EXCUSE ME I WILL SAY NOTHING OF MY ANTECEDENTS NOR OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH LED ME TO LEAVE MY NATIVE COUNTRY THE NARRATIVE WOULD BE TEDIOUS TO HIM AND PAINFUL TO MYSELF
lbi-2412-153948-0001 IT WILL BE SEEN THAT I DID NOT SUCCEED IN MY DESIGN AND THAT HOWEVER MUCH I MAY HAVE MET WITH THAT WAS NEW AND STRANGE I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO REAP ANY PECUNIARY ADVANTAGE
lbi-2412-153948-0002 NO ONE WHO IS HIMSELF HONEST WILL DOUBT MY BEING SO
lbi-2412-153948-0003 I REACHED MY DESTINATION IN ONE OF THE LAST MONTHS OF EIGHTEEN SIXTY EIGHT BUT I DARE NOT MENTION THE SEASON LEST THE READER SHOULD GATHER IN WHICH HEMISPHERE I WAS
lbi-2412-153948-0004 SHEEP AND CATTLE WERE INTRODUCED AND BRED WITH EXTREME RAPIDITY MEN TOOK UP THEIR FIFTY THOUSAND OR ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES OF COUNTRY GOING INLAND ONE BEHIND THE OTHER TILL IN A FEW YEARS THERE WAS NOT AN ACRE BETWEEN THE SEA AND THE FRONT RANGES WHICH WAS NOT TAKEN UP AND STATIONS EITHER FOR SHEEP OR CATTLE WERE SPOTTED ABOUT AT INTERVALS OF SOME TWENTY OR THIRTY MILES OVER THE WHOLE COUNTRY
lbi-2412-153948-0005 I WAS DELIGHTED WITH THE COUNTRY AND THE MANNER OF LIFE
lbi-2412-153948-0006 I WAS TO SEE THE SHEEP NOT NECESSARILY CLOSE AT HAND NOR TO GET THEM IN A SINGLE MOB BUT TO SEE ENOUGH OF THEM HERE AND THERE TO FEEL EASY THAT NOTHING HAD GONE WRONG THIS WAS NO DIFFICULT MATTER FOR THERE WERE NOT ABOVE EIGHT HUNDRED OF THEM AND BEING ALL BREEDING EWES THEY WERE PRETTY QUIET
lbi-2412-153948-0007 THERE WERE A GOOD MANY SHEEP WHICH I KNEW AS TWO OR THREE BLACK EWES AND A BLACK LAMB OR TWO AND SEVERAL OTHERS WHICH HAD SOME DISTINGUISHING MARK WHEREBY I COULD TELL THEM
lbi-2412-153948-0008 IT IS SURPRISING HOW SOON THE EYE BECOMES ACCUSTOMED TO MISSING TWENTY SHEEP OUT OF TWO OR THREE HUNDRED
lbi-2412-153948-0009 IT WAS A MONOTONOUS LIFE BUT IT WAS VERY HEALTHY AND ONE DOES NOT MUCH MIND ANYTHING WHEN ONE IS WELL
lbi-2412-153948-0010 THE COUNTRY WAS THE GRANDEST THAT CAN BE IMAGINED
lbi-2412-153948-0011 SO LONELY AND SO SOLEMN WITH THE SAD GREY CLOUDS ABOVE AND NO SOUND SAVE A LOST LAMB BLEATING UPON THE MOUNTAIN SIDE AS THOUGH ITS LITTLE HEART WERE BREAKING
lbi-2412-153948-0012 EACH MUST CRY LOUDER AND WANDER FARTHER YET MAY LUCK BE WITH THEM BOTH THAT THEY MAY FIND THEIR OWN AT NIGHTFALL
lbi-2412-153948-0013 I HAD NO MONEY BUT IF I COULD ONLY FIND WORKABLE COUNTRY I MIGHT STOCK IT WITH BORROWED CAPITAL AND CONSIDER MYSELF A MADE MAN
lbi-2412-153948-0014 THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE WHOLE WORLD WHO HAD THE SMALLEST IDEA SAVE THOSE WHO WERE THEMSELVES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT IF INDEED THERE WAS ANY ONE AT ALL COULD I HOPE TO CROSS IT
lbi-2412-153948-0015 I WOULD TRY THE NEARER RANGE AND SEE HOW FAR I COULD GO
lbi-2412-153954-0000 SHORTLY AFTER PASSING ONE OF THESE CHAPELS WE CAME SUDDENLY UPON A VILLAGE WHICH STARTED UP OUT OF THE MIST AND I WAS ALARMED LEST I SHOULD BE MADE AN OBJECT OF CURIOSITY OR DISLIKE
lbi-2412-153954-0001 MY GUIDES HOWEVER WERE WELL KNOWN AND THE NATURAL POLITENESS OF THE PEOPLE PREVENTED THEM FROM PUTTING ME TO ANY INCONVENIENCE BUT THEY COULD NOT HELP EYEING ME NOR I THEM
lbi-2412-153954-0002 THE STREETS WERE NARROW AND UNPAVED BUT VERY FAIRLY CLEAN
lbi-2412-153954-0003 THE VINE GREW OUTSIDE MANY OF THE HOUSES AND THERE WERE SOME WITH SIGN BOARDS ON WHICH WAS PAINTED A BOTTLE AND A GLASS THAT MADE ME FEEL MUCH AT HOME
lbi-2412-153954-0004 EVEN ON THIS LEDGE OF HUMAN SOCIETY THERE WAS A STUNTED GROWTH OF SHOPLETS WHICH HAD TAKEN ROOT AND VEGETATED SOMEHOW THOUGH AS IN AN AIR MERCANTILE OF THE BLEAKEST
lbi-2412-153954-0005 EACH FEATURE WAS FINISHED EYELIDS EYELASHES AND EARS BEING ALMOST INVARIABLY PERFECT
lbi-2412-153954-0006 THEIR EXPRESSION WAS DIVINE AND AS THEY GLANCED AT ME TIMIDLY BUT WITH PARTED LIPS IN GREAT BEWILDERMENT I FORGOT ALL THOUGHTS OF THEIR CONVERSION IN FEELINGS THAT WERE FAR MORE EARTHLY
lbi-2412-153954-0007 EVEN IN MIDDLE AGE THEY WERE STILL COMELY AND THE OLD GREY HAIRED WOMEN AT THEIR COTTAGE DOORS HAD A DIGNITY NOT TO SAY MAJESTY OF THEIR OWN
lbi-2412-153954-0008 THE MEN WERE AS HANDSOME AS THE WOMEN BEAUTIFUL
lbi-2412-153954-0009 I HAVE ALWAYS DELIGHTED IN AND REVERENCED BEAUTY BUT I FELT SIMPLY ABASHED IN THE PRESENCE OF SUCH A SPLENDID TYPE A COMPOUND OF ALL THAT IS BEST IN EGYPTIAN GREEK AND ITALIAN
lbi-2412-153954-0010 THE CHILDREN WERE INFINITE IN NUMBER AND EXCEEDINGLY MERRY I NEED HARDLY SAY THAT THEY CAME IN FOR THEIR FULL SHARE OF THE PREVAILING BEAUTY
lbi-2412-153954-0011 I EXPRESSED BY SIGNS MY ADMIRATION AND PLEASURE TO MY GUIDES AND THEY WERE GREATLY PLEASED
lbi-2412-153954-0012 THE COUNTRY WAS HIGHLY CULTIVATED EVERY LEDGE BEING PLANTED WITH CHESTNUTS WALNUTS AND APPLE TREES FROM WHICH THE APPLES WERE NOW GATHERING
lbi-2412-153954-0013 I SAW A FEW SHEEP WITH ROUNDED NOSES AND ENORMOUS TAILS
lbi-2412-153954-0014 IN ABOUT FOUR HOURS OF WALKING FROM THE TIME WE STARTED AND AFTER PASSING TWO OR THREE MORE VILLAGES WE CAME UPON A CONSIDERABLE TOWN AND MY GUIDES MADE MANY ATTEMPTS TO MAKE ME UNDERSTAND SOMETHING BUT I GATHERED NO INKLING OF THEIR MEANING EXCEPT THAT I NEED BE UNDER NO APPREHENSION OF DANGER
lbi-2412-153954-0015 SUFFICE IT THAT I FOUND MYSELF TAKEN BEFORE THE CHIEF MAGISTRATE AND BY HIS ORDERS WAS PLACED IN AN APARTMENT WITH TWO OTHER PEOPLE WHO WERE THE FIRST I HAD SEEN LOOKING ANYTHING BUT WELL AND HANDSOME
lbi-2412-153954-0016 IN FACT ONE OF THEM WAS PLAINLY VERY MUCH OUT OF HEALTH AND COUGHED VIOLENTLY FROM TIME TO TIME IN SPITE OF MANIFEST EFFORTS TO SUPPRESS IT
lbi-2412-153954-0017 THE OTHER LOOKED PALE AND ILL BUT HE WAS MARVELLOUSLY SELF CONTAINED AND IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITH HIM
lbi-2412-153954-0018 THEY FELT MY PULSE THEY LOOKED AT MY TONGUE THEY LISTENED AT MY CHEST THEY FELT ALL MY MUSCLES AND AT THE END OF EACH OPERATION THEY LOOKED AT THE CHIEF AND NODDED AND SAID SOMETHING IN A TONE QUITE PLEASANT AS THOUGH I WERE ALL RIGHT
lbi-2412-153954-0019 BUT BY AND BY THEY CAME TO MY WATCH WHICH I HAD HIDDEN AWAY IN THE INMOST POCKET THAT I HAD AND HAD FORGOTTEN WHEN THEY BEGAN THEIR SEARCH
lbi-2412-153954-0020 AGAIN THERE WAS A VERY OLD CARRIAGE WHOSE WHEELS IN SPITE OF RUST AND DECAY I COULD SEE HAD BEEN DESIGNED ORIGINALLY FOR IRON RAILS
lbi-2412-153954-0021 WE PASSED MANY CASES AND AT LAST CAME TO ONE IN WHICH THERE WERE SEVERAL CLOCKS AND TWO OR THREE OLD WATCHES
lbi-2412-153954-0022 THE DESIGN WAS DIFFERENT BUT THE THING WAS CLEARLY THE SAME
lbi-2412-153954-0023 THIS HAD SOME EFFECT IN CALMING HIM
lbi-2412-153954-0024 HE BEGAN PRESENTLY TO RELENT AND SPOKE TO ME IN A KINDER MANNER
lbi-2428-83699-0000 I IMAGINE THERE WERE SEVERAL KINDS OF OLD FASHIONED CHRISTMASES BUT IT COULD HARDLY BE WORSE THAN A CHOP IN MY CHAMBERS OR HORROR OF HORRORS AT THE CLUB OR MY COUSIN LUCY'S NOTION OF WHAT SHE CALLS THE FESTIVE SEASON
lbi-2428-83699-0001 FESTIVE YES
lbi-2428-83699-0002 THE REPLY WAS WRITTEN IN A SPRAWLING FEMININE HAND IT WAS A LITTLE VAGUE
lbi-2428-83699-0003 IT APPEARED THAT THE TERMS WOULD BE FIVE GUINEAS BUT THERE WAS NO MENTION OF THE LENGTH OF TIME WHICH THAT FEE WOULD COVER
lbi-2428-83699-0004 THE WHOLE THING WAS A TRIFLE ODD
lbi-2428-83699-0005 THERE WAS NOTHING SAID ABOUT THE SORT OF ACCOMMODATION WHICH WOULD BE PROVIDED NOTHING ABOUT THE KIND OF ESTABLISHMENT WHICH WAS MAINTAINED OR THE TABLE WHICH WAS KEPT
lbi-2428-83699-0006 NOW IT IS A REMARKABLE THING THAT I HAVE ALWAYS HAD AN EXTRAORDINARY PREDILECTION FOR THE NAME MADGE I DO NOT KNOW WHY
lbi-2428-83699-0007 I HAVE NEVER KNOWN A MADGE AND YET FROM MY BOYHOOD UPWARD I HAVE DESIRED TO MEET ONE
lbi-2428-83699-0008 UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES SHE WAS HARDLY LIKELY TO BE LIVELY HERSELF BUT HER NAME WAS MADGE AND IT WAS THE ACCIDENT OF HER CHRISTIAN NAME WHICH DECIDED ME TO GO
lbi-2428-83699-0009 I HAD NO ILLUSIONS
lbi-2428-83699-0010 I DID NOT EXPECT A PRINCELY ENTERTAINMENT
lbi-2428-83699-0011 ALL NIGHT IT HAD BEEN BLOWING AND RAINING
lbi-2428-83699-0012 I FELT QUITE LIVELY MYSELF AS I MINGLED WITH THE CHRISTMAS CROWD LOOKING FOR THINGS WHICH MIGHT NOT TURN OUT TO BE ABSOLUTELY PREPOSTEROUS
lbi-2428-83699-0013 I EVEN BOUGHT SOMETHING FOR MADGE I MEAN MISSUS WILSON
lbi-2428-83699-0014 IT WAS A HORRIBLE JOURNEY
lbi-2428-83699-0015 HE WAS IMPERVIOUS TO REASON
lbi-2428-83699-0016 IT IS SOME SATISFACTION FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO REFLECT THAT I MADE IT WARM FOR THE OFFICIALS HOWEVER COLD I MIGHT HAVE BEEN MYSELF
lbi-2428-83699-0017 WHEN AT LAST I REACHED CROFTON MY JOURNEY'S END IT TURNED OUT THAT THE STATION STAFF CONSISTED OF A HALF WITTED INDIVIDUAL WHO WAS STATIONMASTER PORTER AND CLERK COMBINED AND A HULKING LAD WHO DID WHATEVER ELSE THERE WAS TO DO
lbi-2428-83699-0018 NO ONE HAD COME TO MEET ME THE VILLAGE WAS ABOUT HALF A MILE AND HANGAR DENE THE HOUSE FOR WHICH MY STEPS WERE BENT ABOUT FOUR MILES BY THE ROAD HOW FAR IT WAS ACROSS PLOUGHED FIELDS MY INFORMANT DID NOT MENTION
lbi-2428-83699-0019 THERE WAS A TRAP AT THE BOY AND BLUNDERBUSS BUT THAT REQUIRED FETCHING
lbi-2428-83699-0020 WHEN THE TRAP DID APPEAR IT LOOKED TO ME UNCOMMONLY LIKE AN OPEN SPRING CART
lbi-2428-83699-0021 IN IT I WAS DEPOSITED WITH MY LUGGAGE
lbi-2428-83699-0022 I DID NOT KNOW WHAT HE MEANT
lbi-2428-83699-0023 I DID NOT ASK I WAS BEYOND IT
lbi-2428-83699-0024 I WAS CHILLED TO THE BONE WET TIRED HUNGRY
lbi-2428-83699-0025 I HAD LONG BEEN WISHING THAT AN OLD FASHIONED CHRISTMAS HAD BEEN COMPLETELY EXTINCT BEFORE I HAD THOUGHT OF ADVENTURING IN QUEST OF ONE
lbi-2428-83699-0026 HERE WE BE THAT MIGHT BE SO
lbi-2428-83699-0027 THERE BE THE DOOR IN FRONT OF YOU YOU GO UP THREE STEPS IF YOU CAN FIND EM
lbi-2428-83699-0028 THERE'S A KNOCKER IF NONE OF EM HAVEN'T TWISTED IT OFF
lbi-2428-83699-0029 THERE APPEARED TO BE NO KNOCKER THOUGH WHETHER IT HAD BEEN TWISTED OFF WAS MORE THAN I COULD SAY
lbi-2428-83699-0030 NO ANSWER THOUGH I ALLOWED A MORE THAN DECENT INTERVAL
lbi-2428-83699-0031 BETTER RING AGAIN SUGGESTED THE DRIVER HARD
lbi-2428-83699-0032 MAYBE THEY'RE UP TO SOME OF THEIR GAMES AND WANTS ROUSING
lbi-2428-83699-0033 THE BELL REVERBERATED THROUGH WHAT SEEMED LIKE AN EMPTY HOUSE
lbi-2428-83699-0034 PRESENTLY FEET WERE HEARD ADVANCING ALONG THE PASSAGE SEVERAL PAIRS IT SEEMED AND A LIGHT GLEAMED THROUGH THE WINDOW OVER THE DOOR
lbi-2428-83699-0035 A VOICE INQUIRED WHO'S THERE
lbi-2428-83699-0036 THE INFORMATION WAS GREETED WITH WHAT SOUNDED UNCOMMONLY LIKE A CHORUS OF LAUGHTER
lbi-2428-83699-0037 THERE WAS A RUSH OF RETREATING FEET AN EXPOSTULATING VOICE THEN DARKNESS AGAIN AND SILENCE
lbi-2428-83699-0038 WHO LIVES HERE ARE THE PEOPLE MAD
lbi-2428-83699-0039 I TOLLED THE BELL AGAIN
lbi-2428-83699-0040 AFTER A VAST AMOUNT OF UNFASTENING THE DOOR WAS OPENED AND ON THE THRESHOLD THERE STOOD A GIRL WITH A LIGHTED CANDLE IN HER HAND
lbi-2428-83699-0041 I'M MISTER CHRISTOPHER FROM LONDON
lbi-2428-83699-0042 WE'VE LOST THE KEY OF THE CELLAR AND THERE'S NOTHING OUT EXCEPT WATER AND I DON'T THINK YOU'D CARE FOR THAT
lbi-2428-83705-0000 HER FATHER IS A MOST REMARKABLE PERSON TO SAY THE LEAST
lbi-2428-83705-0001 BUT IT IS QUITE PLAIN TO ME THAT ALL THE ARRANGEMENTS FOR MY WEDDING ARE GOING TO BE MADE BY THE SNELLINGS
lbi-2428-83705-0002 I DO NOT KNOW WHEN IT IS GOING TO BE BUT IT WILL BE EITHER NEXT WEEK OR THE WEEK AFTER CERTAINLY AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE MOMENT AND I SHOULDN'T BE AT ALL SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT ALL MARY ANN'S THINGS HAD BEEN ALREADY BOUGHT AND PERHAPS SOME OF THEM MARKED
lbi-2428-83705-0003 IT IS MOST DELIGHTFUL
lbi-2428-83705-0004 IT MIGHT JUST AS WELL BE SOME ONE ELSE'S WEDDING SO UNIMPORTANT IS THE PART WHICH I AM SET TO PLAY IN IT
lbi-2428-83705-0005 FOR INSTANCE LOOK AT THEIR BEHAVIOUR IN THE MATTER OF THE RING
lbi-2428-83705-0006 THE ACCIDENT IN QUESTION OCCURRED UPON THE SUNDAY EVENING
lbi-2428-83705-0007 THE GIRL IS FRETTING BUT YOU DON'T SEEM TO NOTICE IT
lbi-2428-83705-0008 I GASPED POSITIVELY GASPED
lbi-2428-83705-0009 THAT'S IT ON YOUR ACCOUNT
lbi-2428-83705-0010 FROM A COUSIN OF OURS WHO'S IN THAT LINE
lbi-2428-83705-0011 I NEVER SAW PEOPLE LIKE THE SNELLINGS FOR POSSESSING RELATIVES IN ALL SORTS OF LINES
lbi-2428-83705-0012 I WAS PERSUADED THAT SOMEBODY BESIDES THAT COUSIN GOT A PROFIT OUT OF MARY ANN'S ENGAGEMENT RING BUT I HANDED OVER THE AMOUNT
lbi-2428-83705-0013 IT IS FROM HER ACTION IN THAT MATTER THAT MY SUSPICION SPRINGS
lbi-2428-83705-0014 THERE SHE OWNS A COTTAGE OR IT MAY BE A PIGSTYE FOR ALL I KNOW
lbi-2428-83705-0015 WHEN SHE HEARD OF MY ENGAGEMENT WITH MARY ANN SHE WROTE AND SUGGESTED THAT WE SHOULD SPEND OUR HONEYMOON IN HER COTTAGE OR PIGSTYE AND THAT I SHOULD PAY HER RENT FOR IT
lbi-2428-83705-0016 THERE WERE NO SIGNS OF FALTERING ABOUT HER FLOW OF LANGUAGE
lbi-2428-83705-0017 I FOUND THAT AS A WOMAN OF BUSINESS SHE WAS BEYOND ALL MY EXPECTATIONS
lbi-2428-83705-0018 IT TURNED OUT THAT SHE HAD A LITTLE MONEY OF HER OWN ABOUT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY POUNDS A YEAR
lbi-2428-83705-0019 AND OF COURSE I HAD MY EXPECTATIONS AND SHE HAD HERS
lbi-2428-83705-0020 IT WAS PLAIN THAT TOGETHER WE SHOULD MANAGE MOST COMFORTABLY DELIGHTFULLY IN FACT
lbi-2428-83705-0021 I SHALL MAKE PAPA GIVE ME FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS AT LEAST
lbi-2428-83705-0022 A BIRD IN THE HAND IS WORTH TWO IN A BUSH' AND IT WILL BE SOMETHING TO HAVE BY US
lbi-2428-83705-0023 I KNOW WHAT MAMMA CAN AFFORD TO GIVE AND I WILL SEE SHE GIVES IT
lbi-2428-83705-0024 AND I WILL SEE THAT THERE IS NO SHIRKING ABOUT THE BOYS OR ABOUT THE GIRLS EITHER
lbi-2428-83705-0025 I HAVE DRAWN UP A LIST OF ALL THE PEOPLE WHO OUGHT TO GIVE US A PRESENT AND I SHALL TELL THEM WHAT THEY OUGHT TO GIVE IT WON'T BE MY FAULT IF I DON'T GET IT
lbi-2428-83705-0026 OF COURSE THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WITH WHOM YOU CAN'T BE PERFECTLY PLAIN BUT I SHALL BE AS PLAIN AS I CAN THERE'S A WAY AND A MANNER OF DOING THAT KIND OF THING
lbi-2428-83705-0027 HERS HAS BEEN PRODIGIOUS
lbi-2428-83705-0028 SHE HAS A KNACK OF GETTING PEOPLE TO DO WHAT SHE WISHES AND TO GIVE HER WHAT SHE WANTS WHICH IS A LITTLE SHORT OF MIRACULOUS
lbi-2428-83705-0029 I NOTICE THAT THEY ARE GENERALLY PERSONS WHO HAVE ALREADY TENDERED THEIR OFFERINGS
lbi-2428-83705-0030 THE FACT OF HAVING GIVEN MARY ANN A WEDDING PRESENT SEEMS TO FILL THEM WITH A FEELING OF RANCOROUS ACIDITY WHICH TO ME IS INEXPLICABLE
lbi-2428-83705-0031 SUCH IS THE SELFISHNESS OF HUMAN NATURE
lbi-2428-83705-0032 BUT WHY ON THAT ACCOUNT THEY SHOULD PITY ME I ALTOGETHER FAIL TO UNDERSTAND
lbi-2428-83705-0033 WE HAVE ALL BEEN GIVING MARY ANN PRESENTS AND I SUPPOSE YOU MISTER WHITING HAVE BEEN GIVING HER SOMETHING TOO
lbi-2428-83705-0034 THAT WAS WHAT MISSUS MACPHERSON SAID TO ME ONLY THE OTHER DAY
lbi-2428-83705-0035 AND WHAT INQUIRED MISSUS MACPHERSON HAS MARY ANN GIVEN YOU HER LOVE
lbi-2428-83705-0036 SOMEONE SNIGGERED
lbi-2428-83705-0037 I CANNOT PRETEND TO EXPLAIN WHY EXCEPT ON THE SUPPOSITION THAT ROMANCE IS DEAD AT LEAST IN THAT CIRCLE OF SOCIETY IN WHICH THE SNELLINGS MOVE
lbi-2428-83705-0038 AS IT IS UNLESS I AM MISTAKEN SOME OF THE RENDING WILL BE ON OUR SIDE AND THEY KNOW IT
lbi-2428-83705-0039 P S THE CARDS ARE OUT FOR THE WEDDING
lbi-2428-83705-0040 WE ARE GOING FOR OUR HONEYMOON TO ITALY AND THE SOUTH OF FRANCE
lbi-2428-83705-0041 A SECOND COUSIN OF MARY ANN'S IS IN THE COOK'S TOURS LINE
lbi-2428-83705-0042 HE HAS GIVEN US FREE PASSES ALL THE WAY TO THE END OF OUR JOURNEY AND ALL THE WAY BACK AGAIN AND COUPONS FOR FREE BOARD AND LODGING AT THE HOTEL IT'S A WEDDING PRESENT
lbi-2428-83705-0043 BESIDES WHICH WE CAN ALWAYS SELL THE COUPONS AND RAILWAY PASSES WHICH WE DON'T USE
lbi-251-118436-0000 HE WAS YOUNG NO SPEAR HAD TOUCHED HIM NO POISON LURKED IN HIS WINE
lbi-251-118436-0001 I TELL YOU IT IS NOT POISON SHE CRIED
lbi-251-118436-0002 SINCE HIS BIRTH HE HAS BEEN GUARDED SO CLOSELY THAT THE CLEVEREST POISONERS OF THE EAST COULD NOT REACH HIM
lbi-251-118436-0003 AS YOU WELL KNOW THERE ARE TEN MEN AND TEN WOMEN WHOSE SOLE DUTY IS TO TASTE HIS FOOD AND WINE AND FIFTY ARMED WARRIORS GUARD HIS CHAMBER AS THEY GUARD IT NOW
lbi-251-118436-0004 A LOW CONFUSED MOAN WANED FROM HIS MOUTH
lbi-251-118436-0005 THE MAN SHRUGGED HIS BROAD SHOULDERS AND TURNED BACK INTO THE ARABESQUE CHAMBER
lbi-251-118436-0006 THIS MAN WAS CLAD IN A BROWN CAMEL HAIR ROBE AND SANDALS AND A GREEN TURBAN WAS ON HIS HEAD
lbi-251-118436-0007 NOT UNTIL THE HEAVENS WERE IN THE PROPER ORDER COULD THEY PERFORM THIS NECROMANCY
lbi-251-118436-0008 WITH A LONG STAINED FINGERNAIL HE MAPPED THE CONSTELLATIONS ON THE MARBLE TILED FLOOR
lbi-251-118436-0009 THE SLANT OF THE MOON PRESAGED EVIL FOR THE KING OF VENDHYA THE STARS ARE IN TURMOIL THE SERPENT IN THE HOUSE OF THE ELEPHANT
lbi-251-118436-0010 POINT OF CONTACT INQUIRED THE OTHER
lbi-251-118436-0011 ALL DISCARDED PORTIONS OF THE HUMAN BODY STILL REMAIN PART OF IT ATTACHED TO IT BY INTANGIBLE CONNECTIONS
lbi-251-118436-0012 BUT AT THE URGENT ENTREATY OF THE PRINCESS OF KHOSALA WHO LOVED BHUNDA CHAND VAINLY HE GAVE HER A LOCK OF HIS LONG BLACK HAIR AS A TOKEN OF REMEMBRANCE
lbi-251-118436-0013 BY WHICH A SOUL IS DRAWN FROM ITS BODY AND ACROSS GULFS OF ECHOING SPACE RETURNED THE MAN ON THE MAT
lbi-251-118436-0014 ON THE DAIS UNDER THE GOLDEN DOME THE KING CRIED OUT AGAIN RACKED BY AWFUL PAROXYSMS
lbi-251-118436-0015 THEY SEEK TO SNAP THE SILVER CORD THAT BINDS ME TO MY DYING BODY
lbi-251-118436-0016 THEY CLUSTER AROUND ME THEIR HANDS ARE TALONED THEIR EYES ARE RED LIKE FLAME BURNING IN DARKNESS
lbi-251-118436-0017 THEIR FINGERS SEAR ME LIKE FIRE
lbi-251-118436-0018 I KNOW NOW WHAT BRINGS ME TO THE PYRE
lbi-251-118436-0019 THERE THEY STROVE TO BREAK THE SILVER CORD OF LIFE AND THRUST MY SOUL INTO THE BODY OF A FOUL NIGHT WEIRD THEIR SORCERY SUMMONED UP FROM HELL AH
lbi-251-118436-0020 YOUR CRY AND THE GRIP OF YOUR FINGERS BROUGHT ME BACK BUT I AM GOING FAST
lbi-251-118436-0021 THERE WAS THE OLD IMPERIOUS NOTE IN HIS FAILING WHISPER
lbi-251-118436-0022 YOU HAVE NEVER DISOBEYED ME OBEY MY LAST COMMAND
lbi-251-118436-0023 SEND MY SOUL CLEAN TO ASURA
lbi-251-136532-0000 THEY ALSO FOUND A MARTIAN CALENDAR THE YEAR HAD BEEN DIVIDED INTO TEN MORE OR LESS EQUAL MONTHS AND ONE OF THEM HAD BEEN DOMA
lbi-251-136532-0001 BILL CHANDLER THE ZOOLOGIST HAD BEEN GOING DEEPER AND DEEPER INTO THE OLD SEA BOTTOM OF SYRTIS
lbi-251-136532-0002 THAT TOOK THE CENTER OF INTEREST AWAY FROM ARCHAEOLOGY AND STARTED A NEW BURST OF ACTIVITY
lbi-251-136532-0003 THE CIVILIAN SPECIALISTS IN OTHER FIELDS AND THE SPACE FORCE PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN HOLDING TAPE LINES AND MAKING SKETCHES AND SNAPPING CAMERAS WERE ALL FLYING TO LOWER SYRTIS TO FIND OUT HOW MUCH OXYGEN THERE WAS AND WHAT KIND OF LIFE IT SUPPORTED
lbi-251-136532-0004 THEY HAD FOUR OR FIVE SPECIES OF WHAT MIGHT LOOSELY BE CALLED BIRDS AND SOMETHING THAT COULD EASILY BE CLASSED AS A REPTILE AND A CARNIVOROUS MAMMAL THE SIZE OF A CAT WITH BIRDLIKE CLAWS AND A HERBIVORE ALMOST IDENTICAL WITH THE PIGLIKE THING IN THE BIG DARFHULVA MURAL AND ANOTHER LIKE A GAZELLE WITH A SINGLE HORN IN THE MIDDLE OF ITS FOREHEAD
lbi-251-136532-0005 THE DAILY NEWSCASTS FROM TERRA SHOWED A CORRESPONDING SHIFT IN INTEREST AT HOME
lbi-251-136532-0006 TONY'S FOUND THE MARTIANS
lbi-251-136532-0007 IT WAS LOCKED FROM THE INSIDE AND WE HAD TO BURN IT DOWN WITH A TORCH THAT'S WHERE THEY ARE
lbi-251-136532-0008 GLORIA STANDISH WHO HAD DROPPED IN FOR LUNCH WAS ON THE MEZZANINE FAIRLY SCREAMING INTO A RADIOPHONE EXTENSION DOZEN AND A HALF OF THEM
lbi-251-136532-0009 WELL OF COURSE THEY'RE DEAD WHAT A QUESTION
lbi-251-136532-0010 MARTHA REMEMBERED THE CLOSED DOOR ON THE FIRST SURVEY THEY HADN'T ATTEMPTED OPENING IT
lbi-251-136532-0011 NOW IT WAS BURNED AWAY AT BOTH SIDES AND LAY STILL HOT ALONG THE EDGES ON THE FLOOR OF THE BIG OFFICE ROOM IN FRONT
lbi-251-136532-0012 A FLOODLIGHT WAS ON IN THE ROOM INSIDE AND LATTIMER WAS GOING AROUND LOOKING AT THINGS WHILE A SPACE FORCE OFFICER STOOD BY THE DOOR
lbi-251-136532-0013 MASS SUICIDE THAT'S WHAT IT WAS NOTICE WHAT'S IN THE CORNERS
lbi-251-136532-0014 YES CHARCOAL
lbi-251-136532-0015 SO THEY JUST CAME IN HERE AND LIT THE CHARCOAL AND SAT DRINKING TOGETHER TILL THEY ALL FELL ASLEEP
lbi-251-136532-0016 THE TERRAN PUBLIC WANTED TO HEAR ABOUT MARTIANS AND IF LIVE MARTIANS COULDN'T BE FOUND A ROOM FULL OF DEAD ONES WAS THE NEXT BEST THING
lbi-251-136532-0017 TONY LATTIMER THE DISCOVERER WAS BEGINNING TO CASH IN ON HIS ATTENTIONS TO GLORIA AND HIS INGRATIATION WITH SID HE WAS ALWAYS EITHER MAKING VOICE AND IMAGE TALKS FOR TELECAST OR LISTENING TO THE NEWS FROM THE HOME PLANET
lbi-251-136532-0018 WITHOUT QUESTION HE HAD BECOME OVERNIGHT THE MOST WIDELY KNOWN ARCHAEOLOGIST IN HISTORY
lbi-251-136532-0019 NOT THAT I'M INTERESTED IN ALL THIS FOR MYSELF HE DISCLAIMED AFTER LISTENING TO THE TELECAST FROM TERRA TWO DAYS AFTER HIS DISCOVERY
lbi-251-136532-0020 BRING IT TO THE PUBLIC ATTENTION DRAMATIZE IT
lbi-251-136532-0021 SO I BELIEVE I SHALL GO BACK AT LEAST FOR A WHILE AND SEE WHAT I CAN DO
lbi-251-136532-0022 LECTURES
lbi-251-136532-0023 THE ORGANIZATION OF A SOCIETY OF MARTIAN ARCHAEOLOGY WITH ANTHONY LATTIMER PH D THE LOGICAL CANDIDATE FOR THE CHAIR
lbi-251-137823-0000 I'LL BE GLAD TO TRY SIR HE REPLIED
lbi-251-137823-0001 INSIDE A SECRET ROCKET TELEMETERING DEVICE WAS MOUNTED ON ITS TEST STAND
lbi-251-137823-0002 THIS ISN'T PART OF YOUR TESTING ROUTINE IS IT
lbi-251-137823-0003 ANOTHER ENGINEER RUSHED TOWARD THE DOOR TO SEE WHAT WAS HAPPENING OUTSIDE
lbi-251-137823-0004 ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT CASCADED FROM THE WALL SHELVES AND A HEAVY DUTY CHAIN HOIST CAME LOOSE FROM ITS OVERHEAD TRACK PLUNGING TO THE FLOOR WITH A TERRIFYING CRASH
lbi-251-137823-0005 AN INSTANT LATER IT CRASHED OVER PINNING MARK FABER BENEATH IT
lbi-251-137823-0006 BUD THREW UP HIS ARMS TO PROTECT HIMSELF BUT TOO LATE
lbi-251-137823-0007 FOR MINUTES NO ONE STIRRED AMONG THE WRECKAGE
lbi-251-137823-0008 THEN TOM WHO HAD BEEN STUNNED BY SOME FALLING DEBRIS RAISED HIMSELF TO A SITTING POSITION
lbi-251-137823-0009 TOM'S EYES FOCUSED IN HORROR ON THE WRECKAGE ENVELOPED BY STILL BILLOWING DUST
lbi-251-137823-0010 THE SKY WAS VISIBLE THROUGH SEVERAL GAPING HOLES IN THE ROOF WHICH WAS SAGGING DANGEROUSLY ON ITS SUPPORTING TRUSSES
lbi-251-137823-0011 THE YOUNG INVENTOR HAD JUST NOTICED HIS FRIEND LYING PINNED BENEATH A HEAVY BEAM NEARBY
lbi-251-137823-0012 HIS FRIEND'S EYELIDS FLICKERED
lbi-251-137823-0013 WE'D BETTER NOT TRY TO MOVE HIM TOM DECIDED WE'LL GET AN AMBULANCE
lbi-251-137823-0014 THEY PICKED THEIR WAY THROUGH THE WRECKAGE AND EMERGED ON A SCENE OF FRIGHTFUL DESTRUCTION
lbi-251-137823-0015 LET'S SEE ABOUT GETTING HELP FOR MISTER FABER
lbi-251-137823-0016 AND THE ONLY TRUCK WE HAD AVAILABLE WAS IN THAT BURNING SHED THE SUPERINTENDENT ADDED BITTERLY
lbi-251-137823-0017 ANYHOW WE WANT TO HELP GOT A JOB FOR US
lbi-251-137823-0018 WITHIN MINUTES TOM WAS IN CHARGE OF CLEARING AWAY RUBBLE AND EXTRICATING ANYONE WHO MIGHT BE TRAPPED INSIDE THE BUILDINGS
lbi-251-137823-0019 THE TELEPHONE LINE WAS SOON REPAIRED AND A STEADY STREAM OF RESCUE VEHICLES BEGAN ARRIVING FROM HARKNESS FIRE TRUCKS THREE AMBULANCES AND PRIVATE CARS DRIVEN BY VOLUNTEERS
lbi-251-137823-0020 THE TWO GIRLS WERE AS MUCH UPSET AS TOM'S MOTHER TOM LAUGHED
lbi-251-137823-0021 MISTER SWIFT CAME INTO THE LIVING ROOM JUST THEN AND TOLD TOM HOW WORRIED MISSUS SWIFT AND SANDY HAD BEEN
lbi-251-137823-0022 HE SMILED GUILTILY AS HE ADDED BUT I MUST ADMIT I WAS MORE THAN A LITTLE CONCERNED MYSELF
lbi-251-137823-0023 HE'S A GREAT SCIENTIST
lbi-251-137823-0024 TOM NODDED UNHAPPILY
lbi-251-137823-0025 MALE OR FEMALE HUMAN OR ANIMAL
lbi-251-137823-0026 MISTER SWIFT'S EYES TWINKLED
lbi-2803-154320-0000 FORTUNATELY WILL HALLEY WAS NOT A MAN IN A HURRY AND DID NOT USE A PRESS OF CANVAS OR HIS MASTS WOULD INEVITABLY HAVE COME DOWN
lbi-2803-154320-0001 JOHN MANGLES THEREFORE HOPED THAT THE WRETCHED HULL WOULD REACH PORT WITHOUT ACCIDENT BUT IT GRIEVED HIM THAT HIS COMPANIONS SHOULD HAVE TO SUFFER SO MUCH DISCOMFORT FROM THE DEFECTIVE ARRANGEMENTS OF THE BRIG
lbi-2803-154320-0002 THEIR FRIENDS DID THEIR BEST TO AMUSE THEM
lbi-2803-154320-0003 THEIR MINDS WERE SO DISTRACTED AT THIS CHANGE OF ROUTE AS TO BE QUITE UNHINGED
lbi-2803-154320-0004 MUCH AS THEY HAD BEEN INTERESTED IN HIS DISSERTATION ON THE PAMPAS OR AUSTRALIA HIS LECTURES ON NEW ZEALAND FELL ON COLD AND INDIFFERENT EARS
lbi-2803-154320-0005 HIS EYES WANDERED CEASELESSLY OVER THE BLANK HORIZON
lbi-2803-154320-0006 WHAT THEN MY LORD
lbi-2803-154320-0007 GOD KEEP US FROM SUCH A MEETING WHY JOHN
lbi-2803-154320-0008 WE COULD NOT EVEN FLY FLY JOHN
lbi-2803-154320-0009 YES MY LORD WE SHOULD TRY IN VAIN
lbi-2803-154320-0010 WE WOULD FIGHT TO THE DEATH OF COURSE BUT AFTER THAT
lbi-2803-154320-0011 THINK OF LADY GLENARVAN THINK OF MARY GRANT
lbi-2803-154320-0012 WILL HALLEY IS A BRUTE BUT I AM KEEPING MY EYES OPEN AND IF THE COAST LOOKS DANGEROUS I WILL PUT THE SHIP'S HEAD TO SEA AGAIN
lbi-2803-154320-0013 SO THAT ON THAT SCORE THERE IS LITTLE OR NO DANGER
lbi-2803-154320-0014 BUT AS TO GETTING ALONGSIDE THE DUNCAN GOD FORBID
lbi-2803-154328-0000 THEY WERE NOT TO LEAVE IT AGAIN TILL THE TOPS OF THE WAHITI RANGES WERE LIT WITH THE FIRST FIRES OF DAY
lbi-2803-154328-0001 THEY HAD ONE NIGHT IN WHICH TO PREPARE FOR DEATH
lbi-2803-154328-0002 THE MEAL ENDED
lbi-2803-154328-0003 SLEEP WHICH KEEPS ALL SORROW IN ABEYANCE SOON WEIGHED DOWN THEIR EYELIDS THEY SLEPT IN EACH OTHER'S ARMS OVERCOME BY EXHAUSTION AND PROLONGED WATCHING
lbi-2803-154328-0004 IF IT IS DECREED THAT WE DIE TO MORROW LET US DIE BRAVELY LIKE CHRISTIAN MEN READY TO APPEAR WITHOUT TERROR BEFORE THE SUPREME JUDGE
lbi-2803-154328-0005 GOD WHO READS OUR HEARTS KNOWS THAT WE HAD A NOBLE END IN VIEW
lbi-2803-154328-0006 GLENARVAN'S VOICE FIRM TILL NOW FALTERED
lbi-2803-154328-0007 JOHN YOU HAVE PROMISED MARY WHAT I PROMISED LADY HELENA WHAT IS YOUR PLAN
lbi-2803-154328-0008 I BELIEVE SAID JOHN THAT IN THE SIGHT OF GOD I HAVE A RIGHT TO FULFILL THAT PROMISE
lbi-2803-154328-0009 MY LORD WHICHEVER OF US SURVIVES THE OTHER WILL FULFILL THE WISH OF LADY HELENA AND MARY GRANT
lbi-2803-154328-0010 AT LAST THE MAJOR SAID MY FRIENDS KEEP THAT TO THE LAST MOMENT
lbi-2803-154328-0011 THE JAILER MAY FORGET THAT HE IS ON GUARD THE PRISONER NEVER FORGETS THAT HE IS GUARDED
lbi-2803-154328-0012 ON THAT SIDE DESCENT WAS IMPOSSIBLE AND HAD IT BEEN POSSIBLE THE BOTTOM WAS SHUT IN BY THE ENORMOUS ROCK
lbi-2803-154328-0013 LISTEN SAID HE MOTIONING THEM TO STOOP
lbi-2803-154328-0014 ANIMAL OR MAN ANSWERED THE MAJOR I WILL SOON FIND OUT
lbi-2803-154328-0015 WILSON AND OLBINETT JOINED THEIR COMPANIONS AND ALL UNITED TO DIG THROUGH THE WALL JOHN WITH HIS DAGGER THE OTHERS WITH STONES TAKEN FROM THE GROUND OR WITH THEIR NAILS WHILE MULRADY STRETCHED ALONG THE GROUND WATCHED THE NATIVE GUARD THROUGH A CREVICE OF THE MATTING
lbi-2803-154328-0016 WHAT COULD BE THE OBJECT
lbi-2803-154328-0017 DID THEY KNOW OF THE EXISTENCE OF THE PRISONERS OR WAS IT SOME PRIVATE ENTERPRISE THAT LED TO THE UNDERTAKING
lbi-2803-154328-0018 THEIR FINGERS BLED BUT STILL THEY WORKED ON AFTER HALF AN HOUR THEY HAD GONE THREE FEET DEEP THEY PERCEIVED BY THE INCREASED SHARPNESS OF THE SOUNDS THAT ONLY A THIN LAYER OF EARTH PREVENTED IMMEDIATE COMMUNICATION
lbi-2803-154328-0019 JOHN MANGLES INSERTING THE BLADE OF HIS PONIARD AVOIDED THE KNIFE WHICH NOW PROTRUDED ABOVE THE SOIL BUT SEIZED THE HAND THAT WIELDED IT
lbi-2803-154328-0020 BUT SOFTLY AS THE NAME WAS BREATHED MARY GRANT ALREADY AWAKENED BY THE SOUNDS IN THE HUT SLIPPED OVER TOWARD GLENARVAN AND SEIZING THE HAND ALL STAINED WITH EARTH SHE COVERED IT WITH KISSES
lbi-2803-154328-0021 WATCH THE SAVAGES OUTSIDE SAID ROBERT
lbi-2803-154328-0022 ROUND HIS BODY WAS ROLLED A LONG COIL OF FLAX ROPE
lbi-2803-154328-0023 MY CHILD MY CHILD MURMURED LADY HELENA THE SAVAGES DID NOT KILL YOU
lbi-2803-161169-0000 ONCE THERE WAS A FATHER WHO THOUGHT HE WOULD BUILD FOR HIS CHILDREN A BEAUTIFUL HOME PUTTING INTO IT EVERY THING THEY COULD NEED OR DESIRE THROUGHOUT THEIR LIVES
lbi-2803-161169-0001 THE SWEETEST PERFUMES FLOATED THROUGH THE AIR WHILE THOUSANDS OF BIRDS ANSWERED THE MUSIC OF FOUNTAINS WITH THEIR SONGS
lbi-2803-161169-0002 WHY DID HE GIVE THAT SO ODD A SHAPE OR SO STRANGE A COVERING
lbi-2803-161169-0003 AND SO THROUGH MANY QUESTIONS AND MANY EXPERIMENTS THEY LEARN AT LAST HOW TO USE THE CONTENTS OF THIS ONE STOREHOUSE
lbi-2803-161169-0004 THE ENTRANCE IS LIGHT BECAUSE IT OPENS SO WIDE BUT WE CAN SEE THAT THE FLOOR SLOPES DOWNWARD AND THE WAY LOOKS DARK AND NARROW BEFORE US
lbi-2803-161169-0005 WALK DOWN THE SLOPING FOOT PATH NOW AND BE CAREFUL TO KEEP OUT OF THE WAY OF THE LITTLE CARS THAT ARE COMING AND GOING ON EACH SIDE OF YOU LOADED ON ONE SIDE AND EMPTY ON THE OTHER AND SEEMING TO RUN UP AND DOWN BY THEMSELVES
lbi-2803-161169-0006 LOOK A LITTLE CLOSER WHILE OUR GUIDE LETS THE LIGHT OF HIS LAMP FALL UPON THE BLACK WALL AT YOUR SIDE
lbi-2803-161169-0007 SEE BENEATH YOUR FEET IS THE MARKING OF GREAT TREE TRUNKS LYING ASLANT ACROSS THE FLOOR AND THE FORMS OF GIGANTIC PALM LEAVES STREWED AMONG THEM
lbi-2803-161169-0008 HERE IS SOMETHING DIFFERENT ROUNDED LIKE A NUT SHELL YOU CAN SPLIT OFF ONE SIDE AND BEHOLD THERE IS THE NUT LYING SNUGLY AS DOES ANY CHESTNUT IN ITS BUR
lbi-2803-161169-0009 FERNS AND PALMS MOSSES AND TREES AND ANIMALS ALL PERFECT ALL BEAUTIFUL AND YET ALL HIDDEN AWAY UNDER THIS HILL AND TURNED INTO SHINING BLACK COAL NOW I CAN VERY WELL REMEMBER WHEN I FIRST SAW A COAL FIRE AND HOW ODD IT LOOKED TO SEE WHAT SEEMED TO BE BURNING STONES
lbi-2803-161169-0010 FOR WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL WE ALWAYS HAD LOGS OF WOOD BLAZING IN AN OPEN FIREPLACE AND SO DID MANY OTHER PEOPLE AND COAL WAS JUST COMING INTO USE FOR FUEL
lbi-2803-161169-0011 WHAT SHOULD WE HAVE DONE IF EVERYBODY HAD KEPT ON BURNING WOOD TO THIS DAY
lbi-2803-161169-0012 THESE FORESTS WERE OF TREES DIFFERENT IN SOME WAYS FROM THOSE WE HAVE NOW GREAT FERNS AS TALL AS THIS HOUSE AND MOSSES AS HIGH AS LITTLE TREES AND PALM LEAVES OF ENORMOUS SIZE
lbi-2803-161169-0013 THEN THE HILLS WERE PILED UP ON TOP OF IT ALL BUT HERE AND THERE SOME EDGE OF A COAL BED WAS TILTED UP AND APPEARED ABOVE THE GROUND
lbi-2803-161169-0014 BUT BY AND BY THE WISE MEN THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND SAID TO THEMSELVES WE MUST FIND OUT WHAT USEFUL PURPOSE GOD MADE THE GAS FOR WE KNOW THAT HE DOES NOT MAKE ANY THING FOR HARM ONLY
lbi-2803-161169-0015 IT WAS ONLY A TROUBLE TO THE GAS MAKERS WHO HAD NO USE FOR IT AND EVEN THREW IT AWAY UNTIL SOME ONE MORE THOUGHTFUL THAN THE OTHERS FOUND OUT THAT WATER WOULD NOT PASS THROUGH IT
lbi-2803-161169-0016 DON'T YOU SEE HOW MANY USES WE HAVE FOUND FOR THIS REFUSE COAL TAR
lbi-2803-161169-0017 WHEN YOUR HANDS OR LIPS ARE CRACKED AND ROUGH FROM THE COLD DOES YOUR MOTHER EVER PUT ON GLYCERIN TO HEAL THEM
lbi-2902-9006-0000 ONE WHO WRITES OF SUCH AN ERA LABOURS UNDER A TROUBLESOME DISADVANTAGE
lbi-2902-9006-0001 IN THE PRESENT CASE THAT DISADVANTAGE IS DOUBLED FOR WHILE THE SINS OF THE CHURCH HOWEVER HEINOUS WERE STILL SUCH AS ADMIT OF BEING EXPRESSED IN WORDS THE SINS OF THE HEATHEN WORLD AGAINST WHICH SHE FOUGHT WERE UTTERLY INDESCRIBABLE AND THE CHRISTIAN APOLOGIST IS THUS COMPELLED FOR THE SAKE OF DECENCY TO STATE THE CHURCH'S CASE FAR MORE WEAKLY THAN THE FACTS DESERVE
lbi-2902-9006-0002 NOT BE IT EVER REMEMBERED THAT THE SLIGHTEST SUSPICION OF IMMORALITY ATTACHES EITHER TO THE HEROINE OF THIS BOOK OR TO THE LEADING PHILOSOPHERS OF HER SCHOOL FOR SEVERAL CENTURIES
lbi-2902-9006-0003 THAT DIVINE WORD WHO IS THE LIGHT WHO LIGHTETH EVERY MAN WHICH COMETH INTO THE WORLD HAD AWAKENED IN THE HEART OF MANKIND A MORAL CRAVING NEVER BEFORE FELT IN ANY STRENGTH EXCEPT BY A FEW ISOLATED PHILOSOPHERS OR PROPHETS
lbi-2902-9006-0004 THE VERY EMPERORS HAD ARRAYED THEMSELVES ON HER SIDE
lbi-2902-9006-0005 JULIAN'S LAST ATTEMPT TO RESTORE PAGANISM BY IMPERIAL INFLUENCE HAD ONLY PROVED THAT THE OLD FAITH HAD LOST ALL HOLD UPON THE HEARTS OF THE MASSES AT HIS DEATH THE GREAT TIDE WAVE OF NEW OPINION ROLLED ON UNCHECKED AND THE RULERS OF EARTH WERE FAIN TO SWIM WITH THE STREAM TO ACCEPT IN WORDS AT LEAST THE CHURCH'S LAWS AS THEIRS TO ACKNOWLEDGE A KING OF KINGS TO WHOM EVEN THEY OWED HOMAGE AND OBEDIENCE AND TO CALL THEIR OWN SLAVES THEIR POORER BRETHREN AND OFTEN TOO THEIR SPIRITUAL SUPERIORS
lbi-2902-9006-0006 BUT IF THE EMPERORS HAD BECOME CHRISTIAN THE EMPIRE HAD NOT
lbi-2902-9006-0007 IN THE MEANWHILE THE MINDS OF MEN CUT ADRIFT FROM THEIR ANCIENT MOORINGS WANDERED WILDLY OVER PATHLESS SEAS OF SPECULATIVE DOUBT AND ESPECIALLY IN THE MORE METAPHYSICAL AND CONTEMPLATIVE EAST ATTEMPTED TO SOLVE FOR THEMSELVES THE QUESTIONS OF MAN'S RELATION TO THE UNSEEN BY THOSE THOUSAND SCHISMS HERESIES AND THEOSOPHIES IT IS A DISGRACE TO THE WORD PHILOSOPHY TO CALL THEM BY IT ON THE RECORDS OF WHICH THE STUDENT NOW GAZES BEWILDERED UNABLE ALIKE TO COUNT OR TO EXPLAIN THEIR FANTASIES
lbi-2902-9006-0008 THEY BROUGHT BEFORE THE MINDS OF CHURCHMEN A THOUSAND NEW QUESTIONS WHICH MUST BE SOLVED UNLESS THE CHURCH WAS TO RELINQUISH FOR EVER HER CLAIMS AS THE GREAT TEACHER AND SATISFIER OF THE HUMAN SOUL
lbi-2902-9006-0009 BUT THE HEALTH OF A CHURCH DEPENDS NOT MERELY ON THE CREED WHICH IT PROFESSES NOT EVEN ON THE WISDOM AND HOLINESS OF A FEW GREAT ECCLESIASTICS BUT ON THE FAITH AND VIRTUE OF ITS INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS
lbi-2902-9006-0010 THE MENS SANA MUST HAVE A CORPUS SANUM TO INHABIT
lbi-2902-9006-0011 AND THE NEW BLOOD AT THE ERA OF THIS STORY WAS AT HAND
lbi-2902-9006-0012 TRIBE AFTER TRIBE WAS CROWDING DOWN TO THE ALPS AND TRAMPLING UPON EACH OTHER ON THE FRONTIERS OF THE EMPIRE
lbi-2902-9006-0013 THE HUNS SINGLY THEIR INFERIORS PRESSED THEM FROM BEHIND WITH THE IRRESISTIBLE WEIGHT OF NUMBERS ITALY WITH HER RICH CITIES AND FERTILE LOWLANDS BECKONED THEM ON TO PLUNDER AS AUXILIARIES THEY HAD LEARNED THEIR OWN STRENGTH AND ROMAN WEAKNESS A CASUS BELLI WAS SOON FOUND
lbi-2902-9006-0014 HOW INIQUITOUS WAS THE CONDUCT OF THE SONS OF THEODOSIUS IN REFUSING THE USUAL BOUNTY BY WHICH THE GOTHS WERE BRIBED NOT TO ATTACK THE EMPIRE THE WHOLE PENT UP DELUGE BURST OVER THE PLAINS OF ITALY AND THE WESTERN EMPIRE BECAME FROM THAT DAY FORTH A DYING IDIOT WHILE THE NEW INVADERS DIVIDED EUROPE AMONG THEMSELVES
lbi-2902-9006-0015 THE COUNTLESS TREASURES WHICH FIVE CENTURIES OF RAPINE HAD ACCUMULATED ROUND THE CAPITOL HAD BECOME THE PREY OF MEN CLOTHED IN SHEEPSKINS AND HORSE HIDE AND THE SISTER OF AN EMPEROR HAD FOUND HER BEAUTY VIRTUE AND PRIDE OF RACE WORTHILY MATCHED BY THOSE OF THE HARD HANDED NORTHERN HERO WHO LED HER AWAY FROM ITALY AS HIS CAPTIVE AND HIS BRIDE TO FOUND NEW KINGDOMS IN SOUTH FRANCE AND SPAIN AND TO DRIVE THE NEWLY ARRIVED VANDALS ACROSS THE STRAITS OF GIBRALTAR INTO THE THEN BLOOMING COAST LAND OF NORTHERN AFRICA
lbi-2902-9006-0016 THAT EXTRAORDINARY REFORM IN MORALS WHICH ACCORDING TO SALVIAN AND HIS CONTEMPORARIES THE VANDAL CONQUERORS WORKED IN NORTH AFRICA AVAILED THEM NOTHING THEY LOST MORE THAN THEY GAVE
lbi-2902-9006-0017 CLIMATE BAD EXAMPLE AND THE LUXURY OF POWER DEGRADED THEM IN ONE CENTURY INTO A RACE OF HELPLESS AND DEBAUCHED SLAVE HOLDERS DOOMED TO UTTER EXTERMINATION BEFORE THE SEMI GOTHIC ARMIES OF BELISARIUS AND WITH THEM VANISHED THE LAST CHANCE THAT THE GOTHIC RACES WOULD EXERCISE ON THE EASTERN WORLD THE SAME STERN YET WHOLESOME DISCIPLINE UNDER WHICH THE WESTERN HAD BEEN RESTORED TO LIFE
lbi-2902-9006-0018 THAT WONDERFUL METAPHYSIC SUBTLETY WHICH IN PHRASES AND DEFINITIONS TOO OFTEN UNMEANING TO OUR GROSSER INTELLECT SAW THE SYMBOLS OF THE MOST IMPORTANT SPIRITUAL REALITIES AND FELT THAT ON THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN HOMOOUSIOS AND HOMOIOUSIOS MIGHT HANG THE SOLUTION OF THE WHOLE PROBLEM OF HUMANITY WAS SET TO BATTLE IN ALEXANDRIA THE ANCIENT STRONGHOLD OF GREEK PHILOSOPHY WITH THE EFFETE REMAINS OF THE VERY SCIENTIFIC THOUGHT TO WHICH IT OWED ITS EXTRAORDINARY CULTURE
lbi-2902-9006-0019 TO SYNESIUS'S MOST CHARMING LETTERS AS WELL AS TO THOSE OF ISIDORE THE GOOD ABBOT OF PELUSIUM I BEG LEAVE TO REFER THOSE READERS WHO WISH FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE PRIVATE LIFE OF THE FIFTH CENTURY
lbi-2902-9006-0020 I CANNOT HOPE THAT THESE PAGES WILL BE ALTOGETHER FREE FROM ANACHRONISMS AND ERRORS
lbi-2902-9008-0000 THE PLACE SEEMED FRAGRANT WITH ALL THE RICHES OF GREEK THOUGHT AND SONG SINCE THE DAYS WHEN PTOLEMY PHILADELPHUS WALKED THERE WITH EUCLID AND THEOCRITUS CALLIMACHUS AND LYCOPHRON
lbi-2902-9008-0001 THE ROOM HAD NEITHER CARPET NOR FIREPLACE AND THE ONLY MOVABLES IN IT WERE A SOFA BED A TABLE AND AN ARM CHAIR ALL OF SUCH DELICATE AND GRACEFUL FORMS AS MAY BE SEEN ON ANCIENT VASES OF A FAR EARLIER PERIOD THAN THAT WHEREOF WE WRITE
lbi-2902-9008-0002 BUT MOST PROBABLY HAD ANY OF US ENTERED THAT ROOM THAT MORNING WE SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SPARE A LOOK EITHER FOR THE FURNITURE OR THE GENERAL EFFECT OR THE MUSEUM GARDENS OR THE SPARKLING MEDITERRANEAN BEYOND BUT WE SHOULD HAVE AGREED THAT THE ROOM WAS QUITE RICH ENOUGH FOR HUMAN EYES FOR THE SAKE OF ONE TREASURE WHICH IT POSSESSED AND BESIDE WHICH NOTHING WAS WORTH A MOMENT'S GLANCE
lbi-2902-9008-0003 SHE HAS LIFTED HER EYES OFF HER MANUSCRIPT SHE IS LOOKING OUT WITH KINDLING COUNTENANCE OVER THE GARDENS OF THE MUSEUM HER RIPE CURLING GREEK LIPS SUCH AS WE NEVER SEE NOW EVEN AMONG HER OWN WIVES AND SISTERS OPEN
lbi-2902-9008-0004 IF THEY HAVE CEASED TO GUIDE NATIONS THEY HAVE NOT CEASED TO SPEAK TO THEIR OWN ELECT
lbi-2902-9008-0005 IF THEY HAVE CAST OFF THE VULGAR HERD THEY HAVE NOT CAST OFF HYPATIA
lbi-2902-9008-0006 TO BE WELCOMED INTO THE CELESTIAL RANKS OF THE HEROIC TO RISE TO THE IMMORTAL GODS TO THE INEFFABLE POWERS ONWARD UPWARD EVER THROUGH AGES AND THROUGH ETERNITIES TILL I FIND MY HOME AT LAST AND VANISH IN THE GLORY OF THE NAMELESS AND THE ABSOLUTE ONE
lbi-2902-9008-0007 I TO BELIEVE AGAINST THE AUTHORITY OF PORPHYRY HIMSELF TOO IN EVIL EYES AND MAGIC
lbi-2902-9008-0008 WHAT DO I CARE FOR FOOD
lbi-2902-9008-0009 HOW CAN HE WHOSE SPHERE LIES ABOVE THE STARS STOOP EVERY MOMENT TO EARTH
lbi-2902-9008-0010 AY SHE ANSWERED HALF BITTERLY AND WOULD THAT WE COULD LIVE WITHOUT FOOD AND IMITATE PERFECTLY THE IMMORTAL GODS
lbi-2902-9008-0011 THERE IS FRUIT WITH LENTILS AND RICE WAITING FOR YOU IN THE NEXT ROOM AND BREAD UNLESS YOU DESPISE IT TOO MUCH
lbi-2902-9008-0012 STRANGE THAT MEN SHOULD BE CONTENT TO GROVEL AND BE MEN WHEN THEY MIGHT RISE TO THE RANK OF GODS
lbi-2902-9008-0013 NOT THAT SUCH A CREATURE AS THAT DISTURBS ME NO CREATED THING I HOPE CAN MOVE MY EQUANIMITY BUT IF I COULD STOOP TO HATE I SHOULD HATE HER HATE HER
lbi-2902-9008-0014 AND HER VOICE TOOK A TONE WHICH MADE IT SOMEWHAT UNCERTAIN WHETHER IN SPITE OF ALL THE LOFTY IMPASSIBILITY WHICH SHE FELT BOUND TO POSSESS SHE DID NOT HATE PELAGIA WITH A MOST HUMAN AND MUNDANE HATRED
lbi-2902-9008-0015 HIS EXCELLENCY MADAM THE PREFECT
lbi-2902-9008-0016 AND WHY SHOULD THAT DISTURB ME LET HIM ENTER
lbi-3000-15664-0000 SHASTA RAMBLES AND MODOC MEMORIES
lbi-3000-15664-0001 ARCTIC BEAUTY AND DESOLATION WITH THEIR BLESSINGS AND DANGERS ALL MAY BE FOUND HERE TO TEST THE ENDURANCE AND SKILL OF ADVENTUROUS CLIMBERS BUT FAR BETTER THAN CLIMBING THE MOUNTAIN IS GOING AROUND ITS WARM FERTILE BASE ENJOYING ITS BOUNTIES LIKE A BEE CIRCLING AROUND A BANK OF FLOWERS
lbi-3000-15664-0002 PERHAPS THE PROFESSION OF DOING GOOD MAY BE FULL BUT EVERY BODY SHOULD BE KIND AT LEAST TO HIMSELF
lbi-3000-15664-0003 GO QUIETLY ALONE NO HARM WILL BEFALL YOU
lbi-3000-15664-0004 BUT IT IS FAR BETTER TO GO AFOOT
lbi-3000-15664-0005 ONE BLANKET WILL BE ENOUGH TO CARRY OR YOU MAY FOREGO THE PLEASURE AND BURDEN ALTOGETHER AS WOOD FOR FIRES IS EVERYWHERE ABUNDANT
lbi-3000-15664-0006 ONLY A LITTLE FOOD WILL BE REQUIRED
lbi-3000-15664-0007 THUS ONE SAUNTERS ON AND ON IN THE GLORIOUS RADIANCE IN UTTER PEACE AND FORGETFULNESS OF TIME
lbi-3000-15664-0008 YET STRANGE TO SAY THERE ARE DAYS EVEN HERE SOMEWHAT DULL LOOKING WHEN THE MOUNTAIN SEEMS UNCOMMUNICATIVE SENDING OUT NO APPRECIABLE INVITATION AS IF NOT AT HOME
lbi-3000-15664-0009 AT SUCH TIME ITS HEIGHT SEEMS MUCH LESS AS IF CROUCHING AND WEARY IT WERE TAKING REST
lbi-3000-15664-0010 EVERY CRYSTAL DANCES RESPONSIVE TO THE TOUCHES OF THE SUN AND CURRENTS OF SAP IN THE GROWING CELLS OF ALL THE VEGETATION ARE EVER IN A VITAL WHIRL AND RUSH AND THOUGH MANY FEET AND WINGS ARE FOLDED HOW MANY ARE ASTIR
lbi-3000-15664-0011 SLIGHT RAINSTORMS ARE LIKELY TO BE ENCOUNTERED IN A TRIP ROUND THE MOUNTAIN BUT ONE MAY EASILY FIND SHELTER BENEATH WELL THATCHED TREES THAT SHED THE RAIN LIKE A ROOF
lbi-3000-15664-0012 THEN THE SHINING OF THE WET LEAVES IS DELIGHTFUL AND THE STEAMY FRAGRANCE AND THE BURST OF BIRD SONG FROM A MULTITUDE OF THRUSHES AND FINCHES AND WARBLERS THAT HAVE NESTS IN THE CHAPARRAL
lbi-3000-15664-0013 A THOUSAND THOUSAND VOICES ARE HEARD BUT SO FINELY BLENDED THEY SEEM A PART OF THE NIGHT ITSELF AND MAKE A DEEPER SILENCE
lbi-3000-15664-0014 IN SETTING OUT FROM STRAWBERRY VALLEY BY BEARING OFF TO THE NORTHWESTWARD A FEW MILES YOU MAY SEE
lbi-3000-15664-0015 IN APPROACHING IT ITS SUSPICIOUS LOOKING YELLOW SPOTTED HOOD AND WATCHFUL ATTITUDE WILL BE LIKELY TO MAKE YOU GO CAUTIOUSLY THROUGH THE BOG WHERE IT STANDS AS IF YOU WERE APPROACHING A DANGEROUS SNAKE
lbi-3000-15664-0016 IT IS LINED WITH EMERALD ALGAE AND MOSSES AND SHADED WITH ALDER WILLOW AND THORN BUSHES WHICH GIVE IT A FINE SETTING
lbi-3000-15664-0017 IT IS THREE OR FOUR MILES LONG AND TERMINATES AT AN ELEVATION OF ABOUT NINE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FEET ABOVE SEA LEVEL IN MORAINE SPRINKLED ICE CLIFFS SIXTY FEET HIGH
lbi-3000-15664-0018 THE LONG GRAY SLOPES LEADING UP TO THE GLACIER SEEM REMARKABLY SMOOTH AND UNBROKEN
lbi-3000-15664-0019 MOST OF THE DRAINAGE OF THE GLACIER VANISHES AT ONCE IN THE POROUS ROCKS TO REAPPEAR IN SPRINGS IN THE DISTANT VALLEY AND IT IS ONLY IN TIME OF FLOOD THAT THE CHANNEL CARRIES MUCH WATER THEN THERE ARE SEVERAL FINE FALLS IN THE GORGE SIX HUNDRED FEET OR MORE IN HEIGHT
lbi-3000-15664-0020 TRACING THIS WILD CHANGING CHANNEL GORGE GULLY OR CANYON THE SECTIONS WILL SHOW MOUNT SHASTA AS A HUGE PALIMPSEST CONTAINING THE RECORDS LAYER UPON LAYER OF STRANGELY CONTRASTED EVENTS IN ITS FIERY ICY HISTORY
lbi-3000-15664-0021 REGAINING THE LOW GROUND AT THE BASE OF THE MOUNTAIN AND HOLDING ON IN YOUR GRAND ORBIT YOU PASS THROUGH A BELT OF JUNIPER WOODS CALLED THE CEDARS TO SHEEP ROCK AT THE FOOT OF THE SHASTA PASS
lbi-3000-15664-0022 HERE YOU STRIKE THE OLD EMIGRANT ROAD WHICH LEADS OVER THE LOW DIVIDE TO THE EASTERN SLOPES OF THE MOUNTAIN
lbi-3000-15664-0023 MOUNT BREMER IS THE MOST NOTED STRONGHOLD OF THE SHEEP IN THE WHOLE SHASTA REGION
lbi-3000-15664-0024 LARGE FLOCKS DWELL HERE FROM YEAR TO YEAR WINTER AND SUMMER DESCENDING OCCASIONALLY INTO THE ADJACENT SAGE PLAINS AND LAVA BEDS TO FEED BUT EVER READY TO TAKE REFUGE IN THE JAGGED CRAGS OF THEIR MOUNTAIN AT EVERY ALARM
lbi-3000-15664-0025 WHILE TRAVELING WITH A COMPANY OF HUNTERS I SAW ABOUT FIFTY IN ONE FLOCK
lbi-3000-15664-0026 THE MULE DEER ARE NEARLY AS HEAVY
lbi-3000-15664-0027 THEIR LONG MASSIVE EARS GIVE THEM A VERY STRIKING APPEARANCE
lbi-3000-15664-0028 BUT NEITHER THE GLORIFIED WOODS ON THE ONE HAND NOR THE LAKE ON THE OTHER COULD AT FIRST HOLD THE EYE
lbi-3000-15664-0029 THEN FELL THE GLOAMING MAKING EVERYTHING STILL MORE FORBIDDING AND MYSTERIOUS
lbi-3000-15664-0030 THEN DARKNESS LIKE DEATH
lbi-3000-15664-0031 TWO OR THREE MILES FARTHER ON IS THE MAIN STRONGHOLD OF THE MODOCS HELD BY THEM SO LONG AND DEFIANTLY AGAINST ALL THE SOLDIERS THAT COULD BE BROUGHT TO THE ATTACK
lbi-3000-15664-0032 THE DUCKS LESS WARY KEPT THEIR PLACES MERELY SWIMMING IN AND OUT THROUGH OPENINGS IN THE RUSHES RIPPLING THE GLASSY WATER AND RAISING SPANGLES IN THEIR WAKE
lbi-3000-15664-0033 THEY ARE BROAD RUGGED CREVASSED CLOUDLIKE MASSES OF DOWN GRINDING ICE POURING FORTH STREAMS OF MUDDY WATER AS MEASURES OF THE WORK THEY ARE DOING IN SCULPTURING THE ROCKS BENEATH THEM VERY UNLIKE THE LONG MAJESTIC GLACIERS OF ALASKA THAT RIVERLIKE GO WINDING DOWN THE VALLEYS THROUGH THE FORESTS TO THE SEA
lbi-3000-15664-0034 THUS THE SHASTA RIVER ISSUES FROM A LARGE LAKE LIKE SPRING IN SHASTA VALLEY AND ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THE VOLUME OF THE MC CLOUD GUSHES FORTH IN A GRAND SPRING ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN A FEW MILES BACK FROM ITS IMMEDIATE BASE
lbi-3000-15664-0035 SHOULD THE VOLUME OF THE STREAM WHERE YOU STRIKE IT SEEM SMALL THEN YOU WILL KNOW THAT YOU ARE ABOVE THE SPRING IF LARGE NEARLY EQUAL TO ITS VOLUME AT ITS CONFLUENCE WITH THE PITT RIVER THEN YOU ARE BELOW IT AND IN EITHER CASE HAVE ONLY TO FOLLOW THE RIVER UP OR DOWN UNTIL YOU COME TO IT
lbi-3000-15664-0036 UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS YOU MAY HEAR THE ROAR OF THE WATER RUSHING FROM THE ROCK AT A DISTANCE OF HALF A MILE OR EVEN MORE OR YOU MAY NOT HEAR IT UNTIL WITHIN A FEW RODS
lbi-3000-15664-0037 THE VIVID GREEN OF THE BOULDERS BENEATH THE WATER IS VERY STRIKING AND COLORS THE ENTIRE STREAM WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE PORTIONS BROKEN INTO FOAM
lbi-3000-15664-0038 ASPLENIUM EPILOBIUM HEUCHERA HAZEL DOGWOOD AND ALDER MAKE A LUXURIOUS FRINGE AND SETTING AND THE FORESTS OF DOUGLAS SPRUCE ALONG THE BANKS ARE THE FINEST I HAVE EVER SEEN IN THE SIERRA
lbi-3000-15664-0039 TRACING RIVERS TO THEIR FOUNTAINS MAKES THE MOST CHARMING OF TRAVELS
lbi-3000-15664-0040 AS THE LIFE BLOOD OF THE LANDSCAPES THE BEST OF THE WILDERNESS COMES TO THEIR BANKS AND NOT ONE DULL PASSAGE IS FOUND IN ALL THEIR EVENTFUL HISTORIES
lbi-3000-15664-0041 TRACING THE MC CLOUD TO ITS HIGHEST SPRINGS AND OVER THE DIVIDE TO THE FOUNTAINS OF FALL RIVER NEAR FORT CROOK THENCE DOWN THAT RIVER TO ITS CONFLUENCE WITH THE PITT ON FROM THERE TO THE VOLCANIC REGION ABOUT LASSEN'S BUTTE THROUGH THE BIG MEADOWS AMONG THE SOURCES OF THE FEATHER RIVER AND DOWN THROUGH FORESTS OF SUGAR PINE TO THE FERTILE PLAINS OF CHICO THIS IS A GLORIOUS SAUNTER AND IMPOSES NO HARDSHIP
lbi-3000-15664-0042 THE ASCENT OF LASSEN'S BUTTE IS AN EASY WALK AND THE VIEWS FROM THE SUMMIT ARE EXTREMELY TELLING
lbi-3000-15664-0043 THE LOFTY ICY SHASTA TOWERING HIGH ABOVE ALL SEEMS BUT AN HOUR'S WALK FROM YOU THOUGH THE DISTANCE IN AN AIR LINE IS ABOUT SIXTY MILES
lbi-3000-15664-0044 THE BIG MEADOWS LIE NEAR THE FOOT OF LASSEN'S BUTTE A BEAUTIFUL SPACIOUS BASIN SET IN THE HEART OF THE RICHLY FORESTED MOUNTAINS SCARCELY SURPASSED IN THE GRANDEUR OF ITS SURROUNDINGS BY TAHOE
lbi-3000-15664-0045 THE GREAT WILDS OF OUR COUNTRY ONCE HELD TO BE BOUNDLESS AND INEXHAUSTIBLE ARE BEING RAPIDLY INVADED AND OVERRUN IN EVERY DIRECTION AND EVERYTHING DESTRUCTIBLE IN THEM IS BEING DESTROYED
lbi-3000-15664-0046 EVERY LANDSCAPE LOW AND HIGH SEEMS DOOMED TO BE TRAMPLED AND HARRIED
lbi-3081-166546-0000 WHEN WE TOOK OUR SEATS AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE IT WAS WITH THE FEELING OF BEING NO LONGER LOOKED UPON AS CONNECTED IN ANY WAY WITH THIS CASE
lbi-3081-166546-0001 INSTANTLY THEY ABSORBED ALL MY ATTENTION THOUGH I DARED NOT GIVE THEM A DIRECT LOOK AND CONTINUED TO OBSERVE THEM ONLY IN THE GLASS
lbi-3081-166546-0002 YES AND A VERY RESPECTABLE ONE
lbi-3081-166546-0003 THE LADY IS NOT THE MOTHER OF THE BOYS BUT THEIR AUNT
lbi-3081-166546-0004 THE BOYS BELONG TO THE GENTLEMAN WHO IS A WIDOWER
lbi-3081-166546-0005 GEORGE NODDED
lbi-3081-166546-0006 THE BOYS LOOK WIDE AWAKE ENOUGH IF THE FATHER DOES NOT
lbi-3081-166546-0007 DO THEY STILL INSIST THAT MISS CHALLONER WAS THE ONLY PERSON IN THE ROOM WITH THEM AT THIS TIME
lbi-3081-166546-0008 GEORGE
lbi-3081-166546-0009 HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A SUICIDE
lbi-3081-166546-0010 I KNOW IT SOUNDS FOOLISH BUT THE ALTERNATIVE IS SO IMPROBABLE
lbi-3081-166546-0011 THE BOYS LOOK WIDE AWAKE ENOUGH BUT WHO CAN TELL I WOULD SOONER BELIEVE THAT
lbi-3081-166546-0012 A MAN WAS LOOKING IN FROM THE CORRIDOR BEHIND AT THE FOUR PERSONS WE WERE JUST DISCUSSING
lbi-3081-166546-0013 I INQUIRED OF GEORGE WITH MY EYES STILL ON THIS FURTIVE WATCHER
lbi-3081-166546-0014 I TOOK QUITE A FANCY TO HIM WHY
lbi-3081-166546-0015 I AM LOOKING AT HIM NOW
lbi-3081-166546-0016 JUST AN EVERYDAY DETECTIVE BUT AMBITIOUS I SUPPOSE AND QUITE ALIVE TO THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING THOROUGH
lbi-3081-166546-0017 YES HE'S MERCURIAL IN ALL HIS MOVEMENTS
lbi-3081-166546-0018 WHAT DOES HE WANT
lbi-3081-166546-0019 I ASKED AS SOON AS GEORGE HAD RETURNED TO MY SIDE
lbi-3081-166546-0020 HE WANTS ME TO STAND READY TO OBEY ANY SUMMONS THE POLICE MAY SEND ME
lbi-3081-166546-0021 I EMPHASISED COMPLACENTLY
lbi-3081-166546-0022 HE APPEARED TO KNOW FOR HE TOLD ME AT ONCE THAT HE WAS DETECTIVE GRYCE A MAN WHO HAD GROWN OLD IN SOLVING JUST SUCH BAFFLING PROBLEMS AS THESE
lbi-3081-166546-0023 HE GAVE UP WORK SOME TIME AGO I HAVE BEEN TOLD MY HUSBAND WENT ON BUT EVIDENTLY A GREAT CASE STILL HAS ITS ALLUREMENT FOR HIM
lbi-3081-166546-0024 THE TRAIL HERE MUST BE A VERY BLIND ONE FOR THEM TO CALL HIM IN
lbi-3081-166546-0025 I WISH WE HAD NOT LEFT SO SOON
lbi-3081-166546-0026 HE WAS LATE OF COURSE BUT WHEN HE DID APPEAR I ALMOST FORGOT OUR USUAL GREETING IN MY HURRY TO ASK HIM IF HE HAD SEEN THE EVENING PAPERS
lbi-3081-166546-0027 HOWEVER A LITTLE LATER WE HAD A COMFORTABLE CHAT
lbi-3081-166546-0028 IT WAS ONE WHICH GAVE ME A SMALL TRIUMPH OVER GEORGE
lbi-3081-166546-0029 THE SUGGESTION HE HAD LAUGHED AT WAS NOT SO ENTIRELY FOOLISH AS HE HAD BEEN PLEASED TO CONSIDER IT
lbi-3081-166546-0030 THEIR GREETING WAS CORDIAL AND THE LINES ON THE LATTER'S FACE RELAXED A LITTLE AS HE MET THE STILL BRIGHT EYE OF THE MAN UPON WHOSE INSTINCT AND JUDGMENT SO MUCH RELIANCE HAD ALWAYS BEEN PLACED
lbi-3081-166546-0031 THIS IS VERY GOOD OF YOU HE BEGAN GLANCING DOWN AT THE AGED DETECTIVE'S BUNDLED UP LEGS AND GENTLY PUSHING A CHAIR TOWARDS HIM
lbi-3081-166546-0032 IT'S THE MOST INEXPLICABLE THERE
lbi-3081-166546-0033 BUT CLEWS THERE ARE ABSOLUTELY NONE
lbi-3081-166546-0034 THAT IS WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND ANY PERHAPS YOU CAN
lbi-3081-166546-0035 AT LEAST THAT IS WHAT WE HOPE
lbi-3081-166546-0036 IT'S A CASE IN A THOUSAND GRYCE
lbi-3081-166546-0037 THE OLD MAN'S EYES SHOT FIRE AND UNCONSCIOUSLY ONE FOOT SLIPPED TO THE FLOOR
lbi-3081-166546-0038 SHE HAD NO COMPANION NEAR HER
lbi-3081-166546-0039 NO WORD NO CRY JUST A COLLAPSE AND SUDDEN FALL
lbi-3081-166546-0040 IN OLDEN DAYS THEY WOULD HAVE SAID STRUCK BY A BOLT FROM HEAVEN
lbi-3081-166546-0041 WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT GRYCE
lbi-3081-166546-0042 I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE THE DESK YOU SPEAK OF AND THE SPOT WHERE SHE FELL
lbi-3081-166546-0043 A YOUNG FELLOW WHO HAD BEEN HOVERING IN THE BACKGROUND AT ONCE STEPPED FORWARD
lbi-3081-166546-0044 HE WAS THE PLAIN FACED DETECTIVE WHO HAD SPOKEN TO GEORGE
lbi-3081-166546-0045 THIS SWEETWATER AS THEY CALLED HIM WAS I HAVE SINCE UNDERSTOOD ONE OF HIS PROTEGES AND MORE OR LESS OF A FAVOURITE
lbi-3081-166546-0046 BEEN OVER THE GROUND STUDIED THE AFFAIR CAREFULLY
lbi-3081-166546-0047 VERY WELL THEN YOU'RE IN A POSITION TO PIONEER ME
lbi-3081-166546-0048 WELL WELL THAT'S HONEST AT ALL EVENTS
lbi-3081-166546-0049 BUT I'M IN NO POSITION TO MAKE PROMISES
lbi-3081-166546-0050 OLD DAYS DON'T RETURN FOR THE ASKING
lbi-3081-166546-0051 WHETHER HE GOT ANYTHING ELSE IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY FROM HIS MANNER AS HE FINALLY SANK INTO A CHAIR BY ONE OF THE OPENINGS AND LOOKED DOWN ON THE LOBBY BELOW
lbi-3081-166546-0052 ONE OR TWO OF THE MUSICIANS FROM THE END OF THE HALL
lbi-3081-166546-0053 NATURALLY THEY REACHED HER FIRST
lbi-3081-166546-0054 MARK SOWERBY AND CLAUS HENNERBERG
lbi-3081-166546-0055 HONEST GERMANS MEN WHO HAVE PLAYED HERE FOR YEARS
lbi-3081-166546-0056 WHO CAME NEXT ON THE SCENE SOME PEOPLE FROM THE LOBBY
lbi-3081-166546-0057 ANYBODY BEFORE THE FATHER CAME IN
lbi-3081-166546-0058 YES MISS CLARKE THE MIDDLE AGED LADY WITH THE PARRISHES
lbi-3081-166546-0059 I SUPPOSE SHE HAS BEEN CAREFULLY QUESTIONED VERY I SHOULD SAY
lbi-3081-166546-0060 AND SHE SPEAKS OF NO WEAPON
lbi-3081-166546-0061 NOT TILL THE DOCTOR CAME HER DOCTOR WHO WAS HAPPILY IN HIS OFFICE IN THIS VERY BUILDING
lbi-3081-166546-0062 YES MISTER SLATER THE ASSISTANT MANAGER WHO WAS IN THE LOBBY AT THE TIME SAYS THAT TEN MINUTES AT LEAST MUST HAVE ELAPSED
lbi-3081-166546-0063 NO DOUBT
lbi-3081-166546-0064 SWEETWATER SOMEONE DREW THAT WEAPON OUT
lbi-3081-166546-0065 NOT ALTOGETHER BY ME
lbi-3081-166546-0066 WHEREVER SHE PLEASES ONLY I CAN'T WALK FAR
lbi-3081-166546-0067 IT HAS NOT BEEN RUNNING SINCE LAST NIGHT OR IT WOULD BE FULL OF CURIOUS PEOPLE ALL THE TIME HUSTLING TO GET A GLIMPSE OF THIS PLACE
lbi-3081-166546-0068 BUT THEY'LL PUT A MAN ON FOR YOU
lbi-3081-166546-0069 VERY GOOD MANAGE IT AS YOU WILL
lbi-3081-166546-0070 I'LL WAIT HERE TILL YOU'RE READY EXPLAIN YOURSELF TO THE LADY TELL HER I'M AN OLD AND RHEUMATIC INVALID WHO HAS BEEN USED TO ASKING HIS OWN QUESTIONS
lbi-3081-166546-0071 AS HER QUIET FIGURE APPEARED IN THE DOORWAY SWEETWATER STOLE A GLANCE AT MISTER GRYCE
lbi-3081-166546-0072 THERE WAS NO DOUBTING THEM IN THIS INSTANCE
lbi-3081-166546-0073 YES
lbi-3081-166546-0074 FOR SOME LITTLE TIME THAT IS IT SEEMED LONG THOUGH I BELIEVE IT WAS NOT MORE THAN A MINUTE BEFORE TWO MEN CAME RUNNING FROM THE MUSICIANS GALLERY
lbi-3081-166546-0075 YES MANY TIMES
lbi-3081-166546-0076 WHAT MADE THE DIFFERENCE
lbi-3081-166546-0077 MISS CLARKE STARTED AND HER SWEET FACE SHOWED A MOMENT'S PERPLEXITY DID I SHE QUERIED MUSINGLY
lbi-3081-166546-0078 NO A VERY NATURAL ONE I SHOULD SAY
lbi-3081-166546-0079 AND THE GLANCE SHE CAST HIM WHILE NOT MEETING HIS EYE SHOWED THAT SHE UNDERSTOOD THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ADMISSION
lbi-3081-166546-0080 I KNOW SHE SAID WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO ASK ME NOW
lbi-3081-166546-0081 THERE WAS NO PONIARD IN THE WOUND
lbi-3081-166546-0082 THE TIME IS NARROWED DOWN TO ONE AND IN THAT ONE MISS CLARKE WAS THE ONLY PERSON TO TOUCH HER
lbi-3081-166546-0083 I WILL TROUBLE YOU NO FURTHER
lbi-3081-166546-0084 SWEETWATER HELP ME OUT OF THIS
lbi-3081-166546-0085 BUT VIGOUR RETURNED TO HIM BEFORE HE HAD WELL REACHED THE DOOR AND HE SHOWED SOME OF HIS OLD SPIRIT AS HE THANKED MISS CLARKE AND TURNED TO TAKE THE ELEVATOR
lbi-3081-166546-0086 THE NEXT MINUTE SHE WAS IN THIS LADY'S ARMS
lbi-3081-166546-0087 NO WEAPON PROTRUDED FROM THE WOUND NOR WAS ANY FOUND ON OR NEAR HER IN THE MEZZANINE WHAT FOLLOWS
lbi-3081-166546-0088 SHE STRUCK THE BLOW HERSELF AND THE STRENGTH OF PURPOSE WHICH LED HER TO DO THIS GAVE HER THE ADDITIONAL FORCE TO PULL THE WEAPON OUT AND FLING IT FROM HER
lbi-3081-166546-0089 IT DID NOT FALL UPON THE FLOOR AROUND HER THEREFORE IT FLEW THROUGH ONE OF THOSE OPENINGS INTO THE LOBBY AND THERE IT EITHER WILL BE OR HAS BEEN FOUND
lbi-3170-137482-0000 WITH AN EDUCATION WHICH OUGHT TO HAVE ENSURED ME AN HONOURABLE STANDING IN THE WORLD WITH SOME INTELLIGENCE WIT GOOD LITERARY AND SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE AND ENDOWED WITH THOSE ACCIDENTAL PHYSICAL QUALITIES WHICH ARE SUCH A GOOD PASSPORT INTO SOCIETY I FOUND MYSELF AT THE AGE OF TWENTY THE MEAN FOLLOWER OF A SUBLIME ART IN WHICH IF GREAT TALENT IS RIGHTLY ADMIRED MEDIOCRITY IS AS RIGHTLY DESPISED
lbi-3170-137482-0001 I WAS COMPELLED BY POVERTY TO BECOME A MEMBER OF A MUSICAL BAND IN WHICH I COULD EXPECT NEITHER ESTEEM NOR CONSIDERATION AND I WAS WELL AWARE THAT I SHOULD BE THE LAUGHING STOCK OF THE PERSONS WHO HAD KNOWN ME AS A DOCTOR IN DIVINITY AS AN ECCLESIASTIC AND AS AN OFFICER IN THE ARMY AND HAD WELCOMED ME IN THE HIGHEST SOCIETY
lbi-3170-137482-0002 I FELT THAT IN MY FIRST PROFESSION AS I WAS NOT BLESSED WITH THE VOCATION NECESSARY TO IT I SHOULD HAVE SUCCEEDED ONLY BY DINT OF HYPOCRISY AND I SHOULD HAVE BEEN DESPICABLE IN MY OWN ESTIMATION EVEN IF I HAD SEEN THE PURPLE MANTLE ON MY SHOULDERS FOR THE GREATEST DIGNITIES CANNOT SILENCE A MAN'S OWN CONSCIENCE
lbi-3170-137482-0003 BESIDES I WAS OF OPINION THAT A MAN'S PROFESSION WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE OUGHT TO SUPPLY HIM WITH ENOUGH MONEY TO SATISFY ALL HIS WANTS AND THE VERY POOR PAY OF AN OFFICER WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENT TO COVER MY EXPENSES BECAUSE MY EDUCATION HAD GIVEN ME GREATER WANTS THAN THOSE OF OFFICERS IN GENERAL
lbi-3170-137482-0004 OUR SCANDALOUS PROCEEDINGS OFTEN EXPOSED US TO THE GREATEST DANGER
lbi-3170-137482-0005 WE WOULD VERY OFTEN SPEND THE WHOLE NIGHT RAMBLING ABOUT THE CITY INVENTING AND CARRYING INTO EXECUTION THE MOST IMPERTINENT PRACTICAL JOKES
lbi-3170-137482-0006 WE DID THE SAME WITH PHYSICIANS WHOM WE OFTEN SENT HALF DRESSED TO SOME NOBLEMAN WHO WAS ENJOYING EXCELLENT HEALTH
lbi-3170-137482-0007 WHENEVER WE COULD CONTRIVE TO GET INTO A CHURCH TOWER WE THOUGHT IT GREAT FUN TO FRIGHTEN ALL THE PARISH BY RINGING THE ALARM BELL AS IF SOME FIRE HAD BROKEN OUT BUT THAT WAS NOT ALL WE ALWAYS CUT THE BELL ROPES SO THAT IN THE MORNING THE CHURCHWARDENS HAD NO MEANS OF SUMMONING THE FAITHFUL TO EARLY MASS
lbi-3170-137482-0008 THIS IS THE AMUSING ADVENTURE WHICH CLOSED OUR EXPLOITS
lbi-3170-137482-0009 IN EVERY ONE OF THE SEVENTY TWO PARISHES OF THE CITY OF VENICE THERE IS A LARGE PUBLIC HOUSE CALLED MAGAZZINO
lbi-3170-137482-0010 YET THERE ARE A FEW PRIVATE ROOMS WHICH CONTAIN A TABLE SURROUNDED WITH BENCHES IN WHICH A RESPECTABLE FAMILY OR A FEW FRIENDS CAN ENJOY THEMSELVES IN A DECENT WAY
lbi-3170-137482-0011 THE WAITER OF THE MAGAZZINO CAME TO BE PAID AND OUR CHIEF GAVE HIM WHAT WAS DUE ENJOINING SILENCE UNDER PENALTY OF DEATH
lbi-3170-137482-0012 WE TOOK OUR THREE PRISONERS TO A LARGE BOAT
lbi-3170-137482-0013 WHERE IS MY HUSBAND
lbi-3170-137482-0014 NEVER FEAR YOU SHALL SEE HIM AGAIN TO MORROW
lbi-3170-137482-0015 MY READERS MAY IMAGINE WHETHER WE FELT INCLINED TO LAUGH WHEN THE CHARMING CREATURE BADE US GOOD NIGHT THANKING US ALL WITH PERFECT GOOD FAITH
lbi-3170-137482-0016 TWO DAYS AFTERWARDS OUR NOCTURNAL ORGY BEGAN TO BE TALKED OF
lbi-3170-137482-0017 IT WENT ON TO SAY THAT THE TWO MEN WHO HAD CARRIED HER OFF HAD TAKEN HER TO SUCH A PLACE WHERE THEY HAD AN HOUR LATER BEEN MET BY THE OTHER SIX AND THAT THEY HAD ALL REPAIRED TO THE TWO SWORDS WHERE THEY HAD SPENT AN HOUR IN DRINKING
lbi-3170-137482-0018 THERE WAS NO COWARDLY TRAITOR AMONGST US ALTHOUGH WE WERE ALL POOR BUT FEAR HAD ITS EFFECT AND OUR NOCTURNAL PRANKS WERE NOT RENEWED
lbi-3170-137482-0019 I PICKED IT UP AND COMING UP TO HIM JUST AS HE WAS GOING DOWN THE STEPS I HANDED IT TO HIM
lbi-3170-137482-0020 I TOLD HIM AND HE INSISTED UPON MY COMING WITH HIM IN THE GONDOLA SAYING THAT HE WOULD LEAVE ME AT MY HOUSE
lbi-3170-137482-0021 I RUBBED IT WITH ALL MY STRENGTH BUT HE TOLD ME IN A SORT OF INDISTINCT WHISPER THAT THE NUMBNESS WAS SPREADING ALL ALONG THE LEFT SIDE AND THAT HE WAS DYING
lbi-3170-137482-0022 I JUMPED OUT OF THE GONDOLA AND FOUND MYSELF ON THE VERY SPOT WHERE THREE YEARS BEFORE I HAD TAUGHT RAZETTA SUCH A FORCIBLE LESSON I ENQUIRED FOR A SURGEON AT THE FIRST COFFEE HOUSE AND RAN TO THE HOUSE THAT WAS POINTED OUT TO ME
lbi-3170-137482-0023 TAKING EVERYTHING UPON MYSELF I ORDERED A SERVANT TO HURRY OUT FOR A PHYSICIAN WHO CAME IN A SHORT TIME AND ORDERED THE PATIENT TO BE BLED AGAIN THUS APPROVING THE FIRST BLEEDING PRESCRIBED BY ME
lbi-3170-137482-0024 THINKING I HAD A RIGHT TO WATCH THE SICK MAN I SETTLED MYSELF NEAR HIS BED TO GIVE HIM EVERY CARE HE REQUIRED
lbi-3170-137482-0025 THEY DID NOT KNOW WHO I WAS AND DID NOT LIKE TO ASK ME WHILST I THOUGHT IT BETTER TO PRESERVE A MODEST SILENCE
lbi-3170-137482-0026 HE HAD GAMBLED AND LOST A GREAT DEAL AND HIS BROTHER WAS HIS MOST BITTER ENEMY BECAUSE HE WAS INFATUATED WITH THE IDEA THAT HE HAD TRIED TO POISON HIM
lbi-3170-137482-0027 THE PHYSICIAN WHO ATTENDED HIM WAS NAMED TERRO HE THOUGHT BY SOME PECULIAR TRAIN OF REASONING THAT HE COULD CURE HIM BY APPLYING A MERCURIAL OINTMENT TO THE CHEST TO WHICH NO ONE RAISED ANY OBJECTION
lbi-3170-137482-0028 DELIGHTED WITH SUCH A FORTUNATE RESULT WE LAY DOWN AGAIN
lbi-3170-137482-0029 HE ENTREATED ME TO TELL HIM THE TRUTH
lbi-3170-137482-0030 WHAT EXTRAORDINARY THINGS WILL SOMETIMES OCCUR FROM MERE CHANCE OR FROM THE FORCE OF CIRCUMSTANCES
lbi-3170-137482-0031 UNWILLING TO HURT HIS VANITY BY TELLING HIM THAT HE WAS MISTAKEN I TOOK THE WILD RESOLUTION OF INFORMING HIM IN THE PRESENCE OF HIS TWO FRIENDS THAT I POSSESSED A CERTAIN NUMERAL CALCULUS WHICH GAVE ANSWERS ALSO IN NUMBERS TO ANY QUESTIONS I LIKED TO PUT
lbi-3170-137482-0032 I OBEYED IMPLICITLY AND MET YOUR EXCELLENCY
lbi-3170-137482-0033 THE THREE FRIENDS WERE ASTOUNDED
lbi-3170-137482-0034 I DECLARED MYSELF QUITE WILLING FOR IT WAS NECESSARY TO BRAZEN IT OUT AFTER HAVING VENTURED AS FAR AS I HAD DONE
lbi-3170-137482-0035 HE WROTE THE QUESTION AND GAVE IT TO ME I READ IT I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND EITHER THE SUBJECT OR THE MEANING OF THE WORDS BUT IT DID NOT MATTER I HAD TO GIVE AN ANSWER
lbi-3170-137482-0036 IF THE QUESTION WAS SO OBSCURE THAT I COULD NOT MAKE OUT THE SENSE OF IT IT WAS NATURAL THAT I SHOULD NOT UNDERSTAND THE ANSWER
lbi-3170-137482-0037 THEY ALL ASKED ME HOW LONG I WOULD REQUIRE TO TEACH THEM THE RULES OF MY SUBLIME CALCULUS
lbi-3170-137482-0038 NOT VERY LONG I ANSWERED AND I WILL TEACH YOU AS YOU WISH ALTHOUGH THE HERMIT ASSURED ME THAT I WOULD DIE SUDDENLY WITHIN THREE DAYS IF I COMMUNICATED MY SCIENCE TO ANYONE BUT I HAVE NO FAITH WHATEVER IN THAT PREDICTION
lbi-3170-137482-0039 THEY BELIEVED THAT THROUGH ME THEY POSSESSED THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE THE UNIVERSAL PANACEA THE INTERCOURSE WITH ALL THE ELEMENTARY HEAVENLY AND INFERNAL SPIRITS THEY HAD NO DOUBT WHATEVER THAT THANKS TO MY SUBLIME SCIENCE THEY COULD FIND OUT THE SECRETS OF EVERY GOVERNMENT IN EUROPE
lbi-3170-137482-0040 BUT ALTHOUGH BELIEVING FULLY IN MY ORACLES THEY WERE TOO KIND HEARTED TO THINK THEM THE WORK OF THE DEVIL AND IT SUITED THEIR NATURAL GOODNESS BETTER TO BELIEVE MY ANSWERS INSPIRED BY SOME HEAVENLY SPIRIT
lbi-3170-137482-0041 THEY WERE NOT ONLY GOOD CHRISTIANS AND FAITHFUL TO THE CHURCH BUT EVEN REAL DEVOTEES AND FULL OF SCRUPLES
lbi-3170-137482-0042 AS FOR THE EUCHARIST TRANSUBSTANTIATION THE REAL PRESENCE IT WAS ALL NO MYSTERY TO THEM BUT PALPABLE EVIDENCE AND YET THEY WERE NOT JESUITS
lbi-3170-137482-0043 I MIGHT BE TOLD THAT IF I HAD WISHED TO FOLLOW THE RULES OF PURE MORALITY I OUGHT EITHER TO HAVE DECLINED INTIMATE INTERCOURSE WITH THEM OR TO HAVE UNDECEIVED THEM
lbi-3170-137482-0044 BESIDES I FOUND IT VERY FLATTERING TO MY VANITY TO BECOME THE SUBJECT OF THE SPECULATIVE CHATTERING OF EMPTY FOOLS WHO HAVING NOTHING ELSE TO DO ARE ALWAYS TRYING TO FIND OUT THE CAUSE OF EVERY MORAL PHENOMENON THEY MEET WITH WHICH THEIR NARROW INTELLECT CANNOT UNDERSTAND
lbi-3170-137482-0045 WHOEVER YOU MAY BE I AM INDEBTED TO YOU FOR MY LIFE
lbi-3170-137482-0046 YOUR APARTMENT IS READY YOU MAY SEND YOUR CLOTHES YOU SHALL HAVE A SERVANT A GONDOLA AT YOUR ORDERS MY OWN TABLE AND TEN SEQUINS A MONTH
lbi-3170-137482-0047 YOU NEED NOT THINK OF THE FUTURE THINK ONLY OF ENJOYING YOURSELF AND TAKE ME AS YOUR ADVISER IN EVERYTHING THAT MAY HAPPEN TO YOU IN EVERYTHING YOU MAY WISH TO UNDERTAKE AND YOU MAY BE CERTAIN OF ALWAYS FINDING ME YOUR FRIEND
lbi-3170-137482-0048 I THREW MYSELF AT HIS FEET TO ASSURE HIM OF MY GRATITUDE AND EMBRACED HIM CALLING HIM MY FATHER
lbi-3536-23268-0000 SIR EDWARD NOT WHOLLY DISCOURAGED BY THE DENIAL WITH WHICH DORRIFORTH HAD WITH DELICACY ACQUAINTED HIM STILL HOPED FOR A KIND RECEPTION AND WAS SO OFTEN AT THE HOUSE OF MISSUS HORTON THAT LORD FREDERICK'S JEALOUSY WAS EXCITED AND THE TORTURES HE SUFFERED IN CONSEQUENCE CONVINCED HIM BEYOND A DOUBT OF THE SINCERITY OF HIS AFFECTION
lbi-3536-23268-0001 EVERY TIME HE BEHELD THE OBJECT OF HIS PASSION FOR HE STILL CONTINUED HIS VISITS THOUGH NOT SO FREQUENTLY AS HERETOFORE HE PLEADED HIS CAUSE WITH SUCH ARDOUR THAT MISS WOODLEY WHO WAS SOMETIMES PRESENT AND EVER COMPASSIONATE COULD NOT RESIST WISHING HIM SUCCESS
lbi-3536-23268-0002 YET DID THE WATCHFUL MISS WOODLEY OFTENTIMES HEAR A SIGH ESCAPE FROM HER UNKNOWN TO HERSELF TILL SHE WAS REMINDED OF IT AND THEN A SUDDEN BLUSH WOULD INSTANTLY OVERSPREAD HER FACE
lbi-3536-23268-0003 NIGHT AFTER NIGHT HIS SLEEP HAD BEEN DISTURBED BY FEARS FOR HER WHEN ABROAD MORNING AFTER MORNING IT HAD BEEN BROKEN BY THE CLAMOUR OF HER RETURN
lbi-3536-23268-0004 I HOPE MISS MILNER YOU PASS THIS EVENING AT HOME
lbi-3536-23268-0005 I THOUGHT MISS MILNER YOU GAVE ME YOUR WORD THAT YOU WOULD PASS THIS EVENING AT HOME
lbi-3536-23268-0006 YES INDEED AND I BELIEVE IT IS RIGHT THAT I SHOULD KEEP MY FIRST PROMISE IS IT NOT
lbi-3536-23268-0007 MISSUS HORTON ROSE FROM HER SEAT MOVED THE DECANTERS AND FRUIT ROUND THE TABLE STIRRED THE FIRE AND CAME BACK TO HER SEAT AGAIN BEFORE ANOTHER WORD WAS UTTERED
lbi-3536-23268-0008 NOR HAD THIS GOOD WOMAN'S OFFICIOUS LABOURS TAKEN THE LEAST FROM THE AWKWARDNESS OF THE SILENCE WHICH AS SOON AS THE BUSTLE SHE HAD MADE WAS OVER RETURNED IN ITS FULL FORCE
lbi-3536-23268-0009 MISS MILNER YOU SHALL NOT LEAVE THE HOUSE THIS EVENING SIR
lbi-3536-23268-0010 AND HE WALKED IMMEDIATELY OUT OF THE APARTMENT BY ANOTHER DOOR
lbi-3536-23268-0011 HER HAND FELL MOTIONLESS FROM THAT WHICH SHE HELD SHE APPEARED MOTIONLESS HERSELF TILL MISSUS HORTON BESEECHING HER NOT TO BE UNEASY AT THE TREATMENT SHE HAD RECEIVED MADE HER TEARS FLOW AS IF HER HEART WAS BREAKING
lbi-3536-23268-0012 IT WAS NOT FROM ANY REAL CAUSE OF GRIEF THAT SHE WEPT BUT THERE WAS A MAGNETIC QUALITY IN TEARS WHICH ALWAYS ATTRACTED HER'S
lbi-3536-23268-0013 DO YOU THINK I WOULD GO ANSWERED MISS MILNER WITH AN EAGERNESS THAT FOR A TIME SUPPRESSED HER TEARS IN CONTRADICTION TO HIS WILL
lbi-3536-23268-0014 IF YOU THINK SO MADAM I SEE NOTHING THAT SHOULD PREVENT ME NOW
lbi-3536-23268-0015 NIECE I COMMAND YOU NOT TO STIR OUT OF THIS ROOM THIS EVENING
lbi-3536-23268-0016 MISS WOODLEY OBEDIENTLY SAT DOWN AND THOUGH HER THOUGHTS AND HEART WERE IN THE CHAMBER OF HER FRIEND SHE NEVER MARKED BY ONE IMPERTINENT WORD OR BY ONE LINE OF HER FACE THE RESTRAINT SHE SUFFERED
lbi-3536-23268-0017 AT THE USUAL HOUR MISTER DORRIFORTH AND HIS WARD WERE SUMMONED TO TEA HE ENTERED WITH A COUNTENANCE WHICH EVINCED THE REMAINS OF ANGER HIS EYE GAVE TESTIMONY OF HIS ABSENT THOUGHTS AND THOUGH HE TOOK UP A PAMPHLET AFFECTING TO READ IT WAS PLAIN TO DISCERN THAT HE SCARCELY KNEW HE HELD IT IN HIS HAND
lbi-3536-23268-0018 MISS WOODLEY THOUGHT IT HER DUTY TO BE MUTE AND NOW THE GINGLE OF A TEA SPOON WAS LIKE A DEEP TONED BELL ALL WAS SO QUIET
lbi-3536-23268-0019 MISSUS HORTON TOO IN THE SELF APPROVING REFLECTION THAT SHE WAS NOT IN A QUARREL OR ALTERCATION OF ANY KIND FELT HERSELF AT THIS MOMENT REMARKABLY PEACEFUL AND CHARITABLE
lbi-3536-23268-0020 MISS WOODLEY DID NOT RECOLLECT HERSELF SO BUT WAS SO IN REALITY IN HER PEACE AND CHARITY WERE INSTINCTIVE VIRTUES ACCIDENT COULD NOT INCREASE THEM
lbi-3536-23268-0021 HE COUGHED DRANK HIS TEA ENDEAVOURED TO TALK BUT FOUND IT DIFFICULT SOMETIMES READ AND IN THIS MANNER NEAR TWO HOURS WERE PASSED AWAY WHEN MISS MILNER CAME INTO THE ROOM NOT DRESSED FOR A BALL BUT AS SHE HAD RISEN FROM DINNER
lbi-3536-23268-0022 DORRIFORTH READ ON AND SEEMED AFRAID OF LOOKING UP LEST HE SHOULD SEE WHAT HE COULD NOT HAVE PARDONED
lbi-3536-23268-0023 AFTER A FEW MINUTES PAUSE AND SOME LITTLE EMBARRASSMENT ON THE PART OF MISSUS HORTON AT THE DISAPPOINTMENT SHE HAD TO ENCOUNTER FROM THIS UNEXPECTED DUTIFUL CONDUCT SHE ASKED MISS MILNER IF SHE WOULD NOW HAVE ANY TEA
lbi-3536-23268-0024 DORRIFORTH THEN LAID THE BOOK OUT OF HIS HAND AND BY THE TIME THE SERVANT HAD LEFT THE ROOM THUS BEGAN
lbi-3536-23268-0025 IT IS OFTEN THE UNGRATEFUL TASK OF A FRIEND TO BE TROUBLESOME SOMETIMES UNMANNERLY
lbi-3536-23268-0026 FORGIVE THE DUTIES OF MY OFFICE AND BELIEVE THAT NO ONE IS HALF SO MUCH CONCERNED IF IT ROBS YOU OF ANY DEGREE OF HAPPINESS AS I MYSELF AM
lbi-3536-23268-0027 WHAT HE SAID HE LOOKED WITH SO MUCH SINCERITY THAT HAD SHE BEEN BURNING WITH RAGE AT HIS LATE BEHAVIOUR SHE MUST HAVE FORGIVEN HIM FOR THE REGRET WHICH HE SO FORCIBLY EXPREST
lbi-3536-23268-0028 SHE WAS GOING TO REPLY BUT FOUND SHE COULD NOT WITHOUT ACCOMPANYING HER WORDS WITH TEARS THEREFORE AFTER THE FIRST ATTEMPT SHE DESISTED
lbi-3536-23268-0029 ON THIS HE ROSE FROM HIS CHAIR AND GOING TO HER SAID ONCE MORE SHEW YOUR SUBMISSION BY OBEYING ME A SECOND TIME TO DAY
lbi-3536-23268-0030 KEEP YOUR APPOINTMENT AND BE ASSURED THAT I SHALL ISSUE MY COMMANDS WITH MORE CIRCUMSPECTION FOR THE FUTURE AS I FIND HOW STRICTLY THEY ARE COMPLIED WITH
lbi-3536-8226-0000 IN THE LAST COMMUNICATION WHICH HE HAD RECEIVED FROM LADY MILBOROUGH SHE HAD SCOLDED HIM IN TERMS THAT WERE FOR HER SEVERE BECAUSE HE HAD NOT RETURNED TO HIS WIFE AND TAKEN HER OFF WITH HIM TO NAPLES
lbi-3536-8226-0001 AND NOW IT HAD COME TO PASS THAT HIS SOLE REMAINING ALLY MISTER SAMUEL BOZZLE THE EX POLICEMAN WAS BECOMING WEARY OF HIS SERVICE
lbi-3536-8226-0002 AT LAST HE SENT WORD TO SAY THAT HE HIMSELF WOULD BE IN ENGLAND BEFORE THE END OF MARCH AND WOULD SEE THAT THE MAJESTY OF THE LAW SHOULD BE VINDICATED IN HIS FAVOUR
lbi-3536-8226-0003 IN MAKING THIS HE HAD EXPECTED NO SUCCESS THOUGH FROM THE ENERGETIC NATURE OF HIS DISPOSITION HE HAD MADE THE ATTEMPT WITH SOME ZEAL
lbi-3536-8226-0004 MISSUS BOZZLE WAS DISPOSED TO THINK THAT LADIES OF QUALITY AMONG WHOM MADAME T WAS ENTITLED IN HER ESTIMATION TO TAKE RANK WERE SELDOM BETTER THAN THEY OUGHT TO BE AND SHE WAS QUITE WILLING THAT HER HUSBAND SHOULD EARN HIS BREAD BY WATCHING THE LADY OR THE LADY'S LOVER
lbi-3536-8226-0005 AND HAD THE CASE BEEN BROUGHT BEFORE THE JUDGE ORDINARY BY MEANS OF HER HUSBAND'S EXERTIONS SHE WOULD HAVE TAKEN PLEASURE IN READING EVERY WORD OF THE EVIDENCE EVEN THOUGH HER HUSBAND SHOULD HAVE BEEN EVER SO ROUGHLY HANDLED BY THE LAWYERS
lbi-3536-8226-0006 A DISTINCT PROMISE OF A HUNDRED POUNDS WAS MADE TO HIM IF HE WOULD HAVE THE CHILD READY TO HAND OVER TO TREVELYAN ON TREVELYAN'S ARRIVAL IN ENGLAND
lbi-3536-8226-0007 OF COURSE IT AIN'T SAID MISSUS BOZZLE
lbi-3536-8226-0008 THE PATERNAL PARENT HAS A RIGHT TO HIS INFANTS NO DOUBT THAT WAS BOZZLE'S LAW
lbi-3536-8226-0009 HE CAN'T SUCKLE EM CAN HE
lbi-3536-8226-0010 WHEN A MARRIED WOMAN HAS FOLLOWERS AND THE HUSBAND DON'T GO THE WRONG SIDE OF THE POST TOO OR IT AIN'T PROVED AGAIN HIM THAT HE DO THEY'LL NEVER LET HER HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE CHILDREN
lbi-3536-8226-0011 I'LL TELL YOU WHAT IT IS B EXCLAIMED MISSUS BOZZLE IT'S MY BELIEF AS HE AIN'T QUITE RIGHT UP HERE AND MISSUS BOZZLE TOUCHED HER FOREHEAD
lbi-3536-8226-0012 DRAT EM ALL WHAT IS IT THEY WANTS THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY WANTS
lbi-3536-8226-0013 IT'S THAT AS MAKES EM I WON'T SAY WHAT
lbi-3536-8226-0014 BUT AS FOR THIS HERE CHILD B
lbi-3536-8226-0015 TREVELYAN HAD FOLLOWED HIS LETTER QUICKER THAN HE HAD INTENDED WHEN IT WAS WRITTEN AND WAS NOW WITH HIS PRIME MINISTER BEFORE HIS PRIME MINISTER HAD BEEN ABLE TO TAKE ANY ACTION ON THE LAST INSTRUCTION RECEIVED
lbi-3536-8226-0016 DOES ONE MISTER SAMUEL BOZZLE LIVE HERE ASKED TREVELYAN
lbi-3536-8226-0017 THEN BOZZLE CAME FORWARD AND INTRODUCED HIS WIFE
lbi-3536-8226-0018 BUT TREVELYAN WAS OF A DIFFERENT OPINION AND HE WAS DISGUSTED AND REVOLTED MOST UNREASONABLY BY THE APPEARANCE OF HIS MINISTER'S DOMESTIC ARRANGEMENTS
lbi-3536-8226-0019 BOZZLE HAD ALWAYS WAITED UPON HIM WITH A DECENT COAT AND A WELL BRUSHED HAT AND CLEAN SHOES
lbi-3536-8226-0020 IT IS VERY MUCH EASIER FOR SUCH MEN AS MISTER BOZZLE TO CARRY DECENCY OF APPEARANCE ABOUT WITH THEM THAN TO KEEP IT AT HOME
lbi-3536-8226-0021 PERHAPS YOU COULD PUT ON YOUR COAT AND WALK OUT WITH ME FOR A FEW MINUTES SAID TREVELYAN
lbi-3536-8226-0022 MISSUS BOZZLE WHO WELL UNDERSTOOD THAT BUSINESS WAS BUSINESS AND THAT WIVES WERE NOT BUSINESS FELT NO ANGER AT THIS AND HANDED HER HUSBAND HIS BEST COAT
lbi-3536-8226-0023 BOZZLE AWAY FROM HIS OWN HOME OUT ON BUSINESS WITH HIS COAT BUTTONED OVER HIS BREAST AND HIS BEST HAT IN HIS HAND WAS AWARE THAT HE COMMANDED RESPECT AND HE COULD CARRY HIMSELF ACCORDINGLY
lbi-3536-8226-0024 I DO NOT SUPPOSE THAT ANYBODY WILL QUESTION MY RIGHT TO HAVE THE CARE OF MY OWN CHILD SAID TREVELYAN
lbi-3536-8226-0025 IF YOU WOULD HAVE GONE TO MISTER SKINT SIR SUGGESTED BOZZLE
lbi-3536-8226-0026 AS HE WENT ABOUT HIS EYES WERE EVER CAST DOWNWARDS AND HE WALKED WITH A QUICK SHUFFLING GAIT AND HE SUSPECTED OTHERS FEELING THAT HE HIMSELF WAS SUSPECTED
lbi-3536-8226-0027 AND ALL WORK HAD CEASED WITH HIM
lbi-3536-8226-0028 HE'S UP IN TOWN SIR A MINDING OF HIS PARLIAMENTARY DUTIES
lbi-3536-8226-0029 I'VE WATCHED AS SHARP AS WATCHING CAN GO PRETTY NEAR
lbi-3536-8226-0030 BUT IF YOU ASK ME MY OPINION WHY IN COURSE THEY'VE BEEN TOGETHER SOMEWHERE
lbi-3536-8226-0031 AND BOZZLE AS HE SAID THIS SMILED ALMOST ALOUD
lbi-3536-8226-0032 AND HE DID GO AWAY LEAVING BOZZLE STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF STONY WALK
lbi-3576-138058-0000 MASTER AND MAN DISMOUNTED FROM THEIR BEASTS AND AS SOON AS THEY HAD SETTLED THEMSELVES AT THE FOOT OF THE TREES SANCHO WHO HAD HAD A GOOD NOONTIDE MEAL THAT DAY LET HIMSELF WITHOUT MORE ADO PASS THE GATES OF SLEEP
lbi-3576-138058-0001 BUT DON QUIXOTE WHOM HIS THOUGHTS FAR MORE THAN HUNGER KEPT AWAKE COULD NOT CLOSE AN EYE AND ROAMED IN FANCY TO AND FRO THROUGH ALL SORTS OF PLACES
lbi-3576-138058-0002 AT ONE MOMENT IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE WAS IN THE CAVE OF MONTESINOS AND SAW DULCINEA TRANSFORMED INTO A COUNTRY WENCH SKIPPING AND MOUNTING UPON HER SHE ASS AGAIN THAT THE WORDS OF THE SAGE MERLIN WERE SOUNDING IN HIS EARS SETTING FORTH THE CONDITIONS TO BE OBSERVED AND THE EXERTIONS TO BE MADE FOR THE DISENCHANTMENT OF DULCINEA
lbi-3576-138058-0003 WHO IS TOUCHING ME AND UNTRUSSING ME
lbi-3576-138058-0004 DULCINEA IS PERISHING THOU ART LIVING ON REGARDLESS I AM DYING OF HOPE DEFERRED THEREFORE UNTRUSS THYSELF WITH A GOOD WILL FOR MINE IT IS HERE IN THIS RETIRED SPOT TO GIVE THEE AT LEAST TWO THOUSAND LASHES
lbi-3576-138058-0005 SEEING THIS SANCHO GOT UP AND GRAPPLING WITH HIS MASTER HE GRIPPED HIM WITH ALL HIS MIGHT IN HIS ARMS GIVING HIM A TRIP WITH THE HEEL STRETCHED HIM ON THE GROUND ON HIS BACK AND PRESSING HIS RIGHT KNEE ON HIS CHEST HELD HIS HANDS IN HIS OWN SO THAT HE COULD NEITHER MOVE NOR BREATHE
lbi-3576-138058-0006 HOW NOW TRAITOR EXCLAIMED DON QUIXOTE
lbi-3576-138058-0007 DOST THOU REVOLT AGAINST THY MASTER AND NATURAL LORD
lbi-3576-138058-0008 DOST THOU RISE AGAINST HIM WHO GIVES THEE HIS BREAD
lbi-3576-138058-0009 DON QUIXOTE GAVE HIS PROMISE AND SWORE BY THE LIFE OF HIS THOUGHTS NOT TO TOUCH SO MUCH AS A HAIR OF HIS GARMENTS AND TO LEAVE HIM ENTIRELY FREE AND TO HIS OWN DISCRETION TO WHIP HIMSELF WHENEVER HE PLEASED
lbi-3576-138058-0010 SANCHO ROSE AND REMOVED SOME DISTANCE FROM THE SPOT BUT AS HE WAS ABOUT TO PLACE HIMSELF LEANING AGAINST ANOTHER TREE HE FELT SOMETHING TOUCH HIS HEAD AND PUTTING UP HIS HANDS ENCOUNTERED SOMEBODY'S TWO FEET WITH SHOES AND STOCKINGS ON THEM
lbi-3576-138058-0011 HE TREMBLED WITH FEAR AND MADE FOR ANOTHER TREE WHERE THE VERY SAME THING HAPPENED TO HIM AND HE FELL A SHOUTING CALLING UPON DON QUIXOTE TO COME AND PROTECT HIM
lbi-3576-138058-0012 DON QUIXOTE DID SO AND ASKED HIM WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM AND WHAT HE WAS AFRAID OF
lbi-3576-138058-0013 SANCHO REPLIED THAT ALL THE TREES WERE FULL OF MEN'S FEET AND LEGS
lbi-3576-138058-0014 DON QUIXOTE WAS ON FOOT WITH HIS HORSE UNBRIDLED AND HIS LANCE LEANING AGAINST A TREE AND IN SHORT COMPLETELY DEFENCELESS HE THOUGHT IT BEST THEREFORE TO FOLD HIS ARMS AND BOW HIS HEAD AND RESERVE HIMSELF FOR A MORE FAVOURABLE OCCASION AND OPPORTUNITY
lbi-3576-138058-0015 HE WAS MOUNTED UPON A POWERFUL HORSE AND HAD ON A COAT OF MAIL WITH FOUR OF THE PISTOLS THEY CALL PETRONELS IN THAT COUNTRY AT HIS WAIST
lbi-3576-138058-0016 HE SAW THAT HIS SQUIRES FOR SO THEY CALL THOSE WHO FOLLOW THAT TRADE WERE ABOUT TO RIFLE SANCHO PANZA BUT HE ORDERED THEM TO DESIST AND WAS AT ONCE OBEYED SO THE GIRDLE ESCAPED
lbi-3576-138058-0017 HE SAW ME HE PAID COURT TO ME I LISTENED TO HIM AND UNKNOWN TO MY FATHER I LOVED HIM FOR THERE IS NO WOMAN HOWEVER SECLUDED SHE MAY LIVE OR CLOSE SHE MAY BE KEPT WHO WILL NOT HAVE OPPORTUNITIES AND TO SPARE FOR FOLLOWING HER HEADLONG IMPULSES
lbi-3576-138058-0018 IN A WORD HE PLEDGED HIMSELF TO BE MINE AND I PROMISED TO BE HIS WITHOUT CARRYING MATTERS ANY FURTHER
lbi-3576-138058-0019 GIVE ME MY HORSE AND ARMS AND WAIT FOR ME HERE I WILL GO IN QUEST OF THIS KNIGHT AND DEAD OR ALIVE I WILL MAKE HIM KEEP HIS WORD PLIGHTED TO SO GREAT BEAUTY
lbi-3576-138058-0020 NOBODY NEED HAVE ANY DOUBT ABOUT THAT SAID SANCHO FOR MY MASTER HAS A VERY HAPPY KNACK OF MATCHMAKING IT'S NOT MANY DAYS SINCE HE FORCED ANOTHER MAN TO MARRY WHO IN THE SAME WAY BACKED OUT OF HIS PROMISE TO ANOTHER MAIDEN AND IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR HIS PERSECUTORS THE ENCHANTERS CHANGING THE MAN'S PROPER SHAPE INTO A LACQUEY'S THE SAID MAIDEN WOULD NOT BE ONE THIS MINUTE
lbi-3576-138058-0021 THEY MADE HASTE TO OVERTAKE THEM WHICH AS THE PARTY MOVED SLOWLY THEY WERE ABLE TO DO WITH EASE
lbi-3576-138058-0022 THE WOUNDED GENTLEMAN OPENED HIS ALL BUT CLOSED EYES AND RECOGNISING CLAUDIA SAID I SEE CLEARLY FAIR AND MISTAKEN LADY THAT IT IS THOU THAT HAST SLAIN ME A PUNISHMENT NOT MERITED OR DESERVED BY MY FEELINGS TOWARDS THEE FOR NEVER DID I MEAN TO NOR COULD I WRONG THEE IN THOUGHT OR DEED
lbi-3576-138058-0023 IT IS NOT TRUE THEN SAID CLAUDIA THAT THOU WERT GOING THIS MORNING TO MARRY LEONORA THE DAUGHTER OF THE RICH BALVASTRO
