lbi-6455-67804-0028 BAROLD STOOD GNAWING HIS MUSTACHE AND MADE NO REPLY HE WAS NOT VERY COMFORTABLE
lbi-6455-67804-0029 HE FELT HIMSELF ILL USED BY FATE AND RATHER WISHED HE HAD RETURNED TO LONDON FROM BROADOAKS INSTEAD OF LOITERING IN SLOWBRIDGE
lbi-6455-67804-0030 HE HAD AMUSED HIMSELF AT FIRST BUT IN TIME HE HAD BEEN SURPRISED TO FIND HIS AMUSEMENT LOSE SOMETHING OF ITS ZEST
lbi-6455-67804-0031 IT'S DEUCEDLY BAD FORM ON HIS PART HE SAID MENTALLY WHAT DOES HE MEAN BY IT

lbi-6455-67804-0039 SHE BEGAN TO MOVE THE MANACLES ON HER RIGHT WRIST
lbi-6455-67804-0040 SHE HAD NOT BROUGHT LUCIA UP UNDER HER OWN EYE FOR NOTHING
lbi-6467-56885-0000 HIS BODY WAS LONG AND SLENDER HARD AND AGILE HIS SIGHT KEEN HIS AIM UNERRING

lbi-6467-56885-0002 ONE MORNING AS KANTI WAS SEATED IN HIS BOAT CLEANING A FAVOURITE GUN HE SUDDENLY STARTED AT WHAT HE THOUGHT WAS THE CRY OF WILD DUCK LOOKING UP HE SAW A VILLAGE MAIDEN COMING TO THE WATER'S EDGE WITH TWO WHITE DUCKLINGS CLASPED TO HER BREAST
lbi-6467-56885-0003 THE GIRL PUT THE BIRDS INTO THE WATER AND WATCHED THEM ANXIOUSLY
lbi-6467-56885-0004 LOOKING ROUND KANTI SAW ONE OF HIS MEN POINTING AN UNLOADED GUN AT THE DUCKS

lbi-6467-56885-0007 SO SAYING KANTI REPEATED HIS SALUTE AND WENT BACK
lbi-6467-56885-0008 THE BRICK BUILT MANSION OF THE MAZUMDARS HAD BEEN BORROWED FOR THE WEDDING CEREMONY WHICH WAS FIXED FOR NEXT MAGH AS KANTI DID NOT WISH TO DELAY
lbi-6467-56885-0009 IN DUE TIME THE BRIDEGROOM ARRIVED ON HIS ELEPHANT WITH DRUMS AND MUSIC AND WITH A TORCHLIGHT PROCESSION AND THE CEREMONY BEGAN
lbi-6467-56885-0010 IN THAT BASHFUL DOWNCAST FACE CROWNED WITH THE WEDDING CORONET AND BEDECKED WITH SANDAL PASTE HE COULD SCARCELY RECOGNISE THE VILLAGE MAIDEN OF HIS FANCY AND IN THE FULNESS OF HIS EMOTION A MIST SEEMED TO BECLOUD HIS EYES

lbi-6467-94831-0045 OH YOU CAN'T JOKE ME NO MORE
lbi-6467-97061-0000 ONE NIGHT WHEN BOTH WERE SLEEPING THE PRINCE HAD A REMARKABLE DREAM
lbi-6467-97061-0001 THEY RUSHED INTO THE ROOM ADDED THEIR CRIES TO HERS AND FORGETTING ALL THEIR FORMER PRECAUTIONS LEFT THE DOORS OPEN SO THAT THE GUARDS OUTSIDE HEARING THE CLAMOUR ENTERED AND SAW THE PRINCE
lbi-6467-97061-0002 SHE IS A DISGRACE TO HER FAMILY AND SHALL SOON SEE HER HUSBAND IMPALED ON A STAKE
lbi-6467-97061-0003 THEN WITH HIS FOREHEAD DISFIGURED BY A FEARFUL FROWN HE CONTINUED TO ABUSE THE PRINCE AND HAVING TIED HIS HANDS BEHIND HIM DRAGGED HIM FROM THE ROOM
lbi-6467-97061-0004 TREATED THUS LIKE SOME WILD BEAST ROUGHLY SHAKEN AND NEGLECTED RAJAVAHANA WOULD HAVE SUFFERED GREATLY HAD HE NOT BEEN PROTECTED BY THE MAGIC JEWEL GIVEN TO HIM IN PATALA AND WHICH HE HAD CONTRIVED TO CONCEAL IN HIS HAIR
lbi-6467-97061-0005 ADVANCING THEREFORE WITH A LARGE ARMY HE PREPARED TO BESIEGE CHAMPA THE CAPITAL CITY
lbi-6467-97061-0006 A TERRIBLE BATTLE ENSUED IN WHICH BOTH KINGS PERFORMED PRODIGIES OF VALOUR
lbi-6467-97061-0007 SHOULD THERE BE ANY PITY FOR THE VIOLATOR OF THE HAREM
lbi-6467-97061-0008 IF THE OLD KING MY FATHER NOW IN HIS DOTAGE WAS FOOLISH ENOUGH TO FAVOUR THE CRIMINAL FOR THE SAKE OF HIS WORTHLESS DAUGHTER YOU HAD NO NEED OF HIS PERMISSION AND OUGHT NOT TO HAVE BEEN INFLUENCED BY HIM
lbi-6467-97061-0009 LET THAT VILE SEDUCER BE IMMEDIATELY PUT TO DEATH BY TORTURE AND HIS PARAMOUR BE SHUT UP IN PRISON TILL I COME
lbi-6467-97061-0010 HAVE READY ALSO A FIERCE ELEPHANT SUITABLY EQUIPPED WHICH I SHALL MOUNT IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE WEDDING TO OVERTAKE MY ARMY IN MARCH AGAINST THE ENEMY AND AS I SET OUT I WILL MAKE THE ELEPHANT TRAMPLE THE LIFE OUT OF THAT CRIMINAL
lbi-6467-97061-0011 WHILE HE STOOD THERE CALMLY AWAITING DEATH WHICH NOW SEEMED INEVITABLE HE SUDDENLY FELT HIS FEET FREE AND A BEAUTIFUL LADY APPEARED BEFORE HIM
lbi-6467-97061-0012 SHE HUMBLY BOWING DOWN SAID LET MY LORD PARDON HIS SERVANT FOR THE INJURY WHICH SHE HAS UNCONSCIOUSLY CAUSED
lbi-6467-97061-0013 I AM AN APSARAS BORN FROM THE RAYS OF THE MOON
lbi-6467-97061-0014 ONE DAY AS I WAS FLYING THROUGH THE AIR WEARING A WHITE DRESS A SWAN MISTAKING ME FOR A LOTUS FLOWER ATTACKED ME
lbi-6467-97061-0015 IN HIS ANGER HE CURSED ME SAYING O WICKED ONE FOR THIS OFFENCE YOU ARE CONDEMNED TO BE CHANGED INTO A PIECE OF UNCONSCIOUS METAL
lbi-6467-97061-0016 THE CHANGE TOOK PLACE IMMEDIATELY AND I FELL TO THE GROUND TURNED INTO A SILVER CHAIN
lbi-6467-97061-0017 ON HIS WAY HE SAW THE SILVER FETTER DESCENDED TO THE GROUND PICKED IT UP AND CONTINUED HIS FLIGHT
lbi-6467-97061-0018 THE SLAYER OF CHANDAVARMA HEARING THIS CAME OUT OF THE PALACE AND QUICKLY MOUNTING THE ELEPHANT WHO HELD DOWN HIS TRUNK TO RECEIVE HIM PLACED HIMSELF BEHIND THE PRINCE
lbi-6467-97061-0019 GREAT WAS THEIR MUTUAL ASTONISHMENT AND JOY WHEN THEY RECOGNISED EACH OTHER THE PRINCE EXCLAIMING IS IT POSSIBLE
lbi-6467-97061-0020 IS IT REALLY YOU MY DEAR FRIEND APAHARAVARMA WHO HAVE DONE THIS DEED
lbi-6467-97061-0021 THROUGH THESE THEY FORCED THEIR WAY EMPLOYING WITH GOOD EFFECT THE WEAPONS PLACED ON THE ELEPHANT FOR THE USE OF CHANDAVARMA
lbi-6467-97061-0022 BEFORE HOWEVER THEY HAD GONE FAR THEY HEARD THE NOISE OF BATTLE AT A DISTANCE AND SAW THE SOLDIERS IN FRONT OF THEM SCATTERED IN ALL DIRECTIONS
lbi-6467-97061-0023 WE HAVE JUST NOW ENCOUNTERED AND UTTERLY DEFEATED THE ENEMY SO THAT THERE IS NO FEAR OF ANY FURTHER RESISTANCE
lbi-6467-97061-0024 RAJAVAHANA AGREED TO THIS
lbi-6599-38590-0000 WHATEVER HAND IT WAS THAT SHOT DOWN BOURBON ROME AFTER HIS DEATH WAS PLUNDERED DEVASTATED AND RAVAGED BY A BRUTAL GREEDY LICENTIOUS AND FANATICAL SOLDIERY
lbi-6599-38590-0001 WHEREFORE FOR THE FUTURE WRITE US NOTHING AT ALL BUT APPOINT US THE TIME AND PLACE OF MEETING AND WE WILL BRING OUR SWORD FOR YOU TO CROSS PROTESTING THAT THE SHAME OF ANY DELAY IN FIGHTING SHALL BE YOURS SEEING THAT WHEN IT COMES TO AN ENCOUNTER THERE IS AN END OF ALL WRITING

lbi-6599-38590-0008 THE PEACE OF CAMBRAI WAS CALLED THE LADIES PEACE IN HONOR OF THE TWO PRINCESSES WHO HAD NEGOTIATED IT THOUGH MORALLY DIFFERENT AND OF VERY UNEQUAL WORTH THEY BOTH HAD MINDS OF A RARE ORDER AND TRAINED TO RECOGNIZE POLITICAL NECESSITIES AND NOT TO ATTEMPT ANY BUT POSSIBLE SUCCESSES
lbi-6599-38590-0009 ALL THE GREAT POLITICAL ACTORS SEEMED HURRYING AWAY FROM THE STAGE AS IF THE DRAMA WERE APPROACHING ITS END
