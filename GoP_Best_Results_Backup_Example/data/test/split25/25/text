096310001	HE COULD BUT WHAT WOULD HE DO
096310002	SHE SMILED FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT DAY
096310003	THERE WAS SOMETHING IN FRONT OF HER
096310004	IT WILL ONLY BE A MOMENT
096310005	THE WOMAN LOOKED UP TO HIM
096310006	THIS IS ALL I CAN SAY
096310007	BUT THE EYES WERE RIGHT
096310008	HE TURNED HIS HEAD TO LOOK AT THEM
096310009	I HAVE BETTER GET OUT OF HERE
096310010	AND THEN THERE WAS HER FACE
096310011	HE ALWAYS SAW IF SHE WANTED HIM NOT TO
096310012	I THOUGHT MY LIFE WAS ABOUT TO END
096310013	WHAT WOULD THEY BE LIKE TO WORK WITH
096310014	NOW ARE YOU GOING TO LET ME GO
096310015	I PUT THEM BACK ON AND LEFT
096310016	THAT WAS AS MUCH AS HE WOULD GIVE HER
096310017	THEY OPENED IT AND WALKED IN
096310018	I THINK IT WILL DO US ALL SOME GOOD
096310019	THE THING HAD COME AND SO IT MUST BE
096310020	HE WAS NEVER EVEN IN THE ROOM
096330003	HE LOOKED AT HER AND TURNED AWAY
096330005	I WILL FIND THEM FOR YOU
096330006	IT WAS LIKE THEY WERE ONE PERSON
096330007	THERE ARE GOING TO BE MORE
096330008	YOU NEED TO COME WITH ME
096330009	I WOULD NEVER HAVE LEFT
096330010	THEY HAD TO GET OUT OF THERE
096330011	THIS WAS NOT IN HIS MIND
096330012	WE WERE THE SAME I OPENED MY EYES
096330013	BUT HOW CAN SHE TELL WHO IT WAS
096330014	I JUST WANT HER BACK
096330015	THE GIRL WALKED IN AND LOOKED AROUND
096330016	HE WAS ALWAYS UP TO NO GOOD
096330017	IT WAS ONLY ONE AFTER ALL I SAY
096330018	THAT DAY WAS THE FIRST TIME I SAW HIM
096330019	AS IF TO BE BUT A MAN WERE NOTHING
096330020	BUT THEN AGAIN THIS WAS HER HOUSE
096330021	HE WAS NOT HARD TO SEE FROM WHERE SHE WAS
096330022	I DO LOVE YOU AND I CAN MAKE THINGS RIGHT
096330023	IT WAS AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FRONT DOOR
096350006	THERE IS NO END TO THIS IS THERE
096350007	SHE WANTED TO KNOW MORE ABOUT HIM
096350008	IT SHOULD AS HE WAS ONE AFTER ALL
096350009	AND SHE WAS THE ONLY PERSON LEFT
096350010	THE OTHER AT THE BACK OF HIS HEAD
096350011	I WILL FIND OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON
096350012	HE ASKED IF I WOULD LIKE TO SEE MY FATHER
096350013	IT MADE ME WANT TO GET AWAY FROM HIM
096350014	I COULD NEVER GIVE YOU UP
096350015	IF IT BE SO I HAD BETTER GO
096350016	I PUT THEM ON AND I SAW WHERE WE WERE
096350018	I AM SURE YOU CAN DO IT
096350019	THEY ALL LOOK THE SAME TO YOU
096350020	AND YOU COME BEFORE THAT
096350021	BUT THEN I THOUGHT THERE WAS LITTLE NEED
096350023	BUT NOW I SEE WHO YOU REALLY ARE
096350024	IT WAS NOT HER PLACE TO SAY ANYTHING
096350025	I COULD FEEL HER EYES LOOKING AT ME
096350026	I LOOKED OVER TO THE SIDE
096350027	SHE TURNED TO FACE THE MAN
096400001	WAS IT POSSIBLE TO INTERPRET THEM TO ANY USEFUL PURPOSE
096400002	NOT A LIVING CREATURE WAS VISIBLE
096400004	AND AFTER HE LEFT I FEEL EMPTY
096400006	THE RECEIVER HAD NOT SUFFERED AT ALL
096400007	WE WILL TAKE TURNS IN WRITING EACH CHAPTER
096400008	DEATH SHOULD BE VEILED THE GRAVE SHOULD HAVE ITS RESERVE
096400010	THEY WERE SILVER WITH NO PUPIL
096400012	TOO LONG TOO SHORT TOO BORING
096400013	TROOPS ARE MARCHING INTO BATTLE
096400014	WAITING FOR WHAT SHE THOUGHT
096400016	HER EYES USUALLY SO GENTLE FLASHED FIRE
096400018	PLEASE FORGIVE ME MY FRIEND
096400019	THAT'S WHY WE BOTH PASSED OUT
096400020	AUTHOR NOTE HELLO AGAIN EVERYONE

096400022	ALL HEADS TURNED THEIR WAY
096400024	BUT THIS WANTS FARTHER EXPLANATION
096400025	MY OWN OWN DARLING DARLING DARLING JEWEL

096400028	IT'S ALMOST PAST YOUR BED TIME

096470004	THIS WAS LIKE STRIKING THEIR FLAG
096470005	BOTH GIRLS CALLED OUT AS THEY WATCHED HER LEAVE
096470007	WERE THESE YOUNG PEOPLE EVIL

096470010	IF THAT EVER HAPPENS THAT IS
096470011	NOTHING BUT AN IMMENSE SEA

096470022	HER MIND STARTED FORGETTING EVERYTHING
096470023	HIS HEAD HURT EVEN WORSE
