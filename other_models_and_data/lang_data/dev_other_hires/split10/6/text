lbi-4831-25894-0035 BEFORE THEY WENT HOME THE KIND MAMMA TOLD TESSA SHE SHOULD BE HER FRIEND AND GAVE HER A MOTHERLY KISS WHICH WARMED THE CHILD'S HEART AND SEEMED TO SET A SEAL UPON THAT PROMISE
lbi-4831-29134-0000 THE SENATOR TOOK HIS SEAT IN THE PULPIT WITH THE MINISTER ON ONE SIDE OF HIM AND THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE SUNDAY SCHOOL ON THE OTHER
lbi-4831-29134-0001 SO AWED WERE THEY BY THE PRESENCE OF A LIVING UNITED STATES SENATOR THAT DURING THREE MINUTES NOT A SPIT BALL WAS THROWN
lbi-4831-29134-0002 AFTER THAT THEY BEGAN TO COME TO THEMSELVES BY DEGREES AND PRESENTLY THE SPELL WAS WHOLLY GONE AND THEY WERE RECITING VERSES AND PULLING HAIR

lbi-4831-29134-0011 I HOPE YOU LOVE YOUR SUNDAY SCHOOL AH I SEE BY YOUR FACES THAT YOU DO THAT IS RIGHT
lbi-4831-29134-0012 ALWAYS LOVE YOUR TEACHERS MY CHILDREN FOR THEY LOVE YOU MORE THAN YOU CAN KNOW NOW
lbi-4831-29134-0013 AND BY AND BY THE PEOPLE MADE HIM GOVERNOR AND HE SAID IT WAS ALL OWING TO THE SUNDAY SCHOOL
lbi-4831-29134-0014 WHY THE PEOPLE GAVE HIM A TOWERING ILLUSTRIOUS POSITION A GRAND IMPOSING POSITION
lbi-4831-29134-0015 IT WAS SENATOR OF THE UNITED STATES
lbi-4831-29134-0016 THAT POOR LITTLE BOY THAT LOVED HIS SUNDAY SCHOOL BECAME THAT MAN THAT MAN STANDS BEFORE YOU
lbi-4831-29134-0017 ABOVE ALL THINGS MY CHILDREN BE HONEST
lbi-4831-29134-0018 WHEN SENATOR DILWORTHY DEPARTED FROM CATTLEVILLE HE LEFT THREE DOZEN BOYS BEHIND HIM ARRANGING A CAMPAIGN OF LIFE WHOSE OBJECTIVE POINT WAS THE UNITED STATES SENATE
lbi-5543-27761-0000 LELECHKA WAS A DELIGHTFUL CHILD
lbi-5543-27761-0001 THERE WAS NO OTHER SUCH CHILD THERE NEVER HAD BEEN AND THERE NEVER WOULD BE
lbi-5543-27761-0002 LELECHKA'S MOTHER SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA WAS SURE OF THAT
lbi-5543-27761-0003 LELECHKA'S EYES WERE DARK AND LARGE HER CHEEKS WERE ROSY HER LIPS WERE MADE FOR KISSES AND FOR LAUGHTER
lbi-5543-27761-0004 BUT IT WAS NOT THESE CHARMS IN LELECHKA THAT GAVE HER MOTHER THE KEENEST JOY
lbi-5543-27761-0005 SHE FELT COLD WITH HER HUSBAND
lbi-5543-27761-0006 HE WAS ALWAYS FRESH AND COOL WITH A FRIGID SMILE AND WHEREVER HE PASSED COLD CURRENTS SEEMED TO MOVE IN THE AIR
lbi-5543-27761-0007 IT EVEN SEEMED TO SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA THAT SHE WAS IN LOVE WITH HER FUTURE HUSBAND AND THIS MADE HER HAPPY
lbi-5543-27761-0008 THE BRIDE WAS ALSO GOOD LOOKING SHE WAS A TALL DARK EYED DARK HAIRED GIRL SOMEWHAT TIMID BUT VERY TACTFUL
lbi-5543-27761-0009 HE HAD CONNEXIONS AND HIS WIFE CAME OF GOOD INFLUENTIAL PEOPLE
lbi-5543-27761-0010 THIS MIGHT AT THE PROPER OPPORTUNITY PROVE USEFUL
lbi-5543-27761-0011 AFTER THEIR MARRIAGE THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE MANNER OF SERGEY MODESTOVICH TO SUGGEST ANYTHING WRONG TO HIS WIFE
lbi-5543-27761-0012 LATER HOWEVER WHEN HIS WIFE WAS ABOUT TO HAVE A CHILD SERGEY MODESTOVICH ESTABLISHED CONNEXIONS ELSEWHERE OF A LIGHT AND TEMPORARY NATURE
lbi-5543-27761-0013 SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA FOUND THIS OUT AND TO HER OWN ASTONISHMENT WAS NOT PARTICULARLY HURT SHE AWAITED HER INFANT WITH A RESTLESS ANTICIPATION THAT SWALLOWED EVERY OTHER FEELING
lbi-5543-27761-0014 SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA DRIFTED FARTHER AND FARTHER AWAY FROM HIM
lbi-5543-27761-0015 LELECHKA THEN RAN AWAY STAMPING WITH HER PLUMP LITTLE LEGS OVER THE CARPETS AND HID HERSELF BEHIND THE CURTAINS NEAR HER BED
lbi-5543-27761-0016 WHERE IS MY BABY GIRL THE MOTHER ASKED AS SHE LOOKED FOR LELECHKA AND MADE BELIEVE THAT SHE DID NOT SEE HER
lbi-5543-27761-0017 THEN SHE CAME OUT A LITTLE FARTHER AND HER MOTHER AS THOUGH SHE HAD ONLY JUST CAUGHT SIGHT OF HER SEIZED HER BY HER LITTLE SHOULDERS AND EXCLAIMED JOYOUSLY HERE SHE IS MY LELECHKA
lbi-5543-27761-0018 HER MOTHER'S EYES GLOWED WITH PASSIONATE EMOTION
lbi-5543-27761-0019 HER MOTHER WENT TO HIDE
lbi-5543-27761-0020 LELECHKA TURNED AWAY AS THOUGH NOT TO SEE BUT WATCHED HER MAMOCHKA STEALTHILY ALL THE TIME
lbi-5543-27761-0021 WHERE'S MY MAMOCHKA ASKED LELECHKA
lbi-5543-27761-0022 A SMILE OF ABSOLUTE BLISS PLAYED ON HER RED LIPS
lbi-5543-27761-0023 LELECHKA WAS GETTING NEARER HER MOTHER'S CORNER
lbi-5543-27761-0024 HER MOTHER WAS GROWING MORE ABSORBED EVERY MOMENT BY HER INTEREST IN THE GAME HER HEART BEAT WITH SHORT QUICK STROKES AND SHE PRESSED EVEN CLOSER TO THE WALL DISARRANGING HER HAIR STILL MORE
lbi-5543-27761-0025 LELECHKA SUDDENLY GLANCED TOWARD HER MOTHER'S CORNER AND SCREAMED WITH JOY
lbi-5543-27761-0026 THROUGH THE HALF CLOSED DOORS HE HEARD THE LAUGHTER THE JOYOUS OUTCRIES THE SOUND OF ROMPING
lbi-5543-27761-0027 EVEN FEDOSYA FELT ABASHED NOW FOR HER MISTRESS NOW FOR HERSELF
lbi-5543-27761-0028 HE LIKED COMING HERE WHERE EVERYTHING WAS BEAUTIFULLY ARRANGED THIS WAS DONE BY SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA WHO WISHED TO SURROUND HER LITTLE GIRL FROM HER VERY INFANCY ONLY WITH THE LOVELIEST THINGS
lbi-5543-27761-0029 SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA DRESSED HERSELF TASTEFULLY THIS TOO SHE DID FOR LELECHKA WITH THE SAME END IN VIEW
lbi-5543-27761-0030 ONE THING SERGEY MODESTOVICH HAD NOT BECOME RECONCILED TO AND THIS WAS HIS WIFE'S ALMOST CONTINUOUS PRESENCE IN THE NURSERY
lbi-5543-27761-0031 IT'S JUST AS I THOUGHT I KNEW THAT I'D FIND YOU HERE HE SAID WITH A DERISIVE AND CONDESCENDING SMILE
lbi-5543-27761-0032 MERELY YOU SEE THAT THE CHILD SHOULD FEEL ITS OWN INDIVIDUALITY HE EXPLAINED IN ANSWER TO SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA'S PUZZLED GLANCE
lbi-5543-27761-0033 SHE'S STILL SO LITTLE SAID SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA
lbi-5543-27761-0034 I DON'T INSIST IT'S YOUR KINGDOM THERE
lbi-5543-27761-0035 I'LL THINK IT OVER HIS WIFE ANSWERED SMILING AS HE DID COLDLY BUT GENIALLY
lbi-5543-27761-0036 THEN THEY BEGAN TO TALK OF SOMETHING ELSE
lbi-5543-27761-0037 THAT THE MISTRESS DOES IT WELL THAT'S ONE THING BUT THAT THE YOUNG LADY DOES IT THAT'S BAD
lbi-5543-27761-0038 WHY ASKED FEDOSYA WITH CURIOSITY
lbi-5543-27761-0039 THIS EXPRESSION OF CURIOSITY GAVE HER FACE THE LOOK OF A WOODEN ROUGHLY PAINTED DOLL
lbi-5543-27761-0040 YES THAT'S BAD REPEATED AGATHYA WITH CONVICTION TERRIBLY BAD WELL
lbi-5543-27761-0041 IT'S THE TRUTH I'M SAYING REMEMBER MY WORDS AGATHYA WENT ON WITH THE SAME ASSURANCE AND SECRECY
lbi-5543-27761-0042 IT'S THE SUREST SIGN
lbi-5543-27761-0043 THE OLD WOMAN HAD INVENTED THIS SIGN QUITE SUDDENLY HERSELF AND SHE WAS EVIDENTLY VERY PROUD OF IT
lbi-5543-27761-0044 MADAM MADAM SHE SAID QUIETLY IN A TREMBLING VOICE
lbi-5543-27761-0045 SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA GAVE A START
lbi-5543-27761-0046 FEDOSYA'S FACE MADE HER ANXIOUS
lbi-5543-27761-0047 WHAT IS IT FEDOSYA SHE ASKED WITH GREAT CONCERN IS THERE ANYTHING WRONG WITH LELECHKA
lbi-5543-27761-0048 NO MADAM SAID FEDOSYA AS SHE GESTICULATED WITH HER HANDS TO REASSURE HER MISTRESS AND TO MAKE HER SIT DOWN
lbi-5543-27761-0049 LELECHKA IS ASLEEP MAY GOD BE WITH HER
lbi-5543-27761-0050 ONLY I'D LIKE TO SAY SOMETHING YOU SEE LELECHKA IS ALWAYS HIDING HERSELF THAT'S NOT GOOD
lbi-5543-27761-0051 I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW BAD IT IS SAID FEDOSYA AND HER FACE EXPRESSED THE MOST DECIDED CONFIDENCE
lbi-5543-27761-0052 I UNDERSTAND NOTHING OF WHAT YOU ARE SAYING
lbi-5543-27761-0053 YOU SEE MADAM IT'S A KIND OF OMEN EXPLAINED FEDOSYA ABRUPTLY IN A SHAMEFACED WAY
lbi-5543-27761-0054 NONSENSE SAID SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA
lbi-5543-27761-0055 WHO TOLD YOU ALL THIS ASKED SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA IN AN AUSTERE LOW VOICE
lbi-5543-27761-0056 KNOWS EXCLAIMED SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA IN IRRITATION AS THOUGH SHE WISHED TO PROTECT HERSELF SOMEHOW FROM THIS SUDDEN ANXIETY
lbi-5543-27761-0057 WHAT NONSENSE AS THOUGH LELECHKA COULD DIE
lbi-5543-27761-0058 SHE SAW CLEARLY THAT THERE COULD BE NO POSSIBLE CONNEXION BETWEEN A CHILD'S QUITE ORDINARY DIVERSION AND THE CONTINUATION OF THE CHILD'S LIFE
lbi-5543-27761-0059 SHE MADE A SPECIAL EFFORT THAT EVENING TO OCCUPY HER MIND WITH OTHER MATTERS BUT HER THOUGHTS RETURNED INVOLUNTARILY TO THE FACT THAT LELECHKA LOVED TO HIDE HERSELF
lbi-5543-27761-0060 WHEN LELECHKA WAS STILL QUITE SMALL AND HAD LEARNED TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN HER MOTHER AND HER NURSE SHE SOMETIMES SITTING IN HER NURSE'S ARMS MADE A SUDDEN ROGUISH GRIMACE AND HID HER LAUGHING FACE IN THE NURSE'S SHOULDER
lbi-5543-27761-0061 THEN SHE WOULD LOOK OUT WITH A SLY GLANCE
lbi-5543-27761-0062 THOUGH SHE REPROACHED HERSELF AT ONCE FOR THIS UNFOUNDED SUPERSTITIOUS DREAD NEVERTHELESS SHE COULD NOT ENTER WHOLEHEARTEDLY INTO THE SPIRIT OF LELECHKA'S FAVOURITE GAME AND SHE TRIED TO DIVERT LELECHKA'S ATTENTION TO SOMETHING ELSE
lbi-5543-27761-0063 SHE EAGERLY COMPLIED WITH HER MOTHER'S NEW WISHES
lbi-5543-27761-0064 SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA TRIED DESPERATELY TO AMUSE LELECHKA
lbi-5543-27761-0065 PERHAPS THOUGHT SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA SHE IS NOT AS STRONGLY DRAWN TO THE WORLD AS OTHER CHILDREN WHO ARE ATTRACTED BY MANY THINGS
lbi-5543-27761-0066 IF THIS IS SO IS IT NOT A SIGN OF ORGANIC WEAKNESS
lbi-5543-27761-0067 SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA HERSELF BEGAN THE GAME ONCE OR TWICE THOUGH SHE PLAYED IT WITH A HEAVY HEART
lbi-5543-27761-0068 SHE SUFFERED AS THOUGH COMMITTING AN EVIL DEED WITH FULL CONSCIOUSNESS
lbi-5543-27761-0069 IT WAS A SAD DAY FOR SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA
lbi-5543-27761-0070 HER MOTHER COVERED HER WITH A BLUE BLANKET
lbi-5543-27761-0071 LELECHKA DREW HER SWEET LITTLE HANDS FROM UNDER THE BLANKET AND STRETCHED THEM OUT TO EMBRACE HER MOTHER HER MOTHER BENT DOWN
lbi-5543-27761-0072 SHE SEEMED SO SMALL AND SO FRAIL UNDER THE BLANKET THAT COVERED HER
lbi-5543-27761-0073 SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA REMAINED STANDING OVER LELECHKA'S BED A LONG WHILE AND SHE KEPT LOOKING AT LELECHKA WITH TENDERNESS AND FEAR
lbi-5543-27761-0074 I'M A MOTHER IS IT POSSIBLE THAT I SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO PROTECT HER SHE THOUGHT AS SHE IMAGINED THE VARIOUS ILLS THAT MIGHT BEFALL LELECHKA
lbi-5543-27761-0075 SHE PRAYED LONG THAT NIGHT BUT THE PRAYER DID NOT RELIEVE HER SADNESS
lbi-5543-27761-0076 SEVERAL DAYS PASSED LELECHKA CAUGHT COLD
lbi-5543-27761-0077 THE FEVER CAME UPON HER AT NIGHT
lbi-5543-27761-0078 WHEN SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA AWAKENED BY FEDOSYA CAME TO LELECHKA AND SAW HER LOOKING SO HOT SO RESTLESS AND SO TORMENTED SHE INSTANTLY RECALLED THE EVIL OMEN AND A HOPELESS DESPAIR TOOK POSSESSION OF HER FROM THE FIRST MOMENTS
lbi-5543-27761-0079 A DOCTOR WAS CALLED AND EVERYTHING WAS DONE THAT IS USUAL ON SUCH OCCASIONS BUT THE INEVITABLE HAPPENED
lbi-5543-27761-0080 AND LELECHKA GREW FEEBLER FROM HOUR TO HOUR
lbi-5543-27761-0081 NOTHING MADE HER SO UNHAPPY AS THE REITERATIONS OF FEDOSYA UTTERED BETWEEN SOBS SHE HID HERSELF AND HID HERSELF OUR LELECHKA
lbi-5543-27761-0082 FEVER WAS CONSUMING LELECHKA AND THERE WERE TIMES WHEN SHE LOST CONSCIOUSNESS AND SPOKE IN DELIRIUM
lbi-5543-27761-0083 THREE DAYS PASSED TORTURING LIKE A NIGHTMARE
lbi-5543-27761-0084 SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA HID HER FACE BEHIND THE CURTAINS NEAR LELECHKA'S BED HOW TRAGIC
lbi-5543-27761-0085 A WHITE MAMOCHKA WHISPERED LELECHKA
lbi-5543-27761-0086 MAMOCHKA'S WHITE FACE BECAME BLURRED AND EVERYTHING GREW DARK BEFORE LELECHKA
lbi-5543-27761-0087 SHE MET HER HUSBAND
lbi-5543-27761-0088 SERAFIMA AICKSANDROVNA WAS STANDING BY THE COFFIN AND LOOKING DULLY AT HER DEAD CHILD
lbi-5543-27761-0089 SIMA MY DEAR DON'T AGITATE YOURSELF SAID SERGEY MODESTOVICH IN A WHISPER
lbi-5543-27761-0090 YOU MUST RESIGN YOURSELF TO YOUR FATE
lbi-5543-27761-0091 SHE'LL BE UP IN A MINUTE PERSISTED SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA HER EYES FIXED ON THE DEAD LITTLE GIRL
lbi-5543-27761-0092 SERGEY MODESTOVICH LOOKED ROUND HIM CAUTIOUSLY HE WAS AFRAID OF THE UNSEEMLY AND OF THE RIDICULOUS
lbi-5543-27761-0093 SIMA DON'T AGITATE YOURSELF HE REPEATED
lbi-5543-27761-0094 HE WAS CONFUSED AND ANNOYED
lbi-5543-27761-0095 HER FACE SEEMED TRANQUIL AND HER EYES WERE DRY
lbi-5543-27761-0096 SHE WENT INTO THE NURSERY AND BEGAN TO WALK ROUND THE ROOM LOOKING INTO THOSE PLACES WHERE LELECHKA USED TO HIDE HERSELF
lbi-5543-27761-0097 SHE WALKED ALL ABOUT THE ROOM AND BENT NOW AND THEN TO LOOK UNDER THE TABLE OR UNDER THE BED AND KEPT ON REPEATING CHEERFULLY WHERE IS MY LITTLE ONE WHERE IS MY LELECHKA
lbi-5543-27761-0098 AFTER SHE HAD WALKED ROUND THE ROOM ONCE SHE BEGAN TO MAKE HER QUEST ANEW
lbi-5543-27761-0099 FEDOSYA MOTIONLESS WITH DEJECTED FACE SAT IN A CORNER AND LOOKED FRIGHTENED AT HER MISTRESS THEN SHE SUDDENLY BURST OUT SOBBING AND SHE WAILED LOUDLY
lbi-5543-27761-0100 SHE HID HERSELF AND HID HERSELF OUR LELECHKA OUR ANGELIC LITTLE SOUL
lbi-5543-27761-0101 WHEN SHE ENTERED THE PARLOUR THERE WERE SEVERAL PEOPLE BETWEEN HER AND LELECHKA
lbi-5543-27761-0102 THERE WAS AN OPPRESSIVE FEELING OF HEAVINESS IN SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA'S HEAD AS SHE APPROACHED LELECHKA
lbi-5543-27761-0103 LELECHKA LAY THERE STILL AND PALE AND SMILED PATHETICALLY
lbi-5543-27761-0104 THE LITTLE ONE DID NOT REPLY
lbi-5543-27761-0105 SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA STOOD UP ERECT SIGHED IN A LOST WAY SMILED AND CALLED LOUDLY LELECHKA
lbi-5543-27761-0106 LELECHKA WAS BEING CARRIED OUT
lbi-5849-50873-0000 CAPTAIN BULL THE COMMANDER OF A SMALL GARRISON AT SAYBROOK PERMITTED HIM TO LAND BUT WHEN THE GOVERNOR BEGAN TO READ HIS COMMISSION BULL ORDERED HIM TO BE SILENT
lbi-5849-50873-0001 WHAT HAS HAPPENED MISTER PRINCE WADSWORTH ASKED FOR HE COULD SEE THAT THE MAN WAS GREATLY EXCITED GOVERNOR ANDROS HAS COME AGAIN GASPED MISTER PRINCE WHY SHOULD THAT ALARM US THE FELLOW THOUGH GIVEN TO BOASTING IS NOT DANGEROUS OR LIABLE TO PUT HIS THREATS INTO EXECUTION BUT HE HAS GROWN DANGEROUS DECLARED MISTER PRINCE THE LIBERTIES OF THE COLONY ARE INVOLVED
lbi-5849-50873-0002 CAPTAIN WADSWORTH BECAME A LITTLE UNEASY THOUGH HE WAS STILL INCLINED TO TREAT THE MATTER LIGHTLY
lbi-5849-50873-0003 WE HAVE STUBBORNLY REFUSED TO YIELD OUR CHARTER VOLUNTARILY FOR IT IS THE GUARDIAN OF OUR POLITICAL RIGHTS
lbi-5849-50873-0004 THAT IS TRUE CAPTAIN WADSWORTH CONTINUED MISTER PRINCE AND TO SUBDUE OUR STUBBORNNESS THIS VICEROY HAS COME TO HARTFORD WITH SIXTY ARMED MEN TO DEMAND THE SURRENDER OF THE CHARTER IN PERSON
lbi-5849-50873-0005 CAPTAIN WADSWORTH BOUNDED TO HIS FEET IN A RAGE AND PLACING HIS HAND ON THE HILT OF HIS SWORD DECLARED HE SHALL NOT HAVE IT
lbi-5849-50873-0006 THE DAY WAS WELL NIGH SPENT WHEN HE ARRIVED AND THE MEMBERS WERE ENGAGED IN A HEATED DEBATE ON A SUBJECT OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE
lbi-5849-50873-0007 HE CONSENTED HOWEVER TO AWAIT THE DISCUSSION BUT AS SOON AS IT WAS ENDED HE DECLARED THAT HE WOULD HAVE THE CHARTER
lbi-5849-50873-0008 AFTER THE CAPTAIN HAD TAKEN TWO OR THREE TURNS ACROSS THE ROOM HE PAUSED AND ASKED
lbi-5849-50873-0009 WHAT IS THE ASSEMBLY DOING ENGAGED IN A DEBATE
lbi-5849-50873-0010 AND WILL HE WAIT UNTIL IT HAS ENDED HE HAS PROMISED TO DO SO
lbi-5849-50873-0011 MISTER PRINCE FIXED HIS AMAZED EYES ON THE CAPTAIN'S FACE AND READ THERE A DESPERATE DETERMINATION CAPTAIN HE BEGAN
lbi-5849-50873-0012 MISTER PRINCE BOWED AND HASTILY RETURNED TO THE HOUSE WHERE THE ASSEMBLY WAS IN SESSION
lbi-5849-50873-0013 AS SOON AS HE WAS GONE CHARLES STEVENS SAID
lbi-5849-50873-0014 YES CHARLES YOU WILL ANSWER WHAT DO YOU MEAN UNCLE
lbi-5849-50873-0015 NEVER DID DEBATERS TAKE GREATER INTEREST IN A MINOR SUBJECT
lbi-5849-50873-0016 WHAT DO YOU INTEND DOING UNCLE WILL YOU FIGHT THEM
lbi-5849-50873-0017 REMEMBER THE WORK MUST BE DONE RIGHT AT THE TIME NOT TOO SOON NOR TOO LATE
lbi-5849-50873-0018 THE SUN WAS SETTING AND THE CAPTAIN SAID
lbi-5849-50873-0019 COME CHARLES LET US HASTEN TO THE ASSEMBLY
lbi-5849-50873-0020 BY NO MEANS BUT I WANT YOU TO BE FULLY IMPRESSED WITH THE SERIOUSNESS OF YOUR MISSION
lbi-5849-50873-0021 TAKE YOUR PLACE CHARLES AND BE PREPARED TO DO YOUR PART WHISPERED CAPTAIN WADSWORTH
lbi-5849-50873-0022 CHARLES GOT AS CLOSE TO THE LONG TABLE USED BY THE SECRETARIES AS POSSIBLE WITHOUT ATTRACTING SPECIAL ATTENTION
lbi-5849-50873-0023 THE DISCUSSION WENT ON DARKNESS CAME AND FOUR LIGHTED CANDLES WERE PLACED ON THE TABLE AND TWO SET ON A SHELF ON THE WALL
lbi-5849-50873-0024 THOSE TWO CANDLES ON THE WALL WERE A GREAT ANNOYANCE TO CHARLES UNTIL HE SAW A MAN STATIONED NEAR THEM
lbi-5849-50873-0025 THOUGH THE LIGHTS WERE EXTINGUISHED THROUGH THE WINDOWS THE FAINT STARLIGHT DIMLY ILLUMINATED THE SCENE
lbi-5849-50873-0026 HE FOLLOWED HIM AS RAPIDLY AS HE COULD
lbi-5849-50873-0027 THE YOUTH WAS CLOSE BEHIND HIM AND WHEN THEY WERE OUTSIDE SEIZED HIS ARM
lbi-5849-50873-0028 BOY HAVE A CARE HOW YOU APPROACH ME
lbi-5849-50873-0029 THE SOLDIERS BEGAN TO CROWD ABOUT THE HOUSE WHEN AT A SIGNAL FROM CAPTAIN WADSWORTH THE TRAIN BANDS CAME ON THE SCENE AND PREPARED TO GRAPPLE WITH THE SOLDIERS
lbi-5849-50873-0030 WHERE IS THE CHARTER
lbi-5849-50873-0031 YOU HAVE YOUR SOLDIERS AT THE DOOR AND WE HAVE THE TRAIN BANDS OF CONNECTICUT READY TO DEFEND US AGAINST VIOLENCE
lbi-5849-50873-0032 WHO OF YOU HAS THE CHARTER
lbi-5849-50873-0033 IT WAS THE BOY CRIED THE ENRAGED GOVERNOR
lbi-5849-50873-0034 EVERY MEMBER OF THE ASSEMBLY SHOOK THEIR HEADS
lbi-5849-50873-0035 WE DO NOT KNOW HIM HE DOES NOT LIVE IN CONNECTICUT WHERE DOES HE LIVE
lbi-5849-50873-0036 LITTLE DID THE CAPTAIN OR HIS YOUTHFUL ASSISTANT DREAM THAT THEIR SIMPLE ACT WOULD MAKE THE OLD TREE HISTORIC
lbi-5849-50873-0037 THE TREE IN WHICH THE DOCUMENT WAS HIDDEN WAS EVER AFTERWARD KNOWN AS THE CHARTER OAK
lbi-5849-50873-0038 IT REMAINED VIGOROUS BEARING FRUIT EVERY YEAR UNTIL A LITTLE AFTER MIDNIGHT AUGUST EIGHTEEN FIFTY SIX WHEN IT WAS PROSTRATED BY A HEAVY STORM OF WIND
lbi-5849-50873-0039 WHEN THE ORDER FOR THE SEIZURE OF THE CHARTERS WAS FIRST MADE KNOWN THE ASSEMBLY OF RHODE ISLAND SENT A MOST LOYAL ADDRESS TO THE KING SAYING
lbi-5849-50873-0040 HE FORMALLY DISSOLVED THE ASSEMBLY BROKE THE SEAL OF THE COLONY WHICH BORE THE FIGURE OF AN ANCHOR AND THE WORD HOPE ADMITTED FIVE OF THE INHABITANTS INTO HIS LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL AND ASSUMED THE FUNCTIONS OF GOVERNOR BUT HE DID NOT TAKE AWAY THE PARCHMENT ON WHICH THE CHARTER WAS WRITTEN
lbi-5849-50873-0041 FROM THAT TIME UNTIL THE ENFORCED UNION OF THE COLONIES FOR MUTUAL DEFENCE AT THE BREAKING OUT OF THE FRENCH AND INDIAN WAR THE INHABITANTS OF RHODE ISLAND BORE THEIR SHARE IN THE DEFENSIVE EFFORTS ESPECIALLY WHEN THE HOSTILE SAVAGES HUNG ALONG THE FRONTIERS OF NEW YORK LIKE AN ILL OMENED CLOUD
lbi-5849-50873-0042 THE HISTORY OF THAT COMMONWEALTH IS IDENTIFIED WITH THAT OF ALL NEW ENGLAND FROM THE BEGINNING OF KING WILLIAM'S WAR SOON AFTER TO THE EXPULSION OF ANDROS
