096180001	AND SHE WAS INTIMATE WITH HIM AS AT FIRST
096180002	IT IS OVER IN A MOMENT
096180004	THEY WERE ON MY SIDE OF THE STREAM NOW
096180005	HE COULD NEVER SEE HER BEFORE
096180007	YOU STILL NEED TO GET OUT OF THIS PLACE
096180008	WHAT DO YOU THINK WHAT CAN BE THERE
096180009	THERE WAS A MAN BEHIND ME
096180010	THAT WAS JUST HOW SHE WAS
096180011	THIS IS THE WAY OF LIFE
096180012	AS IF SHE HAD SOMETHING ON HER MIND
096180013	I WANTED TO FIND MORE OUT ABOUT YOU
096180014	I ALWAYS THOUGHT HE WAS A GOOD PERSON
096180015	WE COULD PUT YOU IN A WORLD OF HURT
096180016	BUT NOT VERY LONG WAS SHE LEFT IN DOUBT
096180017	SHE LET GO OF HIS HAND AND RUBBED HER EYES
096180018	I JUST WANT TO SEE HER SAFE IN YOUR HANDS
096180019	BUT HERE IT IS THAT I MUST MAKE MY CONFESSION
096180020	AND THEN THERE WAS AN END OF IT
096180021	I ASKED NOT EVEN LOOKING UP AT HIM
096180022	HE HAD CALLED THEM THAT HIMSELF IN HIS DAY
096220001	YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT AND YOU ALWAYS WILL BE
096220002	HE LOOKED BACK AT ME
096220003	SHE THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT
096220004	THERE WAS NO ONE ELSE SHE WANTED BY HER SIDE
096220005	BUT WHAT IF WHAT THEY WERE DOING WAS RIGHT
096220006	IT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM BEFORE
096220007	I AM NOT GOING OUT WITH YOU
096220008	THIS WAS NO TIME TO THINK ABOUT THE REAL WORLD
096220009	I TURNED TO FACE THEM
096220010	BUT IT CAN DO SO MUCH MORE THAN THAT
096220011	THEN THEY WERE AT THE SAME THING AGAIN
096220012	HE CLOSED HIS EYES AS HE WALKED
096220013	I ASKED IF THEY WERE IN A FIGHT OR SOMETHING
096220014	NO NO HE WAS TOO GOOD A WORKMAN FOR THAT
096220015	HE PUT HER DOWN AND PATTED HER ON THE HEAD
096220016	WE WOULD HAVE TO FIND SOME WAY OF HIDING IT
096220017	I HAD LEFT IT BEHIND
096220018	SHE TURNED AWAY WITH A LITTLE WAVE OF THE HAND
096220019	BUT LOOK AT YOU TWO
096220020	WHAT WAS HE LIKE IN PERSON
096230001	HE LOOKED AT ME AND SMILED AND I SMILED BACK
096230002	SHE WANTED TO GET OUT
096230004	IT WAS JUST A PERSON
096230005	THIS WAS WHERE SHE HAD LEFT THEM
096230006	THERE WAS NO NEED FOR HIM TOO
096230007	WHAT WOULD IT BE LIKE THEN
096230008	THE TIME OF THE DAY
096230009	I COULD NOW SEE INTO HIS FACE
096230010	AND I NEVER THOUGHT A THING
096230011	THEY STOPPED AND HE WAS LET GO
096230012	I LOOK DOWN AND KNOW THE MAN IS DEAD
096230013	HOW LONG WAS HE GOING TO BE HERE
096230014	THERE WAS NOTHING IN IT FROM SIDE TO SIDE
096230015	THEN SHE TURNED TO ALL OF US
096230016	THAT WOULD MEAN THEY WOULD HAVE TO TAKE IT OVER
096230017	I WAS TIRED AND HAD OTHER THINGS ON MY MIND
096230018	WE MUST THINK OF THE GOOD AND NOT THE EVIL
096230019	NO IT WAS THE EYES
096230020	HE PUT HIS HAND ON THE KNOB AND OPENED IT
096230021	I STILL HAD NO IDEA WHO HE WAS
096260002	I LOOKED OVER AT HIM
096260003	IT WAS JUST YOU LAST TIME
096260004	THERE IS NO WAY I CAN GET BY THIS
096260005	BUT HOW WOULD THEY GO ABOUT IT
096260006	THEY ALL SMILED AT THE WORLD AROUND THEM
096260007	YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO COME WITH US NOW
096260008	NOW THERE WAS ONLY ONE THING LEFT TO DO
096260009	HE THEN WALKED FROM THERE OUT OF THAT ROOM
096260011	HE HAD NOTHING BUT THIS PLACE
096260012	HE STILL COULD NOT SEE ANYTHING
096260013	WE HAD TO MAKE IT
096260014	I NEED TO BE HERE
096260015	I SEEMED TO BE THE FIRST ONE DOWN
096260016	I HAD TO FIND A DIFFERENT BACK DOOR
096260017	HE HAD NO IDEA WHAT PEOPLE WOULD SAY
096260018	I PUT MY HAND ON IT
096260019	IT WAS TOO DARK TO SEE WHO IT WAS
096260020	THAT ALL I CAN EVER BE
096260021	AND THERE WAS AN END OF IT
096260022	HE WAS MORE THAN JUST A FATHER
096290001	HE WAS GOING TO HELP HIM
096290002	WHAT I DO KNOW IS THIS
096290004	SHE SMILED AT THE TIME
096290005	THEN IT WOULD ALL BE OVER
096290006	THAT HE COULD HAVE A HOME AGAIN
096290007	THERE WAS ONE RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME
096290008	BUT THEY WERE TURNED TO HIS LEFT
096290009	I THOUGHT FOR SURE SHE WOULD SAY SOMETHING
096290010	I WALKED UP TO MY ROOM
096290011	I CAN GET HER BACK
096290012	THE BOY LOOKED FROM THE HAND TO HER
096290014	HE SAW THE DAY WHEN IT HAD ALL HAPPENED
096290015	SHE ASKED LOOKING UP AT ME
096290016	I MADE IT TO HER HOUSE
096290017	I WAS STILL FOR A MOMENT
096290018	THIS WAS THE WAY IT SHOULD ALWAYS BE
096290020	SHE STOPPED WHERE SHE WAS AND LOOKED AROUND
096290021	AND THE FIRST THOUGH IN MY HEAD WAS
096290022	AND THAT WAS THE LAST I EVER SAW OF HIM
096290023	IT WAS NOT YET TIME
