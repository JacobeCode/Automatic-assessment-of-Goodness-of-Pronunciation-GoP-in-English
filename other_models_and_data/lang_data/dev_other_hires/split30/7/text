lbi-1686-142278-0000 HE WAS GONE
lbi-1686-142278-0001 NO MORE DEEP BLUE SKIES OR CRIMSON AND AMBER TINTS
lbi-1686-142278-0002 SHE SAT BY HERSELF AT THE FIRE WITH UNLIGHTED CANDLES ON THE TABLE BEHIND HER THINKING OVER THE DAY THE HAPPY WALK HAPPY SKETCHING CHEERFUL PLEASANT DINNER AND THE UNCOMFORTABLE MISERABLE WALK IN THE GARDEN
lbi-1686-142278-0003 HERE WAS SHE DISTURBED AND UNHAPPY BECAUSE HER INSTINCT HAD MADE ANYTHING BUT A REFUSAL IMPOSSIBLE WHILE HE NOT MANY MINUTES AFTER HE HAD MET WITH A REJECTION OF WHAT OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN THE DEEPEST HOLIEST PROPOSAL OF HIS LIFE COULD SPEAK AS IF BRIEFS SUCCESS AND ALL ITS SUPERFICIAL CONSEQUENCES OF A GOOD HOUSE CLEVER AND AGREEABLE SOCIETY WERE THE SOLE AVOWED OBJECTS OF HIS DESIRES OH DEAR
lbi-1686-142278-0004 HER MOTHER CAME INTO THE ROOM BEFORE THIS WHIRL OF THOUGHTS WAS ADJUSTED INTO ANYTHING LIKE ORDER
lbi-1686-142278-0005 MISTER HALE SIPPED HIS TEA IN ABSTRACTED SILENCE MARGARET HAD THE RESPONSES ALL TO HERSELF
lbi-1686-142278-0006 SHE FORGOT THAT HE HAD NOT MADE THEM AN OFFER
lbi-1686-142278-0007 MARGARET WAS PREPARING HER MOTHER'S WORSTED WORK AND RATHER SHRINKING FROM THE THOUGHT OF THE LONG EVENING AND WISHING BED TIME WERE COME THAT SHE MIGHT GO OVER THE EVENTS OF THE DAY AGAIN
lbi-1686-142278-0008 MARGARET
lbi-1686-142278-0009 I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING VERY SERIOUS TO US ALL
lbi-1686-142278-0010 VERY SERIOUS TO US ALL
lbi-1686-142278-0011 MISTER LENNOX HAD NEVER HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF HAVING ANY PRIVATE CONVERSATION WITH HER FATHER AFTER HER REFUSAL OR ELSE THAT WOULD INDEED BE A VERY SERIOUS AFFAIR
lbi-1686-142278-0012 BUT SHE SOON FELT IT WAS NOT ABOUT ANYTHING WHICH HAVING ONLY LATELY AND SUDDENLY OCCURRED COULD HAVE GIVEN RISE TO ANY COMPLICATED THOUGHTS THAT HER FATHER WISHED TO SPEAK TO HER
lbi-1686-142278-0013 MISTER HALE DID NOT ANSWER FOR A MINUTE OR TWO
lbi-1686-142278-0014 MARGARET COULD NOT BEAR THE SIGHT OF THE SUSPENSE WHICH WAS EVEN MORE DISTRESSING TO HER FATHER THAN TO HERSELF
lbi-1686-142278-0015 BUT WHY DEAR PAPA DO TELL ME
lbi-1686-142278-0016 BECAUSE I MUST NO LONGER BE A MINISTER IN THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND
lbi-1686-142278-0017 BUT NOTHING TO THE SHOCK SHE RECEIVED FROM MISTER HALE'S LAST SPEECH WHAT COULD HE MEAN
lbi-1686-142278-0018 IT WAS ALL THE WORSE FOR BEING SO MYSTERIOUS
lbi-1686-142278-0019 WHY CAN YOU NO LONGER BE A CLERGYMAN
lbi-1686-142278-0020 SURELY IF THE BISHOP WERE TOLD ALL WE KNOW ABOUT FREDERICK AND THE HARD UNJUST
lbi-1686-142278-0021 MARGARET I WILL TELL YOU ABOUT IT
lbi-1686-142278-0022 I WILL ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THIS ONCE BUT AFTER TO NIGHT LET US NEVER SPEAK OF IT AGAIN
lbi-1686-142278-0023 I CAN MEET THE CONSEQUENCES OF MY PAINFUL MISERABLE DOUBTS BUT IT IS AN EFFORT BEYOND ME TO SPEAK OF WHAT HAS CAUSED ME SO MUCH SUFFERING
lbi-1686-142278-0024 NO NOT DOUBTS AS TO RELIGION NOT THE SLIGHTEST INJURY TO THAT HE PAUSED
lbi-1686-142278-0025 MARGARET SIGHED AS IF STANDING ON THE VERGE OF SOME NEW HORROR
lbi-1686-142278-0026 MARGARET HOW I LOVE THE HOLY CHURCH FROM WHICH I AM TO BE SHUT OUT
lbi-1686-142278-0027 HE COULD NOT GO ON FOR A MOMENT OR TWO
lbi-1686-142278-0028 MARGARET COULD NOT TELL WHAT TO SAY IT SEEMED TO HER AS TERRIBLY MYSTERIOUS AS IF HER FATHER WERE ABOUT TO TURN MAHOMETAN
lbi-1686-142278-0029 THE ONE STAID FOUNDATION OF HER HOME OF HER IDEA OF HER BELOVED FATHER SEEMED REELING AND ROCKING
lbi-1686-142278-0030 HE SWALLOWED DOWN THE DRY CHOKING SOBS WHICH HAD BEEN HEAVING UP FROM HIS HEART HITHERTO AND GOING TO HIS BOOKCASE HE TOOK DOWN A VOLUME WHICH HE HAD OFTEN BEEN READING LATELY AND FROM WHICH HE THOUGHT HE HAD DERIVED STRENGTH TO ENTER UPON THE COURSE IN WHICH HE WAS NOW EMBARKED
lbi-1686-142278-0031 LISTEN DEAR MARGARET SAID HE PUTTING ONE ARM ROUND HER WAIST
lbi-1686-142278-0032 WHEN GOD WILL NOT USE THEE IN ONE KIND YET HE WILL IN ANOTHER
lbi-1686-142278-0033 IF WHEN THOU ART CHARGED WITH CORRUPTING GOD'S WORSHIP FALSIFYING THY VOWS THOU PRETENDEST A NECESSITY FOR IT IN ORDER TO A CONTINUANCE IN THE MINISTRY
lbi-1686-142278-0034 AS HE READ THIS AND GLANCED AT MUCH MORE WHICH HE DID NOT READ HE GAINED RESOLUTION FOR HIMSELF AND FELT AS IF HE TOO COULD BE BRAVE AND FIRM IN DOING WHAT HE BELIEVED TO BE RIGHT BUT AS HE CEASED HE HEARD MARGARET'S LOW CONVULSIVE SOB AND HIS COURAGE SANK DOWN UNDER THE KEEN SENSE OF SUFFERING
lbi-1686-142278-0035 I HAVE BORNE LONG WITH SELF REPROACH THAT WOULD HAVE ROUSED ANY MIND LESS TORPID AND COWARDLY THAN MINE
lbi-1686-142278-0036 HE SHOOK HIS HEAD AS HE WENT ON
lbi-1686-142278-0037 MARGARET I TRIED TO DO IT I TRIED TO CONTENT MYSELF WITH SIMPLY REFUSING THE ADDITIONAL PREFERMENT AND STOPPING QUIETLY HERE STRANGLING MY CONSCIENCE NOW AS I HAD STRAINED IT BEFORE
lbi-1686-142278-0038 GOD FORGIVE ME
lbi-1686-142278-0039 HE ROSE AND WALKED UP AND DOWN THE ROOM SPEAKING LOW WORDS OF SELF REPROACH AND HUMILIATION OF WHICH MARGARET WAS THANKFUL TO HEAR BUT FEW
lbi-1686-142278-0040 MARGARET I RETURN TO THE OLD SAD BURDEN WE MUST LEAVE HELSTONE
lbi-1686-142278-0041 YES
lbi-1686-142278-0042 I HAVE WRITTEN TO THE BISHOP I DARE SAY I HAVE TOLD YOU SO BUT I FORGET THINGS JUST NOW SAID MISTER HALE COLLAPSING INTO HIS DEPRESSED MANNER AS SOON AS HE CAME TO TALK OF HARD MATTER OF FACT DETAILS INFORMING HIM OF MY INTENTION TO RESIGN THIS VICARAGE
lbi-1686-142278-0043 THEY ARE BUT WHAT I HAVE TRIED UPON MYSELF WITHOUT AVAIL
lbi-1686-142278-0044 THAT WILL BE A TRIAL BUT WORSE FAR WORSE WILL BE THE PARTING FROM MY DEAR PEOPLE
lbi-1686-142278-0045 HE WILL COME TO STAY WITH US TO MORROW
lbi-1686-142278-0046 WAS IT TO BE SO SUDDEN THEN
lbi-1686-142278-0047 WHAT DOES MAMMA SAY
lbi-1686-142278-0048 MARGARET I AM A POOR COWARD AFTER ALL I CANNOT BEAR TO GIVE PAIN

lbi-1686-142278-0051 SHE WILL SHE MUST BE SHOCKED' AS THE FORCE OF THE BLOW RETURNED UPON HERSELF IN TRYING TO REALISE HOW ANOTHER WOULD TAKE IT
lbi-1686-142278-0052 TO MILTON NORTHERN HE ANSWERED WITH A DULL INDIFFERENCE FOR HE HAD PERCEIVED THAT ALTHOUGH HIS DAUGHTER'S LOVE HAD MADE HER CLING TO HIM AND FOR A MOMENT STRIVE TO SOOTHE HIM WITH HER LOVE YET THE KEENNESS OF THE PAIN WAS AS FRESH AS EVER IN HER MIND
lbi-1686-142278-0053 MILTON NORTHERN
lbi-1686-142278-0054 YES SAID HE IN THE SAME DESPONDENT INDIFFERENT WAY
lbi-1686-142278-0055 BUT HE WITH HIS QUICK INTUITIVE SYMPATHY READ IN HER FACE AS IN A MIRROR THE REFLECTIONS OF HIS OWN MOODY DEPRESSION AND TURNED IT OFF WITH AN EFFORT
lbi-1686-142278-0056 YOU SHALL BE TOLD ALL MARGARET

lbi-1686-142278-0060 MARGARET DID DISLIKE IT DID SHRINK FROM IT MORE THAN FROM ANYTHING SHE HAD EVER HAD TO DO IN HER LIFE BEFORE
lbi-1686-142278-0061 MISTER HALE SHOOK HIS HEAD DESPONDINGLY HE PRESSED HER HAND IN TOKEN OF GRATITUDE
lbi-1686-142278-0062 MARGARET WAS NEARLY UPSET AGAIN INTO A BURST OF CRYING
lbi-1686-142278-0063 TO TURN HER THOUGHTS SHE SAID NOW TELL ME PAPA WHAT OUR PLANS ARE

lbi-1686-142278-0071 I CANNOT STAND OBJECTIONS
lbi-1686-142278-0072 THEY MAKE ME SO UNDECIDED

lbi-1686-142278-0077 A PRIVATE TUTOR
lbi-1686-142278-0078 SAID MARGARET LOOKING SCORNFUL WHAT IN THE WORLD DO MANUFACTURERS WANT WITH THE CLASSICS OR LITERATURE OR THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF A GENTLEMAN

lbi-1686-142278-0081 AND IN MILTON MARGARET I SHALL FIND A BUSY LIFE IF NOT A HAPPY ONE AND PEOPLE AND SCENES SO DIFFERENT THAT I SHALL NEVER BE REMINDED OF HELSTONE

lbi-1701-141759-0021 SONYA SMILED NO

lbi-1701-141759-0026 THE COUNT PUT HIS EAR TO THE KEYHOLE AND LISTENED
lbi-1701-141759-0027 AT FIRST HE HEARD THE SOUND OF INDIFFERENT VOICES THEN ANNA MIKHAYLOVNA'S VOICE ALONE IN A LONG SPEECH THEN A CRY THEN SILENCE THEN BOTH VOICES TOGETHER WITH GLAD INTONATIONS AND THEN FOOTSTEPS
lbi-1701-141759-0028 ANNA MIKHAYLOVNA OPENED THE DOOR
lbi-1701-141759-0029 WHEN SHE HEARD THIS SONYA BLUSHED SO THAT TEARS CAME INTO HER EYES AND UNABLE TO BEAR THE LOOKS TURNED UPON HER RAN AWAY INTO THE DANCING HALL WHIRLED ROUND IT AT FULL SPEED WITH HER DRESS PUFFED OUT LIKE A BALLOON AND FLUSHED AND SMILING PLUMPED DOWN ON THE FLOOR
lbi-1701-141759-0030 THE COUNTESS WAS CRYING
