lbi-2428-83705-0000 HER FATHER IS A MOST REMARKABLE PERSON TO SAY THE LEAST
lbi-2428-83705-0001 BUT IT IS QUITE PLAIN TO ME THAT ALL THE ARRANGEMENTS FOR MY WEDDING ARE GOING TO BE MADE BY THE SNELLINGS
lbi-2428-83705-0002 I DO NOT KNOW WHEN IT IS GOING TO BE BUT IT WILL BE EITHER NEXT WEEK OR THE WEEK AFTER CERTAINLY AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE MOMENT AND I SHOULDN'T BE AT ALL SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT ALL MARY ANN'S THINGS HAD BEEN ALREADY BOUGHT AND PERHAPS SOME OF THEM MARKED
lbi-2428-83705-0003 IT IS MOST DELIGHTFUL
lbi-2428-83705-0004 IT MIGHT JUST AS WELL BE SOME ONE ELSE'S WEDDING SO UNIMPORTANT IS THE PART WHICH I AM SET TO PLAY IN IT
lbi-2428-83705-0005 FOR INSTANCE LOOK AT THEIR BEHAVIOUR IN THE MATTER OF THE RING
lbi-2428-83705-0006 THE ACCIDENT IN QUESTION OCCURRED UPON THE SUNDAY EVENING
lbi-2428-83705-0007 THE GIRL IS FRETTING BUT YOU DON'T SEEM TO NOTICE IT
lbi-2428-83705-0008 I GASPED POSITIVELY GASPED
lbi-2428-83705-0009 THAT'S IT ON YOUR ACCOUNT
lbi-2428-83705-0010 FROM A COUSIN OF OURS WHO'S IN THAT LINE
lbi-2428-83705-0011 I NEVER SAW PEOPLE LIKE THE SNELLINGS FOR POSSESSING RELATIVES IN ALL SORTS OF LINES
lbi-2428-83705-0012 I WAS PERSUADED THAT SOMEBODY BESIDES THAT COUSIN GOT A PROFIT OUT OF MARY ANN'S ENGAGEMENT RING BUT I HANDED OVER THE AMOUNT
lbi-2428-83705-0013 IT IS FROM HER ACTION IN THAT MATTER THAT MY SUSPICION SPRINGS
lbi-2428-83705-0014 THERE SHE OWNS A COTTAGE OR IT MAY BE A PIGSTYE FOR ALL I KNOW
lbi-2428-83705-0015 WHEN SHE HEARD OF MY ENGAGEMENT WITH MARY ANN SHE WROTE AND SUGGESTED THAT WE SHOULD SPEND OUR HONEYMOON IN HER COTTAGE OR PIGSTYE AND THAT I SHOULD PAY HER RENT FOR IT
lbi-2428-83705-0016 THERE WERE NO SIGNS OF FALTERING ABOUT HER FLOW OF LANGUAGE
lbi-2428-83705-0017 I FOUND THAT AS A WOMAN OF BUSINESS SHE WAS BEYOND ALL MY EXPECTATIONS
lbi-2428-83705-0018 IT TURNED OUT THAT SHE HAD A LITTLE MONEY OF HER OWN ABOUT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY POUNDS A YEAR
lbi-2428-83705-0019 AND OF COURSE I HAD MY EXPECTATIONS AND SHE HAD HERS
lbi-2428-83705-0020 IT WAS PLAIN THAT TOGETHER WE SHOULD MANAGE MOST COMFORTABLY DELIGHTFULLY IN FACT
lbi-2428-83705-0021 I SHALL MAKE PAPA GIVE ME FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS AT LEAST
lbi-2428-83705-0022 A BIRD IN THE HAND IS WORTH TWO IN A BUSH' AND IT WILL BE SOMETHING TO HAVE BY US
lbi-2428-83705-0023 I KNOW WHAT MAMMA CAN AFFORD TO GIVE AND I WILL SEE SHE GIVES IT
lbi-2428-83705-0024 AND I WILL SEE THAT THERE IS NO SHIRKING ABOUT THE BOYS OR ABOUT THE GIRLS EITHER
lbi-2428-83705-0025 I HAVE DRAWN UP A LIST OF ALL THE PEOPLE WHO OUGHT TO GIVE US A PRESENT AND I SHALL TELL THEM WHAT THEY OUGHT TO GIVE IT WON'T BE MY FAULT IF I DON'T GET IT
lbi-2428-83705-0026 OF COURSE THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WITH WHOM YOU CAN'T BE PERFECTLY PLAIN BUT I SHALL BE AS PLAIN AS I CAN THERE'S A WAY AND A MANNER OF DOING THAT KIND OF THING
lbi-2428-83705-0027 HERS HAS BEEN PRODIGIOUS
lbi-2428-83705-0028 SHE HAS A KNACK OF GETTING PEOPLE TO DO WHAT SHE WISHES AND TO GIVE HER WHAT SHE WANTS WHICH IS A LITTLE SHORT OF MIRACULOUS
lbi-2428-83705-0029 I NOTICE THAT THEY ARE GENERALLY PERSONS WHO HAVE ALREADY TENDERED THEIR OFFERINGS
lbi-2428-83705-0030 THE FACT OF HAVING GIVEN MARY ANN A WEDDING PRESENT SEEMS TO FILL THEM WITH A FEELING OF RANCOROUS ACIDITY WHICH TO ME IS INEXPLICABLE
lbi-2428-83705-0031 SUCH IS THE SELFISHNESS OF HUMAN NATURE
lbi-2428-83705-0032 BUT WHY ON THAT ACCOUNT THEY SHOULD PITY ME I ALTOGETHER FAIL TO UNDERSTAND
lbi-2428-83705-0033 WE HAVE ALL BEEN GIVING MARY ANN PRESENTS AND I SUPPOSE YOU MISTER WHITING HAVE BEEN GIVING HER SOMETHING TOO
lbi-2428-83705-0034 THAT WAS WHAT MISSUS MACPHERSON SAID TO ME ONLY THE OTHER DAY
lbi-2428-83705-0035 AND WHAT INQUIRED MISSUS MACPHERSON HAS MARY ANN GIVEN YOU HER LOVE
lbi-2428-83705-0036 SOMEONE SNIGGERED
lbi-2428-83705-0037 I CANNOT PRETEND TO EXPLAIN WHY EXCEPT ON THE SUPPOSITION THAT ROMANCE IS DEAD AT LEAST IN THAT CIRCLE OF SOCIETY IN WHICH THE SNELLINGS MOVE
lbi-2428-83705-0038 AS IT IS UNLESS I AM MISTAKEN SOME OF THE RENDING WILL BE ON OUR SIDE AND THEY KNOW IT
lbi-2428-83705-0039 P S THE CARDS ARE OUT FOR THE WEDDING
lbi-2428-83705-0040 WE ARE GOING FOR OUR HONEYMOON TO ITALY AND THE SOUTH OF FRANCE
lbi-2428-83705-0041 A SECOND COUSIN OF MARY ANN'S IS IN THE COOK'S TOURS LINE
lbi-2428-83705-0042 HE HAS GIVEN US FREE PASSES ALL THE WAY TO THE END OF OUR JOURNEY AND ALL THE WAY BACK AGAIN AND COUPONS FOR FREE BOARD AND LODGING AT THE HOTEL IT'S A WEDDING PRESENT
lbi-2428-83705-0043 BESIDES WHICH WE CAN ALWAYS SELL THE COUPONS AND RAILWAY PASSES WHICH WE DON'T USE
lbi-251-118436-0000 HE WAS YOUNG NO SPEAR HAD TOUCHED HIM NO POISON LURKED IN HIS WINE
lbi-251-118436-0001 I TELL YOU IT IS NOT POISON SHE CRIED
lbi-251-118436-0002 SINCE HIS BIRTH HE HAS BEEN GUARDED SO CLOSELY THAT THE CLEVEREST POISONERS OF THE EAST COULD NOT REACH HIM
lbi-251-118436-0003 AS YOU WELL KNOW THERE ARE TEN MEN AND TEN WOMEN WHOSE SOLE DUTY IS TO TASTE HIS FOOD AND WINE AND FIFTY ARMED WARRIORS GUARD HIS CHAMBER AS THEY GUARD IT NOW
lbi-251-118436-0004 A LOW CONFUSED MOAN WANED FROM HIS MOUTH
lbi-251-118436-0005 THE MAN SHRUGGED HIS BROAD SHOULDERS AND TURNED BACK INTO THE ARABESQUE CHAMBER
lbi-251-118436-0006 THIS MAN WAS CLAD IN A BROWN CAMEL HAIR ROBE AND SANDALS AND A GREEN TURBAN WAS ON HIS HEAD
lbi-251-118436-0007 NOT UNTIL THE HEAVENS WERE IN THE PROPER ORDER COULD THEY PERFORM THIS NECROMANCY
lbi-251-118436-0008 WITH A LONG STAINED FINGERNAIL HE MAPPED THE CONSTELLATIONS ON THE MARBLE TILED FLOOR
lbi-251-118436-0009 THE SLANT OF THE MOON PRESAGED EVIL FOR THE KING OF VENDHYA THE STARS ARE IN TURMOIL THE SERPENT IN THE HOUSE OF THE ELEPHANT
lbi-251-118436-0010 POINT OF CONTACT INQUIRED THE OTHER
lbi-251-118436-0011 ALL DISCARDED PORTIONS OF THE HUMAN BODY STILL REMAIN PART OF IT ATTACHED TO IT BY INTANGIBLE CONNECTIONS
lbi-251-118436-0012 BUT AT THE URGENT ENTREATY OF THE PRINCESS OF KHOSALA WHO LOVED BHUNDA CHAND VAINLY HE GAVE HER A LOCK OF HIS LONG BLACK HAIR AS A TOKEN OF REMEMBRANCE
lbi-251-118436-0013 BY WHICH A SOUL IS DRAWN FROM ITS BODY AND ACROSS GULFS OF ECHOING SPACE RETURNED THE MAN ON THE MAT
lbi-251-118436-0014 ON THE DAIS UNDER THE GOLDEN DOME THE KING CRIED OUT AGAIN RACKED BY AWFUL PAROXYSMS
lbi-251-118436-0015 THEY SEEK TO SNAP THE SILVER CORD THAT BINDS ME TO MY DYING BODY
lbi-251-118436-0016 THEY CLUSTER AROUND ME THEIR HANDS ARE TALONED THEIR EYES ARE RED LIKE FLAME BURNING IN DARKNESS
lbi-251-118436-0017 THEIR FINGERS SEAR ME LIKE FIRE
lbi-251-118436-0018 I KNOW NOW WHAT BRINGS ME TO THE PYRE
lbi-251-118436-0019 THERE THEY STROVE TO BREAK THE SILVER CORD OF LIFE AND THRUST MY SOUL INTO THE BODY OF A FOUL NIGHT WEIRD THEIR SORCERY SUMMONED UP FROM HELL AH
lbi-251-118436-0020 YOUR CRY AND THE GRIP OF YOUR FINGERS BROUGHT ME BACK BUT I AM GOING FAST
lbi-251-118436-0021 THERE WAS THE OLD IMPERIOUS NOTE IN HIS FAILING WHISPER
lbi-251-118436-0022 YOU HAVE NEVER DISOBEYED ME OBEY MY LAST COMMAND
lbi-251-118436-0023 SEND MY SOUL CLEAN TO ASURA
lbi-251-136532-0000 THEY ALSO FOUND A MARTIAN CALENDAR THE YEAR HAD BEEN DIVIDED INTO TEN MORE OR LESS EQUAL MONTHS AND ONE OF THEM HAD BEEN DOMA
lbi-251-136532-0001 BILL CHANDLER THE ZOOLOGIST HAD BEEN GOING DEEPER AND DEEPER INTO THE OLD SEA BOTTOM OF SYRTIS
lbi-251-136532-0002 THAT TOOK THE CENTER OF INTEREST AWAY FROM ARCHAEOLOGY AND STARTED A NEW BURST OF ACTIVITY
lbi-251-136532-0003 THE CIVILIAN SPECIALISTS IN OTHER FIELDS AND THE SPACE FORCE PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN HOLDING TAPE LINES AND MAKING SKETCHES AND SNAPPING CAMERAS WERE ALL FLYING TO LOWER SYRTIS TO FIND OUT HOW MUCH OXYGEN THERE WAS AND WHAT KIND OF LIFE IT SUPPORTED
lbi-251-136532-0004 THEY HAD FOUR OR FIVE SPECIES OF WHAT MIGHT LOOSELY BE CALLED BIRDS AND SOMETHING THAT COULD EASILY BE CLASSED AS A REPTILE AND A CARNIVOROUS MAMMAL THE SIZE OF A CAT WITH BIRDLIKE CLAWS AND A HERBIVORE ALMOST IDENTICAL WITH THE PIGLIKE THING IN THE BIG DARFHULVA MURAL AND ANOTHER LIKE A GAZELLE WITH A SINGLE HORN IN THE MIDDLE OF ITS FOREHEAD
lbi-251-136532-0005 THE DAILY NEWSCASTS FROM TERRA SHOWED A CORRESPONDING SHIFT IN INTEREST AT HOME
lbi-251-136532-0006 TONY'S FOUND THE MARTIANS
lbi-251-136532-0007 IT WAS LOCKED FROM THE INSIDE AND WE HAD TO BURN IT DOWN WITH A TORCH THAT'S WHERE THEY ARE
lbi-251-136532-0008 GLORIA STANDISH WHO HAD DROPPED IN FOR LUNCH WAS ON THE MEZZANINE FAIRLY SCREAMING INTO A RADIOPHONE EXTENSION DOZEN AND A HALF OF THEM
lbi-251-136532-0009 WELL OF COURSE THEY'RE DEAD WHAT A QUESTION
lbi-251-136532-0010 MARTHA REMEMBERED THE CLOSED DOOR ON THE FIRST SURVEY THEY HADN'T ATTEMPTED OPENING IT
lbi-251-136532-0011 NOW IT WAS BURNED AWAY AT BOTH SIDES AND LAY STILL HOT ALONG THE EDGES ON THE FLOOR OF THE BIG OFFICE ROOM IN FRONT
lbi-251-136532-0012 A FLOODLIGHT WAS ON IN THE ROOM INSIDE AND LATTIMER WAS GOING AROUND LOOKING AT THINGS WHILE A SPACE FORCE OFFICER STOOD BY THE DOOR
lbi-251-136532-0013 MASS SUICIDE THAT'S WHAT IT WAS NOTICE WHAT'S IN THE CORNERS
lbi-251-136532-0014 YES CHARCOAL
lbi-251-136532-0015 SO THEY JUST CAME IN HERE AND LIT THE CHARCOAL AND SAT DRINKING TOGETHER TILL THEY ALL FELL ASLEEP
lbi-251-136532-0016 THE TERRAN PUBLIC WANTED TO HEAR ABOUT MARTIANS AND IF LIVE MARTIANS COULDN'T BE FOUND A ROOM FULL OF DEAD ONES WAS THE NEXT BEST THING
lbi-251-136532-0017 TONY LATTIMER THE DISCOVERER WAS BEGINNING TO CASH IN ON HIS ATTENTIONS TO GLORIA AND HIS INGRATIATION WITH SID HE WAS ALWAYS EITHER MAKING VOICE AND IMAGE TALKS FOR TELECAST OR LISTENING TO THE NEWS FROM THE HOME PLANET
lbi-251-136532-0018 WITHOUT QUESTION HE HAD BECOME OVERNIGHT THE MOST WIDELY KNOWN ARCHAEOLOGIST IN HISTORY
lbi-251-136532-0019 NOT THAT I'M INTERESTED IN ALL THIS FOR MYSELF HE DISCLAIMED AFTER LISTENING TO THE TELECAST FROM TERRA TWO DAYS AFTER HIS DISCOVERY
lbi-251-136532-0020 BRING IT TO THE PUBLIC ATTENTION DRAMATIZE IT
lbi-251-136532-0021 SO I BELIEVE I SHALL GO BACK AT LEAST FOR A WHILE AND SEE WHAT I CAN DO
lbi-251-136532-0022 LECTURES
lbi-251-136532-0023 THE ORGANIZATION OF A SOCIETY OF MARTIAN ARCHAEOLOGY WITH ANTHONY LATTIMER PH D THE LOGICAL CANDIDATE FOR THE CHAIR
lbi-251-137823-0000 I'LL BE GLAD TO TRY SIR HE REPLIED
lbi-251-137823-0001 INSIDE A SECRET ROCKET TELEMETERING DEVICE WAS MOUNTED ON ITS TEST STAND
lbi-251-137823-0002 THIS ISN'T PART OF YOUR TESTING ROUTINE IS IT
lbi-251-137823-0003 ANOTHER ENGINEER RUSHED TOWARD THE DOOR TO SEE WHAT WAS HAPPENING OUTSIDE
lbi-251-137823-0004 ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT CASCADED FROM THE WALL SHELVES AND A HEAVY DUTY CHAIN HOIST CAME LOOSE FROM ITS OVERHEAD TRACK PLUNGING TO THE FLOOR WITH A TERRIFYING CRASH
lbi-251-137823-0005 AN INSTANT LATER IT CRASHED OVER PINNING MARK FABER BENEATH IT
lbi-251-137823-0006 BUD THREW UP HIS ARMS TO PROTECT HIMSELF BUT TOO LATE
lbi-251-137823-0007 FOR MINUTES NO ONE STIRRED AMONG THE WRECKAGE
lbi-251-137823-0008 THEN TOM WHO HAD BEEN STUNNED BY SOME FALLING DEBRIS RAISED HIMSELF TO A SITTING POSITION
lbi-251-137823-0009 TOM'S EYES FOCUSED IN HORROR ON THE WRECKAGE ENVELOPED BY STILL BILLOWING DUST
lbi-251-137823-0010 THE SKY WAS VISIBLE THROUGH SEVERAL GAPING HOLES IN THE ROOF WHICH WAS SAGGING DANGEROUSLY ON ITS SUPPORTING TRUSSES
lbi-251-137823-0011 THE YOUNG INVENTOR HAD JUST NOTICED HIS FRIEND LYING PINNED BENEATH A HEAVY BEAM NEARBY
lbi-251-137823-0012 HIS FRIEND'S EYELIDS FLICKERED
lbi-251-137823-0013 WE'D BETTER NOT TRY TO MOVE HIM TOM DECIDED WE'LL GET AN AMBULANCE
lbi-251-137823-0014 THEY PICKED THEIR WAY THROUGH THE WRECKAGE AND EMERGED ON A SCENE OF FRIGHTFUL DESTRUCTION
lbi-251-137823-0015 LET'S SEE ABOUT GETTING HELP FOR MISTER FABER
lbi-251-137823-0016 AND THE ONLY TRUCK WE HAD AVAILABLE WAS IN THAT BURNING SHED THE SUPERINTENDENT ADDED BITTERLY
lbi-251-137823-0017 ANYHOW WE WANT TO HELP GOT A JOB FOR US
lbi-251-137823-0018 WITHIN MINUTES TOM WAS IN CHARGE OF CLEARING AWAY RUBBLE AND EXTRICATING ANYONE WHO MIGHT BE TRAPPED INSIDE THE BUILDINGS
lbi-251-137823-0019 THE TELEPHONE LINE WAS SOON REPAIRED AND A STEADY STREAM OF RESCUE VEHICLES BEGAN ARRIVING FROM HARKNESS FIRE TRUCKS THREE AMBULANCES AND PRIVATE CARS DRIVEN BY VOLUNTEERS
lbi-251-137823-0020 THE TWO GIRLS WERE AS MUCH UPSET AS TOM'S MOTHER TOM LAUGHED
lbi-251-137823-0021 MISTER SWIFT CAME INTO THE LIVING ROOM JUST THEN AND TOLD TOM HOW WORRIED MISSUS SWIFT AND SANDY HAD BEEN
lbi-251-137823-0022 HE SMILED GUILTILY AS HE ADDED BUT I MUST ADMIT I WAS MORE THAN A LITTLE CONCERNED MYSELF
lbi-251-137823-0023 HE'S A GREAT SCIENTIST
lbi-251-137823-0024 TOM NODDED UNHAPPILY
lbi-251-137823-0025 MALE OR FEMALE HUMAN OR ANIMAL
lbi-251-137823-0026 MISTER SWIFT'S EYES TWINKLED
lbi-2803-154320-0000 FORTUNATELY WILL HALLEY WAS NOT A MAN IN A HURRY AND DID NOT USE A PRESS OF CANVAS OR HIS MASTS WOULD INEVITABLY HAVE COME DOWN
lbi-2803-154320-0001 JOHN MANGLES THEREFORE HOPED THAT THE WRETCHED HULL WOULD REACH PORT WITHOUT ACCIDENT BUT IT GRIEVED HIM THAT HIS COMPANIONS SHOULD HAVE TO SUFFER SO MUCH DISCOMFORT FROM THE DEFECTIVE ARRANGEMENTS OF THE BRIG
lbi-2803-154320-0002 THEIR FRIENDS DID THEIR BEST TO AMUSE THEM
lbi-2803-154320-0003 THEIR MINDS WERE SO DISTRACTED AT THIS CHANGE OF ROUTE AS TO BE QUITE UNHINGED
lbi-2803-154320-0004 MUCH AS THEY HAD BEEN INTERESTED IN HIS DISSERTATION ON THE PAMPAS OR AUSTRALIA HIS LECTURES ON NEW ZEALAND FELL ON COLD AND INDIFFERENT EARS
lbi-2803-154320-0005 HIS EYES WANDERED CEASELESSLY OVER THE BLANK HORIZON
lbi-2803-154320-0006 WHAT THEN MY LORD
lbi-2803-154320-0007 GOD KEEP US FROM SUCH A MEETING WHY JOHN
lbi-2803-154320-0008 WE COULD NOT EVEN FLY FLY JOHN
lbi-2803-154320-0009 YES MY LORD WE SHOULD TRY IN VAIN
lbi-2803-154320-0010 WE WOULD FIGHT TO THE DEATH OF COURSE BUT AFTER THAT
lbi-2803-154320-0011 THINK OF LADY GLENARVAN THINK OF MARY GRANT
lbi-2803-154320-0012 WILL HALLEY IS A BRUTE BUT I AM KEEPING MY EYES OPEN AND IF THE COAST LOOKS DANGEROUS I WILL PUT THE SHIP'S HEAD TO SEA AGAIN
lbi-2803-154320-0013 SO THAT ON THAT SCORE THERE IS LITTLE OR NO DANGER
lbi-2803-154320-0014 BUT AS TO GETTING ALONGSIDE THE DUNCAN GOD FORBID
lbi-2803-154328-0000 THEY WERE NOT TO LEAVE IT AGAIN TILL THE TOPS OF THE WAHITI RANGES WERE LIT WITH THE FIRST FIRES OF DAY
lbi-2803-154328-0001 THEY HAD ONE NIGHT IN WHICH TO PREPARE FOR DEATH
lbi-2803-154328-0002 THE MEAL ENDED
lbi-2803-154328-0003 SLEEP WHICH KEEPS ALL SORROW IN ABEYANCE SOON WEIGHED DOWN THEIR EYELIDS THEY SLEPT IN EACH OTHER'S ARMS OVERCOME BY EXHAUSTION AND PROLONGED WATCHING
lbi-2803-154328-0004 IF IT IS DECREED THAT WE DIE TO MORROW LET US DIE BRAVELY LIKE CHRISTIAN MEN READY TO APPEAR WITHOUT TERROR BEFORE THE SUPREME JUDGE
lbi-2803-154328-0005 GOD WHO READS OUR HEARTS KNOWS THAT WE HAD A NOBLE END IN VIEW
lbi-2803-154328-0006 GLENARVAN'S VOICE FIRM TILL NOW FALTERED
lbi-2803-154328-0007 JOHN YOU HAVE PROMISED MARY WHAT I PROMISED LADY HELENA WHAT IS YOUR PLAN
lbi-2803-154328-0008 I BELIEVE SAID JOHN THAT IN THE SIGHT OF GOD I HAVE A RIGHT TO FULFILL THAT PROMISE
lbi-2803-154328-0009 MY LORD WHICHEVER OF US SURVIVES THE OTHER WILL FULFILL THE WISH OF LADY HELENA AND MARY GRANT
lbi-2803-154328-0010 AT LAST THE MAJOR SAID MY FRIENDS KEEP THAT TO THE LAST MOMENT
lbi-2803-154328-0011 THE JAILER MAY FORGET THAT HE IS ON GUARD THE PRISONER NEVER FORGETS THAT HE IS GUARDED
lbi-2803-154328-0012 ON THAT SIDE DESCENT WAS IMPOSSIBLE AND HAD IT BEEN POSSIBLE THE BOTTOM WAS SHUT IN BY THE ENORMOUS ROCK
lbi-2803-154328-0013 LISTEN SAID HE MOTIONING THEM TO STOOP
lbi-2803-154328-0014 ANIMAL OR MAN ANSWERED THE MAJOR I WILL SOON FIND OUT
lbi-2803-154328-0015 WILSON AND OLBINETT JOINED THEIR COMPANIONS AND ALL UNITED TO DIG THROUGH THE WALL JOHN WITH HIS DAGGER THE OTHERS WITH STONES TAKEN FROM THE GROUND OR WITH THEIR NAILS WHILE MULRADY STRETCHED ALONG THE GROUND WATCHED THE NATIVE GUARD THROUGH A CREVICE OF THE MATTING
lbi-2803-154328-0016 WHAT COULD BE THE OBJECT
lbi-2803-154328-0017 DID THEY KNOW OF THE EXISTENCE OF THE PRISONERS OR WAS IT SOME PRIVATE ENTERPRISE THAT LED TO THE UNDERTAKING
lbi-2803-154328-0018 THEIR FINGERS BLED BUT STILL THEY WORKED ON AFTER HALF AN HOUR THEY HAD GONE THREE FEET DEEP THEY PERCEIVED BY THE INCREASED SHARPNESS OF THE SOUNDS THAT ONLY A THIN LAYER OF EARTH PREVENTED IMMEDIATE COMMUNICATION
lbi-2803-154328-0019 JOHN MANGLES INSERTING THE BLADE OF HIS PONIARD AVOIDED THE KNIFE WHICH NOW PROTRUDED ABOVE THE SOIL BUT SEIZED THE HAND THAT WIELDED IT
lbi-2803-154328-0020 BUT SOFTLY AS THE NAME WAS BREATHED MARY GRANT ALREADY AWAKENED BY THE SOUNDS IN THE HUT SLIPPED OVER TOWARD GLENARVAN AND SEIZING THE HAND ALL STAINED WITH EARTH SHE COVERED IT WITH KISSES
lbi-2803-154328-0021 WATCH THE SAVAGES OUTSIDE SAID ROBERT
lbi-2803-154328-0022 ROUND HIS BODY WAS ROLLED A LONG COIL OF FLAX ROPE
lbi-2803-154328-0023 MY CHILD MY CHILD MURMURED LADY HELENA THE SAVAGES DID NOT KILL YOU
lbi-2803-161169-0000 ONCE THERE WAS A FATHER WHO THOUGHT HE WOULD BUILD FOR HIS CHILDREN A BEAUTIFUL HOME PUTTING INTO IT EVERY THING THEY COULD NEED OR DESIRE THROUGHOUT THEIR LIVES
lbi-2803-161169-0001 THE SWEETEST PERFUMES FLOATED THROUGH THE AIR WHILE THOUSANDS OF BIRDS ANSWERED THE MUSIC OF FOUNTAINS WITH THEIR SONGS
lbi-2803-161169-0002 WHY DID HE GIVE THAT SO ODD A SHAPE OR SO STRANGE A COVERING
lbi-2803-161169-0003 AND SO THROUGH MANY QUESTIONS AND MANY EXPERIMENTS THEY LEARN AT LAST HOW TO USE THE CONTENTS OF THIS ONE STOREHOUSE
lbi-2803-161169-0004 THE ENTRANCE IS LIGHT BECAUSE IT OPENS SO WIDE BUT WE CAN SEE THAT THE FLOOR SLOPES DOWNWARD AND THE WAY LOOKS DARK AND NARROW BEFORE US
lbi-2803-161169-0005 WALK DOWN THE SLOPING FOOT PATH NOW AND BE CAREFUL TO KEEP OUT OF THE WAY OF THE LITTLE CARS THAT ARE COMING AND GOING ON EACH SIDE OF YOU LOADED ON ONE SIDE AND EMPTY ON THE OTHER AND SEEMING TO RUN UP AND DOWN BY THEMSELVES
lbi-2803-161169-0006 LOOK A LITTLE CLOSER WHILE OUR GUIDE LETS THE LIGHT OF HIS LAMP FALL UPON THE BLACK WALL AT YOUR SIDE
lbi-2803-161169-0007 SEE BENEATH YOUR FEET IS THE MARKING OF GREAT TREE TRUNKS LYING ASLANT ACROSS THE FLOOR AND THE FORMS OF GIGANTIC PALM LEAVES STREWED AMONG THEM
lbi-2803-161169-0008 HERE IS SOMETHING DIFFERENT ROUNDED LIKE A NUT SHELL YOU CAN SPLIT OFF ONE SIDE AND BEHOLD THERE IS THE NUT LYING SNUGLY AS DOES ANY CHESTNUT IN ITS BUR
lbi-2803-161169-0009 FERNS AND PALMS MOSSES AND TREES AND ANIMALS ALL PERFECT ALL BEAUTIFUL AND YET ALL HIDDEN AWAY UNDER THIS HILL AND TURNED INTO SHINING BLACK COAL NOW I CAN VERY WELL REMEMBER WHEN I FIRST SAW A COAL FIRE AND HOW ODD IT LOOKED TO SEE WHAT SEEMED TO BE BURNING STONES
lbi-2803-161169-0010 FOR WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL WE ALWAYS HAD LOGS OF WOOD BLAZING IN AN OPEN FIREPLACE AND SO DID MANY OTHER PEOPLE AND COAL WAS JUST COMING INTO USE FOR FUEL
lbi-2803-161169-0011 WHAT SHOULD WE HAVE DONE IF EVERYBODY HAD KEPT ON BURNING WOOD TO THIS DAY
lbi-2803-161169-0012 THESE FORESTS WERE OF TREES DIFFERENT IN SOME WAYS FROM THOSE WE HAVE NOW GREAT FERNS AS TALL AS THIS HOUSE AND MOSSES AS HIGH AS LITTLE TREES AND PALM LEAVES OF ENORMOUS SIZE
lbi-2803-161169-0013 THEN THE HILLS WERE PILED UP ON TOP OF IT ALL BUT HERE AND THERE SOME EDGE OF A COAL BED WAS TILTED UP AND APPEARED ABOVE THE GROUND
lbi-2803-161169-0014 BUT BY AND BY THE WISE MEN THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND SAID TO THEMSELVES WE MUST FIND OUT WHAT USEFUL PURPOSE GOD MADE THE GAS FOR WE KNOW THAT HE DOES NOT MAKE ANY THING FOR HARM ONLY
lbi-2803-161169-0015 IT WAS ONLY A TROUBLE TO THE GAS MAKERS WHO HAD NO USE FOR IT AND EVEN THREW IT AWAY UNTIL SOME ONE MORE THOUGHTFUL THAN THE OTHERS FOUND OUT THAT WATER WOULD NOT PASS THROUGH IT
lbi-2803-161169-0016 DON'T YOU SEE HOW MANY USES WE HAVE FOUND FOR THIS REFUSE COAL TAR
lbi-2803-161169-0017 WHEN YOUR HANDS OR LIPS ARE CRACKED AND ROUGH FROM THE COLD DOES YOUR MOTHER EVER PUT ON GLYCERIN TO HEAL THEM
