lbi-1255-90413-0000 SHE DRAWS CLOSE AND SATISFIES
lbi-1255-90413-0001 HE COULD NOT FORGET MISSUS PINE AVON'S EYES THOUGH HE REMEMBERED NOTHING OF HER OTHER FACIAL DETAILS
lbi-1255-90413-0002 AFTERWARDS THEY KEPT APART AWHILE IN THE DRAWING ROOM FOR FORM'S SAKE BUT EVENTUALLY GRAVITATED TOGETHER AGAIN AND FINISHED THE EVENING IN EACH OTHER'S COMPANY
lbi-1255-90413-0003 BUT THIS WAS NOT ALL
lbi-1255-90413-0004 BUT WAS HE ABLE
lbi-1255-90413-0005 IT WAS UNFAIR TO GO FURTHER WITHOUT TELLING HER EVEN THOUGH HITHERTO SUCH EXPLICITNESS HAD NOT BEEN ABSOLUTELY DEMANDED
lbi-1255-90413-0006 HE DETERMINED TO CALL IMMEDIATELY ON THE NEW INCARNATION
lbi-1255-90413-0007 SHE LIVED NOT FAR FROM THE LONG FASHIONABLE HAMPTONSHIRE SQUARE AND HE WENT THITHER WITH EXPECTATIONS OF HAVING A HIGHLY EMOTIONAL TIME AT LEAST
lbi-1255-90413-0008 BUT SOMEHOW THE VERY BELL PULL SEEMED COLD ALTHOUGH SHE HAD SO EARNESTLY ASKED HIM TO COME
lbi-1255-90413-0009 RAISING HER EYES IN A SLIGHTLY INQUIRING MANNER FROM THE BOOK SHE WAS READING SHE LEANT BACK IN THE CHAIR AS IF SOAKING HERSELF IN LUXURIOUS SENSATIONS WHICH HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM AND REPLIED TO HIS GREETING WITH A FEW COMMONPLACE WORDS
lbi-1255-90413-0010 JUST AS THEY TURN MADEIRA INTO PORT IN THE SPACE OF A SINGLE NIGHT SO THIS OLD AIR HAS BEEN TAKEN AND DOCTORED AND TWISTED ABOUT AND BROUGHT OUT AS A NEW POPULAR DITTY INDEED
lbi-1255-90413-0011 SHE THAWED A LITTLE AND THEN THEY WENT ON TO TALK ABOUT HER HOUSE WHICH HAD BEEN NEWLY PAINTED AND DECORATED WITH GREENISH BLUE SATIN UP TO THE HEIGHT OF A PERSON'S HEAD AN ARRANGEMENT THAT SOMEWHAT IMPROVED HER SLIGHTLY FADED THOUGH STILL PRETTY FACE AND WAS HELPED BY THE AWNINGS OVER THE WINDOWS
lbi-1255-90413-0012 YES I HAVE HAD MY HOUSE SOME YEARS SHE OBSERVED COMPLACENTLY AND I LIKE IT BETTER EVERY YEAR
lbi-1255-90413-0013 DON'T YOU FEEL LONELY IN IT SOMETIMES O NEVER
lbi-1255-90413-0014 WHAT AN UNCIVIL THING TO SAY SHE MURMURED IN SURPRISE
lbi-1255-90413-0015 IT IS RATHER UNCIVIL
lbi-1255-90413-0016 AS A PUNISHMENT SHE DID NOT RING THE BELL BUT LEFT HIM TO FIND HIS WAY OUT AS HE COULD
lbi-1255-90413-0017 I SAW HIM AT LADY CHANNELCLIFFE'S THE OTHER NIGHT
lbi-1255-90413-0018 JOCELYN PIERSTON
lbi-1255-90413-0019 O DIDN'T HE MARRY HER
lbi-1255-90413-0020 SAID MISSUS PINE AVON WITH A START
lbi-1255-90413-0021 BUT JOCELYN WAS RECEDING FROM THE PRETTY WIDOW'S HOUSE WITH LONG STRIDES
lbi-1255-90413-0022 LADY IRIS HAD LEFT THE DRAWING ROOM FOR A MOMENT TO SEE THAT ALL WAS RIGHT IN THE DINING ROOM AND WHEN HE WAS SHOWN IN THERE STOOD ALONE IN THE LAMPLIGHT NICHOLA PINE AVON
lbi-1255-90413-0023 SHE HAD BEEN THE FIRST ARRIVAL
lbi-1255-90413-0024 AS THE OTHER GUESTS DROPPED IN THE PAIR RETREATED INTO A SHADY CORNER AND SHE TALKED BESIDE HIM TILL ALL MOVED OFF FOR THE EATING AND DRINKING
lbi-1255-90413-0025 HE HAD NOT BEEN APPOINTED TO TAKE HER ACROSS TO THE DINING ROOM BUT AT THE TABLE FOUND HER EXACTLY OPPOSITE
lbi-1255-90413-0026 THE SPRING IN THE PRESENT CASE WAS THE ARTISTIC COMMENDATION SHE DESERVED AND CRAVED
lbi-1255-90413-0027 THE LADY ON JOCELYN'S LEFT WIFE OF A LORD JUSTICE OF APPEAL WAS IN LIKE MANNER TALKING TO HER COMPANION ON THE OUTER SIDE SO THAT FOR THE TIME HE WAS LEFT TO HIMSELF
lbi-1255-90413-0028 IT CAME FROM THE WIFE OF ONE OF HIS FATHER'S FORMER WORKMEN AND WAS CONCERNING HER SON WHOM SHE BEGGED JOCELYN TO RECOMMEND AS CANDIDATE FOR SOME POST IN TOWN THAT SHE WISHED HIM TO FILL
lbi-1585-131718-0000 WHAT IS NECESSARY TO THE COMPLETENESS OF THE STORY AT THIS STAGE IS NOT TO RECAPITULATE BUT TO TAKE UP SOME OF THE LOOSE ENDS OF THREADS WOVEN IN AND FOLLOW THEM THROUGH UNTIL THE CLEAR AND COMPREHENSIVE PICTURE OF EVENTS CAN BE SEEN
lbi-1585-131718-0001 THE WAY OF THE INVENTOR IS HARD
lbi-1585-131718-0002 HE CAN SOMETIMES RAISE CAPITAL TO HELP HIM IN WORKING OUT HIS CRUDE CONCEPTIONS BUT EVEN THEN IT IS FREQUENTLY DONE AT A DISTRESSFUL COST OF PERSONAL SURRENDER
lbi-1585-131718-0003 WHEN THE RESULT IS ACHIEVED THE INVENTION MAKES ITS APPEAL ON THE SCORE OF ECONOMY OF MATERIAL OR OF EFFORT AND THEN LABOR OFTEN AWAITS WITH CRUSHING AND TYRANNICAL SPIRIT TO SMASH THE APPARATUS OR FORBID ITS VERY USE
lbi-1585-131718-0004 POSSIBLY OUR NATIONAL OPTIMISM AS REVEALED IN INVENTION THE SEEKING A HIGHER GOOD NEEDS SOME CHECK
lbi-1585-131718-0005 POSSIBLY THE LEADERS WOULD TRAVEL TOO FAST AND TOO FAR ON THE ROAD TO PERFECTION IF CONSERVATISM DID NOT ALSO PLAY ITS SALUTARY PART IN INSISTING THAT THE PROCESSION MOVE FORWARD AS A WHOLE
lbi-1585-131718-0006 ON THE CONTRARY THE CONDITIONS FOR ITS ACCEPTANCE HAD BEEN RIPENING FAST
lbi-1585-131718-0007 YET THE VERY VOGUE OF THE ELECTRIC ARC LIGHT MADE HARDER THE ARRIVAL OF THE INCANDESCENT
lbi-1585-131718-0008 A NUMBER OF PARENT ARC LIGHTING COMPANIES WERE IN EXISTENCE AND A GREAT MANY LOCAL COMPANIES HAD BEEN CALLED INTO BEING UNDER FRANCHISES FOR COMMERCIAL BUSINESS AND TO EXECUTE REGULAR CITY CONTRACTS FOR STREET LIGHTING
lbi-1585-131718-0009 THUS IN A CURIOUS MANNER THE MODERN ART OF ELECTRIC LIGHTING WAS IN A VERY TRUE SENSE DIVIDED AGAINST ITSELF WITH INTENSE RIVALRIES AND JEALOUSIES WHICH WERE NONE THE LESS REAL BECAUSE THEY WERE BUT TEMPORARY AND OCCURRED IN A FIELD WHERE ULTIMATE UNION OF FORCES WAS INEVITABLE
lbi-1585-131718-0010 HENCE TWENTY YEARS AFTER THE FIRST EDISON STATIONS WERE ESTABLISHED THE METHODS THEY INVOLVED COULD BE FAIRLY CREDITED WITH NO LESS THAN SIXTY SEVEN PER CENT
lbi-1585-131718-0011 IT WILL BE READILY UNDERSTOOD THAT UNDER THESE CONDITIONS THE MODERN LIGHTING COMPANY SUPPLIES TO ITS CUSTOMERS BOTH INCANDESCENT AND ARC LIGHTING FREQUENTLY FROM THE SAME DYNAMO ELECTRIC MACHINERY AS A SOURCE OF CURRENT AND THAT THE OLD FEUD AS BETWEEN THE RIVAL SYSTEMS HAS DIED OUT
lbi-1585-131718-0012 IN FACT FOR SOME YEARS PAST THE PRESIDENTS OF THE NATIONAL ELECTRIC LIGHT ASSOCIATION HAVE BEEN CHOSEN ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY FROM AMONG THE MANAGERS OF THE GREAT EDISON LIGHTING COMPANIES IN THE LEADING CITIES
lbi-1585-131718-0013 THE OTHER STRONG OPPOSITION TO THE INCANDESCENT LIGHT CAME FROM THE GAS INDUSTRY
lbi-1585-131718-0014 THERE ALSO THE MOST BITTER FEELING WAS SHOWN
lbi-1585-131718-0015 THE GAS MANAGER DID NOT LIKE THE ARC LIGHT BUT IT INTERFERED ONLY WITH HIS STREET SERVICE WHICH WAS NOT HIS LARGEST SOURCE OF INCOME BY ANY MEANS
lbi-1585-131718-0016 HERE AGAIN WAS GIVEN A MOST CONVINCING DEMONSTRATION OF THE TRUTH THAT SUCH AN ADDITION TO THE RESOURCES OF MANKIND ALWAYS CARRIES WITH IT UNSUSPECTED BENEFITS EVEN FOR ITS ENEMIES
lbi-1585-131718-0017 THIS WAS NOT LONG NOR UNIVERSALLY THE SPIRIT SHOWN AND TO DAY IN HUNDREDS OF CITIES THE ELECTRIC AND GAS PROPERTIES ARE UNITED UNDER THE ONE MANAGEMENT WHICH DOES NOT FIND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO PUSH IN A FRIENDLY AND PROGRESSIVE WAY THE USE OF BOTH ILLUMINANTS
lbi-1585-131718-0018 THE MOST CONSPICUOUS EXAMPLE OF THIS IDENTITY OF INTEREST IS GIVEN IN NEW YORK ITSELF
lbi-1585-131718-0019 SO MUCH FOR THE EARLY OPPOSITION OF WHICH THERE WAS PLENTY
lbi-1585-131718-0020 BUT IT MAY BE QUESTIONED WHETHER INERTIA IS NOT EQUALLY TO BE DREADED WITH ACTIVE ILL WILL
lbi-1585-131718-0021 OF COURSE A GREAT MANY ACCOUNTS WERE WRITTEN AND READ BUT WHILE GENUINE INTEREST WAS AROUSED IT WAS NECESSARILY APATHETIC
lbi-1585-131718-0022 WE GOT IT AT A GREAT BARGAIN AND ONLY PAID A SMALL SUM DOWN AND THE BALANCE ON MORTGAGE
lbi-1585-131718-0023 WE SOLD THEM FOR FORTY CENTS BUT THERE WERE ONLY ABOUT TWENTY OR THIRTY THOUSAND OF THEM
lbi-1585-131718-0024 THE FOURTH YEAR I GOT IT DOWN TO THIRTY SEVEN CENTS AND I MADE ALL THE MONEY UP IN ONE YEAR THAT I HAD LOST PREVIOUSLY
lbi-1585-131718-0025 ONE OF THE INCIDENTS WHICH CAUSED A VERY GREAT CHEAPENING WAS THAT WHEN WE STARTED ONE OF THE IMPORTANT PROCESSES HAD TO BE DONE BY EXPERTS
lbi-1585-131718-0026 AFTER FEELING AROUND FOR SOME DAYS I GOT A CLEW HOW TO DO IT
lbi-1585-131718-0027 I THEN MADE ANOTHER MACHINE WHICH DID THE WORK NICELY
lbi-1585-131718-0028 INCIDENTALLY IT MAY BE NOTED AS ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE PROBLEMS BROUGHT TO EDISON THAT WHILE HE HAD THE FACTORY AT HARRISON AN IMPORTER IN THE CHINESE TRADE WENT TO HIM AND WANTED A DYNAMO TO BE RUN BY HAND POWER
lbi-1585-131718-0029 FOR MAKING THE DYNAMOS EDISON SECURED AS NOTED IN THE PRECEDING CHAPTER THE ROACH IRON WORKS ON GOERCK STREET NEW YORK AND THIS WAS ALSO EQUIPPED
lbi-1585-131718-0030 TO SIGMUND BERGMANN WHO HAD WORKED PREVIOUSLY WITH EDISON ON TELEPHONE APPARATUS AND PHONOGRAPHS AND WAS ALREADY MAKING EDISON SPECIALTIES IN A SMALL WAY IN A LOFT ON WOOSTER STREET NEW YORK WAS ASSIGNED THE TASK OF CONSTRUCTING SOCKETS FIXTURES METERS SAFETY FUSES AND NUMEROUS OTHER DETAILS
lbi-1585-131718-0031 IN THE EARLY PART OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTY ONE THE EDISON ELECTRIC LIGHT COMPANY LEASED THE OLD BISHOP MANSION AT SIXTY FIVE FIFTH AVENUE CLOSE TO FOURTEENTH STREET FOR ITS HEADQUARTERS AND SHOW ROOMS
lbi-1585-131718-0032 THIS WAS ONE OF THE FINEST HOMES IN THE CITY OF THAT PERIOD AND ITS ACQUISITION WAS A PREMONITORY SIGN OF THE SURRENDER OF THE FAMOUS RESIDENTIAL AVENUE TO COMMERCE
lbi-1585-131718-0033 THE EXPERIENCE WITH THE LITTLE GAS ENGINE WAS RATHER STARTLING
lbi-1585-131718-0034 ONE DAY IT WAS NOT GOING VERY WELL AND I WENT DOWN TO THE MAN IN CHARGE AND GOT EXPLORING AROUND
lbi-1585-131718-0035 FOR THE NEXT FOUR OR FIVE YEARS SIXTY FIVE WAS A VERITABLE BEEHIVE DAY AND NIGHT
lbi-1585-131718-0036 THE ROUTINE WAS VERY MUCH THE SAME AS THAT AT THE LABORATORY IN ITS UTTER NEGLECT OF THE CLOCK
lbi-1585-131718-0037 I WAS TELLING A GENTLEMAN ONE DAY THAT I COULD NOT KEEP A CIGAR EVEN IF I LOCKED THEM UP IN MY DESK THEY WOULD BREAK IT OPEN
lbi-1585-131718-0038 HE SUGGESTED TO ME THAT HE HAD A FRIEND OVER ON EIGHTH AVENUE WHO MADE A SUPERIOR GRADE OF CIGARS AND WHO WOULD SHOW THEM A TRICK
lbi-1585-131718-0039 HE SAID HE WOULD HAVE SOME OF THEM MADE UP WITH HAIR AND OLD PAPER AND I COULD PUT THEM IN WITHOUT A WORD AND SEE THE RESULT
lbi-1585-131718-0040 I THOUGHT NO MORE ABOUT THE MATTER
lbi-1585-131718-0041 I DIDN'T REMEMBER ANYTHING ABOUT IT
lbi-1585-131718-0042 I WAS TOO BUSY ON OTHER THINGS TO NOTICE
lbi-1585-131718-0043 SPEAKING OF THOSE DAYS OR NIGHTS EDISON SAYS YEARS AGO ONE OF THE GREAT VIOLINISTS WAS REMENYI
lbi-1585-131718-0044 HE WOULD TALK WITH ME BUT I NEVER ASKED HIM TO BRING HIS VIOLIN
lbi-1585-131718-0045 ONE NIGHT HE CAME WITH HIS VIOLIN ABOUT TWELVE O'CLOCK
lbi-1585-131718-0046 AFTER THAT EVERY TIME HE CAME TO NEW YORK HE USED TO CALL AT SIXTY FIVE LATE AT NIGHT WITH HIS VIOLIN
lbi-1585-131718-0047 ANOTHER VISITOR WHO USED TO GIVE US A GOOD DEAL OF AMUSEMENT AND PLEASURE WAS CAPTAIN SHAW THE HEAD OF THE LONDON FIRE BRIGADE
lbi-1585-131718-0048 HE WOULD GO OUT AMONG THE FIRE LADDIES AND HAVE A GREAT TIME
lbi-1585-131718-0049 SPEAKING OF TELLING STORIES I ONCE GOT TELLING A MAN STORIES AT THE HARRISON LAMP FACTORY IN THE YARD AS HE WAS LEAVING
lbi-1585-131718-0050 IT WAS WINTER AND HE WAS ALL IN FURS
lbi-1585-131718-0051 I HAD NOTHING ON TO PROTECT ME AGAINST THE COLD
lbi-1585-131718-0052 THEN I GOT PLEURISY AND HAD TO BE SHIPPED TO FLORIDA FOR CURE
lbi-1585-131718-0053 IT HAD MERELY ENJOYED THE DELIGHTS OF ANXIOUS ANTICIPATION AND THE PERILOUS PLEASURE OF BACKING EDISON'S EXPERIMENTS
lbi-1585-131718-0054 NOW ACTIVE EXPLOITATION WAS REQUIRED
