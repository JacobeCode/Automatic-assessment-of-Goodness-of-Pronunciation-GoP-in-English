lbi-1272-128104-0000 MISTER QUILTER IS THE APOSTLE OF THE MIDDLE CLASSES AND WE ARE GLAD TO WELCOME HIS GOSPEL
lbi-1272-128104-0001 NOR IS MISTER QUILTER'S MANNER LESS INTERESTING THAN HIS MATTER
lbi-1272-128104-0002 HE TELLS US THAT AT THIS FESTIVE SEASON OF THE YEAR WITH CHRISTMAS AND ROAST BEEF LOOMING BEFORE US SIMILES DRAWN FROM EATING AND ITS RESULTS OCCUR MOST READILY TO THE MIND
lbi-1272-128104-0003 HE HAS GRAVE DOUBTS WHETHER SIR FREDERICK LEIGHTON'S WORK IS REALLY GREEK AFTER ALL AND CAN DISCOVER IN IT BUT LITTLE OF ROCKY ITHACA
lbi-1272-128104-0004 LINNELL'S PICTURES ARE A SORT OF UP GUARDS AND AT EM PAINTINGS AND MASON'S EXQUISITE IDYLLS ARE AS NATIONAL AS A JINGO POEM MISTER BIRKET FOSTER'S LANDSCAPES SMILE AT ONE MUCH IN THE SAME WAY THAT MISTER CARKER USED TO FLASH HIS TEETH AND MISTER JOHN COLLIER GIVES HIS SITTER A CHEERFUL SLAP ON THE BACK BEFORE HE SAYS LIKE A SHAMPOOER IN A TURKISH BATH NEXT MAN
lbi-1272-128104-0005 IT IS OBVIOUSLY UNNECESSARY FOR US TO POINT OUT HOW LUMINOUS THESE CRITICISMS ARE HOW DELICATE IN EXPRESSION
lbi-1272-128104-0006 ON THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF ART MISTER QUILTER WRITES WITH EQUAL LUCIDITY
lbi-1272-128104-0007 PAINTING HE TELLS US IS OF A DIFFERENT QUALITY TO MATHEMATICS AND FINISH IN ART IS ADDING MORE FACT
lbi-1272-128104-0008 AS FOR ETCHINGS THEY ARE OF TWO KINDS BRITISH AND FOREIGN
lbi-1272-128104-0009 HE LAMENTS MOST BITTERLY THE DIVORCE THAT HAS BEEN MADE BETWEEN DECORATIVE ART AND WHAT WE USUALLY CALL PICTURES MAKES THE CUSTOMARY APPEAL TO THE LAST JUDGMENT AND REMINDS US THAT IN THE GREAT DAYS OF ART MICHAEL ANGELO WAS THE FURNISHING UPHOLSTERER
lbi-1272-128104-0010 NEAR THE FIRE AND THE ORNAMENTS FRED BROUGHT HOME FROM INDIA ON THE MANTEL BOARD
lbi-1272-128104-0011 IN FACT HE IS QUITE SEVERE ON MISTER RUSKIN FOR NOT RECOGNISING THAT A PICTURE SHOULD DENOTE THE FRAILTY OF MAN AND REMARKS WITH PLEASING COURTESY AND FELICITOUS GRACE THAT MANY PHASES OF FEELING
lbi-1272-128104-0012 ONLY UNFORTUNATELY HIS OWN WORK NEVER DOES GET GOOD
lbi-1272-128104-0013 MISTER QUILTER HAS MISSED HIS CHANCE FOR HE HAS FAILED EVEN TO MAKE HIMSELF THE TUPPER OF PAINTING
lbi-1272-128104-0014 BY HARRY QUILTER M A
lbi-1272-135031-0000 BECAUSE YOU WERE SLEEPING INSTEAD OF CONQUERING THE LOVELY ROSE PRINCESS HAS BECOME A FIDDLE WITHOUT A BOW WHILE POOR SHAGGY SITS THERE A COOING DOVE
lbi-1272-135031-0001 HE HAS GONE AND GONE FOR GOOD ANSWERED POLYCHROME WHO HAD MANAGED TO SQUEEZE INTO THE ROOM BESIDE THE DRAGON AND HAD WITNESSED THE OCCURRENCES WITH MUCH INTEREST
lbi-1272-135031-0002 I HAVE REMAINED A PRISONER ONLY BECAUSE I WISHED TO BE ONE AND WITH THIS HE STEPPED FORWARD AND BURST THE STOUT CHAINS AS EASILY AS IF THEY HAD BEEN THREADS
lbi-1272-135031-0003 THE LITTLE GIRL HAD BEEN ASLEEP BUT SHE HEARD THE RAPS AND OPENED THE DOOR
lbi-1272-135031-0004 THE KING HAS FLED IN DISGRACE AND YOUR FRIENDS ARE ASKING FOR YOU
lbi-1272-135031-0005 I BEGGED RUGGEDO LONG AGO TO SEND HIM AWAY BUT HE WOULD NOT DO SO
lbi-1272-135031-0006 I ALSO OFFERED TO HELP YOUR BROTHER TO ESCAPE BUT HE WOULD NOT GO
lbi-1272-135031-0007 HE EATS AND SLEEPS VERY STEADILY REPLIED THE NEW KING
lbi-1272-135031-0008 I HOPE HE DOESN'T WORK TOO HARD SAID SHAGGY
lbi-1272-135031-0009 HE DOESN'T WORK AT ALL
lbi-1272-135031-0010 IN FACT THERE IS NOTHING HE CAN DO IN THESE DOMINIONS AS WELL AS OUR NOMES WHOSE NUMBERS ARE SO GREAT THAT IT WORRIES US TO KEEP THEM ALL BUSY
lbi-1272-135031-0011 NOT EXACTLY RETURNED KALIKO
lbi-1272-135031-0012 WHERE IS MY BROTHER NOW
lbi-1272-135031-0013 INQUIRED SHAGGY IN THE METAL FOREST
lbi-1272-135031-0014 WHERE IS THAT
lbi-1272-135031-0015 THE METAL FOREST IS IN THE GREAT DOMED CAVERN THE LARGEST IN ALL OUR DOMINIONS REPLIED KALIKO
lbi-1272-135031-0016 KALIKO HESITATED
lbi-1272-135031-0017 HOWEVER IF WE LOOK SHARP WE MAY BE ABLE TO DISCOVER ONE OF THESE SECRET WAYS
lbi-1272-135031-0018 OH NO I'M QUITE SURE HE DIDN'T
lbi-1272-135031-0019 THAT'S FUNNY REMARKED BETSY THOUGHTFULLY
lbi-1272-135031-0020 I DON'T BELIEVE ANN KNEW ANY MAGIC OR SHE'D HAVE WORKED IT BEFORE
lbi-1272-135031-0021 I DO NOT KNOW CONFESSED SHAGGY
lbi-1272-135031-0022 TRUE AGREED KALIKO
lbi-1272-135031-0023 KALIKO WENT TO THE BIG GONG AND POUNDED ON IT JUST AS RUGGEDO USED TO DO BUT NO ONE ANSWERED THE SUMMONS
lbi-1272-135031-0024 HAVING RETURNED TO THE ROYAL CAVERN KALIKO FIRST POUNDED THE GONG AND THEN SAT IN THE THRONE WEARING RUGGEDO'S DISCARDED RUBY CROWN AND HOLDING IN HIS HAND THE SCEPTRE WHICH RUGGEDO HAD SO OFTEN THROWN AT HIS HEAD
lbi-1272-141231-0000 A MAN SAID TO THE UNIVERSE SIR I EXIST
lbi-1272-141231-0001 SWEAT COVERED BRION'S BODY TRICKLING INTO THE TIGHT LOINCLOTH THAT WAS THE ONLY GARMENT HE WORE
lbi-1272-141231-0002 THE CUT ON HIS CHEST STILL DRIPPING BLOOD THE ACHE OF HIS OVERSTRAINED EYES EVEN THE SOARING ARENA AROUND HIM WITH THE THOUSANDS OF SPECTATORS WERE TRIVIALITIES NOT WORTH THINKING ABOUT
lbi-1272-141231-0003 HIS INSTANT OF PANIC WAS FOLLOWED BY A SMALL SHARP BLOW HIGH ON HIS CHEST
lbi-1272-141231-0004 ONE MINUTE A VOICE SAID AND THE TIME BUZZER SOUNDED
lbi-1272-141231-0005 A MINUTE IS NOT A VERY LARGE MEASURE OF TIME AND HIS BODY NEEDED EVERY FRACTION OF IT
lbi-1272-141231-0006 THE BUZZER'S WHIRR TRIGGERED HIS MUSCLES INTO COMPLETE RELAXATION
lbi-1272-141231-0007 ONLY HIS HEART AND LUNGS WORKED ON AT A STRONG MEASURED RATE
lbi-1272-141231-0008 HE WAS IN REVERIE SLIDING ALONG THE BORDERS OF CONSCIOUSNESS
lbi-1272-141231-0009 THE CONTESTANTS IN THE TWENTIES NEEDED UNDISTURBED REST THEREFORE NIGHTS IN THE DORMITORIES WERE AS QUIET AS DEATH
lbi-1272-141231-0010 PARTICULARLY SO ON THIS LAST NIGHT WHEN ONLY TWO OF THE LITTLE CUBICLES WERE OCCUPIED THE THOUSANDS OF OTHERS STANDING WITH DARK EMPTY DOORS
lbi-1272-141231-0011 THE OTHER VOICE SNAPPED WITH A HARSH URGENCY CLEARLY USED TO COMMAND
lbi-1272-141231-0012 I'M HERE BECAUSE THE MATTER IS OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE AND BRANDD IS THE ONE I MUST SEE NOW STAND ASIDE
lbi-1272-141231-0013 THE TWENTIES
lbi-1272-141231-0014 HE MUST HAVE DRAWN HIS GUN BECAUSE THE INTRUDER SAID QUICKLY PUT THAT AWAY YOU'RE BEING A FOOL OUT
lbi-1272-141231-0015 THERE WAS SILENCE THEN AND STILL WONDERING BRION WAS ONCE MORE ASLEEP
lbi-1272-141231-0016 TEN SECONDS
lbi-1272-141231-0017 HE ASKED THE HANDLER WHO WAS KNEADING HIS ACHING MUSCLES
lbi-1272-141231-0018 A RED HAIRED MOUNTAIN OF A MAN WITH AN APPARENTLY INEXHAUSTIBLE STORE OF ENERGY
lbi-1272-141231-0019 THERE COULD BE LITTLE ART IN THIS LAST AND FINAL ROUND OF FENCING
lbi-1272-141231-0020 JUST THRUST AND PARRY AND VICTORY TO THE STRONGER
lbi-1272-141231-0021 EVERY MAN WHO ENTERED THE TWENTIES HAD HIS OWN TRAINING TRICKS
lbi-1272-141231-0022 THERE APPEARED TO BE AN IMMEDIATE ASSOCIATION WITH THE DEATH TRAUMA AS IF THE TWO WERE INEXTRICABLY LINKED INTO ONE
lbi-1272-141231-0023 THE STRENGTH THAT ENABLES SOMEONE IN A TRANCE TO HOLD HIS BODY STIFF AND UNSUPPORTED EXCEPT AT TWO POINTS THE HEAD AND HEELS
lbi-1272-141231-0024 THIS IS PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE WHEN CONSCIOUS
lbi-1272-141231-0025 OTHERS HAD DIED BEFORE DURING THE TWENTIES AND DEATH DURING THE LAST ROUND WAS IN SOME WAYS EASIER THAN DEFEAT
lbi-1272-141231-0026 BREATHING DEEPLY BRION SOFTLY SPOKE THE AUTO HYPNOTIC PHRASES THAT TRIGGERED THE PROCESS
lbi-1272-141231-0027 WHEN THE BUZZER SOUNDED HE PULLED HIS FOIL FROM HIS SECOND'S STARTLED GRASP AND RAN FORWARD
lbi-1272-141231-0028 IROLG LOOKED AMAZED AT THE SUDDEN FURY OF THE ATTACK THEN SMILED
lbi-1272-141231-0029 HE THOUGHT IT WAS A LAST BURST OF ENERGY HE KNEW HOW CLOSE THEY BOTH WERE TO EXHAUSTION
lbi-1272-141231-0030 BRION SAW SOMETHING CLOSE TO PANIC ON HIS OPPONENT'S FACE WHEN THE MAN FINALLY RECOGNIZED HIS ERROR
lbi-1272-141231-0031 A WAVE OF DESPAIR ROLLED OUT FROM IROLG BRION SENSED IT AND KNEW THE FIFTH POINT WAS HIS
lbi-1272-141231-0032 THEN THE POWERFUL TWIST THAT THRUST IT ASIDE IN AND UNDER THE GUARD
lbi-1462-170138-0000 HE HAD WRITTEN A NUMBER OF BOOKS HIMSELF AMONG THEM A HISTORY OF DANCING A HISTORY OF COSTUME A KEY TO SHAKESPEARE'S SONNETS A STUDY OF THE POETRY OF ERNEST DOWSON ET CETERA
lbi-1462-170138-0001 HUGH'S WRITTEN A DELIGHTFUL PART FOR HER AND SHE'S QUITE INEXPRESSIBLE
lbi-1462-170138-0002 I HAPPEN TO HAVE MAC CONNELL'S BOX FOR TONIGHT OR THERE'D BE NO CHANCE OF OUR GETTING PLACES
lbi-1462-170138-0003 ALEXANDER EXCLAIMED MILDLY
lbi-1462-170138-0004 MYSELF I ALWAYS KNEW SHE HAD IT IN HER
lbi-1462-170138-0005 DO YOU KNOW ALEXANDER MAINHALL LOOKED WITH PERPLEXITY UP INTO THE TOP OF THE HANSOM AND RUBBED HIS PINK CHEEK WITH HIS GLOVED FINGER DO YOU KNOW I SOMETIMES THINK OF TAKING TO CRITICISM SERIOUSLY MYSELF
lbi-1462-170138-0006 WHEN THEY ENTERED THE STAGE BOX ON THE LEFT THE FIRST ACT WAS WELL UNDER WAY THE SCENE BEING THE INTERIOR OF A CABIN IN THE SOUTH OF IRELAND
lbi-1462-170138-0007 AS THEY SAT DOWN A BURST OF APPLAUSE DREW ALEXANDER'S ATTENTION TO THE STAGE
lbi-1462-170138-0008 OF COURSE HILDA IS IRISH THE BURGOYNES HAVE BEEN STAGE PEOPLE FOR GENERATIONS AND SHE HAS THE IRISH VOICE
lbi-1462-170138-0009 IT'S DELIGHTFUL TO HEAR IT IN A LONDON THEATRE
lbi-1462-170138-0010 WHEN SHE BEGAN TO DANCE BY WAY OF SHOWING THE GOSSOONS WHAT SHE HAD SEEN IN THE FAIRY RINGS AT NIGHT THE HOUSE BROKE INTO A PROLONGED UPROAR
lbi-1462-170138-0011 AFTER HER DANCE SHE WITHDREW FROM THE DIALOGUE AND RETREATED TO THE DITCH WALL BACK OF PHILLY'S BURROW WHERE SHE SAT SINGING THE RISING OF THE MOON AND MAKING A WREATH OF PRIMROSES FOR HER DONKEY
lbi-1462-170138-0012 MAC CONNELL LET ME INTRODUCE MISTER BARTLEY ALEXANDER
lbi-1462-170138-0013 THE PLAYWRIGHT GAVE MAINHALL A CURIOUS LOOK OUT OF HIS DEEP SET FADED EYES AND MADE A WRY FACE
lbi-1462-170138-0014 HE NODDED CURTLY AND MADE FOR THE DOOR DODGING ACQUAINTANCES AS HE WENT
lbi-1462-170138-0015 I DARE SAY IT'S QUITE TRUE THAT THERE'S NEVER BEEN ANY ONE ELSE
lbi-1462-170138-0016 HE'S ANOTHER WHO'S AWFULLY KEEN ABOUT HER LET ME INTRODUCE YOU
lbi-1462-170138-0017 SIR HARRY TOWNE BOWED AND SAID THAT HE HAD MET MISTER ALEXANDER AND HIS WIFE IN TOKYO
lbi-1462-170138-0018 I SAY SIR HARRY THE LITTLE GIRL'S GOING FAMOUSLY TO NIGHT ISN'T SHE
lbi-1462-170138-0019 THE FACT IS SHE'S FEELING RATHER SEEDY POOR CHILD
lbi-1462-170138-0020 A LITTLE ATTACK OF NERVES POSSIBLY
lbi-1462-170138-0021 HE BOWED AS THE WARNING BELL RANG AND MAINHALL WHISPERED YOU KNOW LORD WESTMERE OF COURSE THE STOOPED MAN WITH THE LONG GRAY MUSTACHE TALKING TO LADY DOWLE
lbi-1462-170138-0022 IN A MOMENT PEGGY WAS ON THE STAGE AGAIN AND ALEXANDER APPLAUDED VIGOROUSLY WITH THE REST
lbi-1462-170138-0023 IN THE HALF LIGHT HE LOOKED ABOUT AT THE STALLS AND BOXES AND SMILED A LITTLE CONSCIOUSLY RECALLING WITH AMUSEMENT SIR HARRY'S JUDICIAL FROWN
lbi-1462-170138-0024 HE LEANED FORWARD AND BEAMED FELICITATIONS AS WARMLY AS MAINHALL HIMSELF WHEN AT THE END OF THE PLAY SHE CAME AGAIN AND AGAIN BEFORE THE CURTAIN PANTING A LITTLE AND FLUSHED HER EYES DANCING AND HER EAGER NERVOUS LITTLE MOUTH TREMULOUS WITH EXCITEMENT
lbi-1462-170138-0025 ALL THE SAME HE LIFTED HIS GLASS HERE'S TO YOU LITTLE HILDA
lbi-1462-170138-0026 I'M GLAD SHE'S HELD HER OWN SINCE
lbi-1462-170138-0027 IT WAS YOUTH AND POVERTY AND PROXIMITY AND EVERYTHING WAS YOUNG AND KINDLY
lbi-1462-170142-0000 THE LAST TWO DAYS OF THE VOYAGE BARTLEY FOUND ALMOST INTOLERABLE
lbi-1462-170142-0001 EMERGING AT EUSTON AT HALF PAST THREE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON ALEXANDER HAD HIS LUGGAGE SENT TO THE SAVOY AND DROVE AT ONCE TO BEDFORD SQUARE
lbi-1462-170142-0002 SHE BLUSHED AND SMILED AND FUMBLED HIS CARD IN HER CONFUSION BEFORE SHE RAN UPSTAIRS
lbi-1462-170142-0003 THE ROOM WAS EMPTY WHEN HE ENTERED
lbi-1462-170142-0004 A COAL FIRE WAS CRACKLING IN THE GRATE AND THE LAMPS WERE LIT FOR IT WAS ALREADY BEGINNING TO GROW DARK OUTSIDE
lbi-1462-170142-0005 SHE CALLED HIS NAME ON THE THRESHOLD BUT IN HER SWIFT FLIGHT ACROSS THE ROOM SHE FELT A CHANGE IN HIM AND CAUGHT HERSELF UP SO DEFTLY THAT HE COULD NOT TELL JUST WHEN SHE DID IT
lbi-1462-170142-0006 SHE MERELY BRUSHED HIS CHEEK WITH HER LIPS AND PUT A HAND LIGHTLY AND JOYOUSLY ON EITHER SHOULDER
lbi-1462-170142-0007 I NEVER DREAMED IT WOULD BE YOU BARTLEY
lbi-1462-170142-0008 WHEN DID YOU COME BARTLEY AND HOW DID IT HAPPEN YOU HAVEN'T SPOKEN A WORD
lbi-1462-170142-0009 SHE LOOKED AT HIS HEAVY SHOULDERS AND BIG DETERMINED HEAD THRUST FORWARD LIKE A CATAPULT IN LEASH
lbi-1462-170142-0010 I'LL DO ANYTHING YOU WISH ME TO BARTLEY SHE SAID TREMULOUSLY
lbi-1462-170142-0011 HE PULLED UP A WINDOW AS IF THE AIR WERE HEAVY
lbi-1462-170142-0012 HILDA WATCHED HIM FROM HER CORNER TREMBLING AND SCARCELY BREATHING DARK SHADOWS GROWING ABOUT HER EYES
lbi-1462-170142-0013 IT IT HASN'T ALWAYS MADE YOU MISERABLE HAS IT
lbi-1462-170142-0014 ALWAYS BUT IT'S WORSE NOW
lbi-1462-170142-0015 IT'S UNBEARABLE IT TORTURES ME EVERY MINUTE
lbi-1462-170142-0016 I AM NOT A MAN WHO CAN LIVE TWO LIVES HE WENT ON FEVERISHLY EACH LIFE SPOILS THE OTHER
lbi-1462-170142-0017 I GET NOTHING BUT MISERY OUT OF EITHER
lbi-1462-170142-0018 THERE IS THIS DECEPTION BETWEEN ME AND EVERYTHING
lbi-1462-170142-0019 AT THAT WORD DECEPTION SPOKEN WITH SUCH SELF CONTEMPT THE COLOR FLASHED BACK INTO HILDA'S FACE AS SUDDENLY AS IF SHE HAD BEEN STRUCK BY A WHIPLASH
lbi-1462-170142-0020 SHE BIT HER LIP AND LOOKED DOWN AT HER HANDS WHICH WERE CLASPED TIGHTLY IN FRONT OF HER
lbi-1462-170142-0021 COULD YOU COULD YOU SIT DOWN AND TALK ABOUT IT QUIETLY BARTLEY AS IF I WERE A FRIEND AND NOT SOME ONE WHO HAD TO BE DEFIED
lbi-1462-170142-0022 HE DROPPED BACK HEAVILY INTO HIS CHAIR BY THE FIRE
lbi-1462-170142-0023 I HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT IT UNTIL I AM WORN OUT
lbi-1462-170142-0024 AFTER THE VERY FIRST
lbi-1462-170142-0025 HILDA'S FACE QUIVERED BUT SHE WHISPERED YES I THINK IT MUST HAVE BEEN
lbi-1462-170142-0026 SHE PRESSED HIS HAND GENTLY IN GRATITUDE WEREN'T YOU HAPPY THEN AT ALL
lbi-1462-170142-0027 SOMETHING OF THEIR TROUBLING SWEETNESS CAME BACK TO ALEXANDER TOO
lbi-1462-170142-0028 PRESENTLY IT STOLE BACK TO HIS COAT SLEEVE
lbi-1462-170142-0029 YES HILDA I KNOW THAT HE SAID SIMPLY
lbi-1462-170142-0030 I UNDERSTAND BARTLEY I WAS WRONG
lbi-1462-170142-0031 SHE LISTENED INTENTLY BUT SHE HEARD NOTHING BUT THE CREAKING OF HIS CHAIR
lbi-1462-170142-0032 YOU WANT ME TO SAY IT SHE WHISPERED
lbi-1462-170142-0033 BARTLEY LEANED HIS HEAD IN HIS HANDS AND SPOKE THROUGH HIS TEETH
lbi-1462-170142-0034 IT'S GOT TO BE A CLEAN BREAK HILDA
lbi-1462-170142-0035 OH BARTLEY WHAT AM I TO DO
lbi-1462-170142-0036 YOU ASK ME TO STAY AWAY FROM YOU BECAUSE YOU WANT ME
lbi-1462-170142-0037 I WILL ASK THE LEAST IMAGINABLE BUT I MUST HAVE SOMETHING
lbi-1462-170142-0038 HILDA SAT ON THE ARM OF IT AND PUT HER HANDS LIGHTLY ON HIS SHOULDERS
lbi-1462-170142-0039 YOU SEE LOVING SOME ONE AS I LOVE YOU MAKES THE WHOLE WORLD DIFFERENT
lbi-1462-170142-0040 AND THEN YOU CAME BACK NOT CARING VERY MUCH BUT IT MADE NO DIFFERENCE
lbi-1462-170142-0041 SHE SLID TO THE FLOOR BESIDE HIM AS IF SHE WERE TOO TIRED TO SIT UP ANY LONGER
lbi-1462-170142-0042 DON'T CRY DON'T CRY HE WHISPERED
lbi-1462-170145-0000 ON THE LAST SATURDAY IN APRIL THE NEW YORK TIMES PUBLISHED AN ACCOUNT OF THE STRIKE COMPLICATIONS WHICH WERE DELAYING ALEXANDER'S NEW JERSEY BRIDGE AND STATED THAT THE ENGINEER HIMSELF WAS IN TOWN AND AT HIS OFFICE ON WEST TENTH STREET
lbi-1462-170145-0001 OVER THE FIREPLACE THERE WAS A LARGE OLD FASHIONED GILT MIRROR
lbi-1462-170145-0002 HE ROSE AND CROSSED THE ROOM QUICKLY
lbi-1462-170145-0003 OF COURSE I KNOW BARTLEY SHE SAID AT LAST THAT AFTER THIS YOU WON'T OWE ME THE LEAST CONSIDERATION BUT WE SAIL ON TUESDAY
lbi-1462-170145-0004 I SAW THAT INTERVIEW IN THE PAPER YESTERDAY TELLING WHERE YOU WERE AND I THOUGHT I HAD TO SEE YOU THAT'S ALL GOOD NIGHT I'M GOING NOW
lbi-1462-170145-0005 LET ME TAKE OFF YOUR COAT AND YOUR BOOTS THEY'RE OOZING WATER
lbi-1462-170145-0006 IF YOU'D SENT ME A NOTE OR TELEPHONED ME OR ANYTHING
lbi-1462-170145-0007 I TOLD MYSELF THAT IF I WERE REALLY THINKING OF YOU AND NOT OF MYSELF A LETTER WOULD BE BETTER THAN NOTHING
lbi-1462-170145-0008 HE PAUSED THEY NEVER DID TO ME
lbi-1462-170145-0009 OH BARTLEY DID YOU WRITE TO ME
lbi-1462-170145-0010 ALEXANDER SLIPPED HIS ARM ABOUT HER
lbi-1462-170145-0011 I THINK I HAVE FELT THAT YOU WERE COMING
lbi-1462-170145-0012 HE BENT HIS FACE OVER HER HAIR
lbi-1462-170145-0013 AND I SHE WHISPERED I FELT THAT YOU WERE FEELING THAT
lbi-1462-170145-0014 BUT WHEN I CAME I THOUGHT I HAD BEEN MISTAKEN
lbi-1462-170145-0015 I'VE BEEN UP IN CANADA WITH MY BRIDGE AND I ARRANGED NOT TO COME TO NEW YORK UNTIL AFTER YOU HAD GONE
lbi-1462-170145-0016 THEN WHEN YOUR MANAGER ADDED TWO MORE WEEKS I WAS ALREADY COMMITTED
lbi-1462-170145-0017 I'M GOING TO DO WHAT YOU ASKED ME TO DO WHEN YOU WERE IN LONDON
lbi-1462-170145-0018 ONLY I'LL DO IT MORE COMPLETELY
lbi-1462-170145-0019 THEN YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
lbi-1462-170145-0020 YES I KNOW VERY WELL
lbi-1462-170145-0021 ALEXANDER FLUSHED ANGRILY
lbi-1462-170145-0022 I DON'T KNOW WHAT I OUGHT TO SAY BUT I DON'T BELIEVE YOU'D BE HAPPY TRULY I DON'T AREN'T YOU TRYING TO FRIGHTEN ME
