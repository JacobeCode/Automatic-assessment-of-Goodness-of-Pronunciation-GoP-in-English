lbi-4515-11057-0000 YET SO STRONG WAS THE EFFECT UPON HIM OF CONTEMPLATING A LARGE FORTUNE THAT IN DESPITE OF REASON AND DESIRE HE LIVED IN EAGER EXPECTATION OF THE WORD WHICH SHOULD MAKE HIM RICH
lbi-4515-11057-0001 A PART OF THAT IMPRESSION WAS DUE TO THE ENGAGEMENT WHICH HE MUST NOW FULFIL
lbi-4515-11057-0002 TO SHUFFLE OUT OF THIS DUTY WOULD MAKE HIM TOO IGNOBLE EVEN IN HIS OWN EYES
lbi-4515-11057-0003 BECAUSE IN HIS SALAD DAYS HE DALLIED WITH A GIRL WHO HAD INDEED MANY CHARMS STEP BY STEP HE HAD COME TO THE NECESSITY OF SACRIFICING HIS PROSPECTS TO THAT RAW ATTACHMENT
lbi-4515-11057-0004 UNABLE TO THINK OF WORK HE LEFT THE HOUSE AND WANDERED GLOOMILY ABOUT REGENT'S PARK
lbi-4515-11057-0005 HE FELT HIMSELF ILL USED BY DESTINY AND THEREFORE BY MARIAN WHO WAS FATE'S INSTRUMENT
lbi-4515-11057-0006 HE WROTE TO MARIAN
lbi-4515-11057-0007 WILL YOU LET ME HEAR OR COME AND SEE ME
lbi-4515-11057-0008 I SCARCELY THOUGHT OF BIFFEN AS LIKELY TO KILL HIMSELF
lbi-4515-11057-0009 BUT WHY THE DEUCE DID HE GO ALL THE WAY OUT THERE
lbi-4515-11057-0010 I HOPED YOU WOULD BRING ME SOME NEWS
lbi-4515-11057-0011 POVERTY I CAN ONLY SUPPOSE
lbi-4515-11057-0012 BUT I WILL SEE WHELPDALE I HADN'T COME ACROSS BIFFEN FOR A LONG TIME
lbi-4515-11057-0013 WAS HE STILL SO VERY POOR
lbi-4515-11057-0014 ASKED AMY COMPASSIONATELY
lbi-4515-11057-0015 I'M AFRAID SO HIS BOOK FAILED UTTERLY
lbi-4515-11057-0016 OH IF I HAD IMAGINED HIM STILL IN SUCH DISTRESS SURELY I MIGHT HAVE DONE SOMETHING TO HELP HIM
lbi-4515-11057-0017 PERCHANCE HIS DEATH WAS IN PART ATTRIBUTABLE TO THAT HOPELESS LOVE
lbi-4515-11057-0018 HE SENT ME A COPY OF HIS NOVEL SHE SAID AND I SAW HIM ONCE OR TWICE AFTER THAT
lbi-4515-11057-0019 HAVING THIS SUBJECT TO CONVERSE UPON PUT THE TWO MORE QUICKLY AT EASE THAN COULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN THE CASE
lbi-4515-11057-0020 AMY MIGHT TAKE A FOREMOST PLACE AMONG BRILLIANT WOMEN
lbi-4515-11057-0021 ESPECIALLY NOW THAT HER FATHER IS THREATENED WITH BLINDNESS
lbi-4515-11057-0022 IS IT SO SERIOUS
lbi-4515-11057-0023 EVEN IF MISTER YULE RECOVERS HIS SIGHT IT IS NOT AT ALL LIKELY THAT HE WILL BE ABLE TO WORK AS BEFORE
lbi-4515-11057-0024 OUR DIFFICULTIES ARE SO GRAVE THAT
lbi-4515-11057-0025 HE PAUSED AND LET HIS HAND FAIL DESPONDENTLY
lbi-4515-11057-0026 I HAVE A GOOD DEAL OF WILL YOU REMEMBER AND WHAT I HAVE SET MY MIND UPON NO DOUBT I SHALL SOME DAY ACHIEVE
lbi-4515-11057-0027 THERE WAS SILENCE
lbi-4515-11057-0028 THE LAST THREE YEARS HE CONTINUED HAVE MADE NO SLIGHT DIFFERENCE IN MY POSITION
lbi-4515-11057-0029 RECALL WHERE I STOOD WHEN YOU FIRST KNEW ME
lbi-4515-11057-0030 JUST NOW I AM IN NEED OF A LITTLE ENCOURAGEMENT
lbi-4515-11057-0031 YOU DON'T NOTICE ANY FALLING OFF IN MY WORK RECENTLY
lbi-4515-11057-0032 DO YOU SEE MY THINGS IN THE CURRENT AND SO ON GENERALLY
lbi-4515-11057-0033 SOMETIMES I BELIEVE I HAVE DETECTED YOU WHEN THERE WAS NO SIGNATURE
lbi-4515-11057-0034 HER STORY IN THAT GIRLS PAPER HAS ATTRACTED ATTENTION
lbi-4515-11057-0035 AND I COULD SO EASILY PUT HER AT REST BY RENOUNCING ALL CLAIM UPON HER
lbi-4515-11057-0036 I SURMISE THAT THAT YOU YOURSELF WOULD ALSO BE PUT AT REST BY SUCH A DECISION
lbi-4515-11057-0037 DON'T LOOK AT ME WITH THAT IRONICAL SMILE HE PLEADED
lbi-4515-11057-0038 I COULDN'T GO ABOUT DECLARING THAT I WAS HEARTBROKEN IN ANY EVENT I MUST BE CONTENT FOR PEOPLE TO JUDGE ME ACCORDING TO THEIR DISPOSITION AND JUDGMENTS ARE PRETTY SURE TO BE UNFAVOURABLE WHAT CAN I DO
lbi-4515-11057-0039 THE CASE IS TOO DELICATE I FEAR FOR MY ADVICE
lbi-4515-11057-0040 WELL I'LL GO BACK TO MY SCRIBBLING
lbi-4515-11057-0041 AGAIN JASPER HELD THE WHITE SOFT HAND FOR A SUPERFLUOUS MOMENT
lbi-4515-11057-0042 YET FOR SUCH FEELINGS HE REPROACHED HIMSELF AND THE REPROACH MADE HIM ANGRY
lbi-4515-11057-0043 MARIAN COULD NOT MISTAKE THE AIR OF RESTLESS TROUBLE ON HER COMPANION'S SMOOTH COUNTENANCE
lbi-4515-11057-0044 SHE HAD DIVINED THAT THERE WAS SOME GRAVE REASON FOR THIS SUMMONS AND THE PANTING WITH WHICH SHE HAD APPROACHED WAS HALF CAUSED BY THE ANXIOUS BEATS OF HER HEART
lbi-4515-11057-0045 HE BEGAN ABRUPTLY
lbi-4515-11057-0046 HE GAVE HER SUCH DETAILS AS HE HAD OBTAINED THEN ADDED
lbi-4515-11057-0047 THERE ARE TWO OF MY COMPANIONS FALLEN IN THE BATTLE
lbi-4515-11057-0048 I OUGHT TO THINK MYSELF A LUCKY FELLOW MARIAN WHAT
lbi-4515-11057-0049 YOU ARE BETTER FITTED TO FIGHT YOUR WAY JASPER
lbi-4515-11057-0050 MORE OF A BRUTE YOU MEAN
lbi-4515-11057-0051 YOU KNOW VERY WELL I DON'T
lbi-4515-11057-0052 I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND ABOUT OUR AFFAIRS HE WENT ON PRESENTLY
lbi-4515-11057-0053 YES
lbi-4515-11057-0054 WILL YOU MARRY ME AND LET US TAKE OUR CHANCE
lbi-4515-11057-0055 YOU FEEL YOURSELF INDISPENSABLE TO YOUR FATHER AT PRESENT
lbi-4515-11057-0056 I SHOULD BE SO AFRAID OF THE EFFECT UPON HIS HEALTH JASPER
lbi-4515-11057-0057 SHE PAUSED AND LOOKED UP AT HIM TOUCHINGLY
lbi-4515-11057-0058 DEAR I CAN'T FEEL IT WOULD BE MY DUTY TO RENOUNCE YOU BECAUSE MY FATHER HAD BECOME BLIND
lbi-4515-11057-0059 HAS ONE THING OCCURRED TO YOU
lbi-4515-11057-0060 WILL HE CONSENT TO RECEIVE AN ALLOWANCE FROM A PERSON WHOSE NAME IS MISSUS MILVAIN
lbi-4515-11057-0061 AND IF HE OBSTINATELY REFUSES WHAT THEN WHAT IS BEFORE HIM
lbi-4515-11057-0062 SHE LISTENED ANXIOUSLY AND REFLECTED
lbi-4515-11057-0063 AS I HAVE SAID THERE IS THE VERY SERIOUS DOUBT WHETHER YOUR FATHER WOULD ACCEPT MONEY FROM YOU WHEN YOU ARE MY WIFE
lbi-4515-11057-0064 IT ISN'T YOUR FAULT MARIAN AND WELL THEN THERE'S ONLY ONE THING TO DO
lbi-4515-11057-0065 EXCEPT JASPER THAT IF FATHER IS HELPLESS I MUST FIND MEANS OF ASSURING HIS SUPPORT
lbi-4515-11057-0066 DO YOU THINK THEM INSURMOUNTABLE
lbi-4515-11057-0067 THAT IS JUST WHAT I HAVE DECIDED IS IMPOSSIBLE MARIAN YOU SHALL HAVE THE PLAIN TRUTH
lbi-4515-11057-0068 I DON'T TRUST MYSELF
lbi-4515-11057-0069 BUT SHALL YOU FACE THEM WILLINGLY
lbi-4515-11057-0070 PUT UP YOUR UMBRELLA MARIAN
lbi-4515-11057-0071 WHAT DO I CARE FOR A DROP OF RAIN SHE EXCLAIMED WITH PASSIONATE SADNESS WHEN ALL MY LIFE IS AT STAKE HOW AM I TO UNDERSTAND YOU
lbi-4515-11057-0072 EVERY WORD YOU SPEAK SEEMS INTENDED TO DISHEARTEN ME
lbi-4515-11057-0073 WHY NEED YOU CONCEAL IT IF THAT IS THE TRUTH
lbi-4515-11057-0074 IS THAT WHAT YOU MEAN BY SAYING YOU DISTRUST YOURSELF
lbi-4515-11057-0075 WE MUST SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN MARIAN
lbi-4515-11057-0076 HOW AM I TO LIVE AN HOUR IN SUCH UNCERTAINTY AS THIS
lbi-4515-11057-0077 I DO WISH IT
lbi-4515-11057-0078 HER EMOTION HAD AN EFFECT UPON HIM AND HIS VOICE TREMBLED
lbi-4515-11057-0079 THERE IS NO NATURAL LAW THAT A CHILD SHOULD SURRENDER EVERYTHING FOR HER PARENTS
lbi-4515-11057-0080 YOU KNOW SO MUCH MORE OF THE WORLD THAN I DO CAN'T YOU ADVISE ME
lbi-4515-11057-0081 IS THERE NO WAY OF PROVIDING FOR MY FATHER
lbi-4515-11057-0082 GOOD GOD THIS IS FRIGHTFUL MARIAN I CAN'T STAND IT
lbi-4515-11057-0083 I WILL BE FAITHFUL TO YOU
lbi-4515-11057-0084 HE HAD MADE A PRETENCE OF HOLDING HIS UMBRELLA OVER HER BUT MARIAN TURNED AWAY AND WALKED TO A LITTLE DISTANCE AND STOOD BENEATH THE SHELTER OF A GREAT TREE HER FACE AVERTED FROM HIM
lbi-4515-11057-0085 MOVING TO FOLLOW HE SAW THAT HER FRAME WAS SHAKEN BY SOUNDLESS SOBBING
lbi-4515-11057-0086 IN WHAT CAN THERE BE MORE SELFISHNESS
lbi-4515-11057-0087 BUT I COULDN'T SAY A WORD THAT WOULD SEEM TO INVITE SUCH MISERY AS THIS
lbi-4515-11057-0088 YOU DON'T LOVE ME JASPER AND THAT'S AN END OF EVERYTHING
lbi-4515-11057-0089 HAPPINESS OR MISERY COME TO US BY FATE
lbi-4515-11057-0090 IS IT IN MY POWER TO MAKE YOU HAPPY
lbi-4515-11057-0091 BUT IF YOU HAD SAID YOU LOVED ME BEFORE THAT I SHOULD HAVE IT ALWAYS TO REMEMBER
lbi-4515-11057-0092 IF I BELIEVE ANYTHING I BELIEVE THAT I DID LOVE YOU
lbi-4515-11057-0093 WHAT CAN YOU SAY TO ME MORE THAN YOU HAVE SAID NOW
lbi-4515-11057-0094 REMEMBER ME AS A MAN WHO DISREGARDED PRICELESS LOVE SUCH AS YOURS TO GO AND MAKE HIMSELF A PROUD POSITION AMONG FOOLS AND KNAVES INDEED THAT'S WHAT IT COMES TO
lbi-4515-11057-0095 SOON ENOUGH YOU WOULD THOROUGHLY DESPISE ME AND THOUGH I SHOULD KNOW IT WAS MERITED MY PERVERSE PRIDE WOULD REVOLT AGAINST IT
lbi-4515-11057-0096 WHAT CAN BE SIMPLER THAN THE TRUTH
lbi-4515-11057-0097 IT IS A THING THAT HAPPENS EVERY DAY EITHER IN MAN OR WOMAN AND ALL THAT HONOUR DEMANDS IS THE COURAGE TO CONFESS THE TRUTH
lbi-4515-11057-0098 MARIAN WILL YOU DO THIS WILL YOU LET OUR ENGAGEMENT LAST FOR ANOTHER SIX MONTHS BUT WITHOUT OUR MEETING DURING THAT TIME
lbi-4515-11057-0099 THAT SEEMS TO ME CHILDISH
lbi-4515-11057-0100 THE RAIN FELL UNCEASINGLY AND WITH IT BEGAN TO MINGLE AN AUTUMNAL MIST
lbi-4515-11057-0101 JASPER DELAYED A MOMENT THEN ASKED CALMLY
lbi-4515-11057-0102 ARE YOU GOING TO THE MUSEUM YES
lbi-4515-11057-0103 GO HOME AGAIN FOR THIS MORNING MARIAN YOU CAN'T WORK
lbi-4515-11057-0104 I MUST AND I HAVE NO TIME TO LOSE
lbi-4515-11057-0105 GOOD BYE SHE GAVE HIM HER HAND
lbi-4515-11057-0106 THEY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER FOR AN INSTANT THEN MARIAN LEFT THE SHELTER OF THE TREE OPENED HER UMBRELLA AND WALKED QUICKLY AWAY
lbi-4515-11057-0107 JASPER DID NOT WATCH HER HE HAD THE FACE OF A MAN WHO IS SUFFERING A SEVERE HUMILIATION
lbi-4515-11057-0108 HIS SISTER SAID VERY LITTLE FOR SHE RECOGNISED GENUINE SUFFERING IN HIS TONES AND ASPECT
lbi-4515-11057-0109 A FEW WEEKS AGO HE ACTUALLY PROPOSED TO A WOMAN FOR WHOM HE DOES NOT PRETEND TO HAVE THE SLIGHTEST AFFECTION BUT WHO IS VERY RICH AND WHO SEEMED LIKELY TO BE FOOLISH ENOUGH TO MARRY HIM
lbi-4515-11057-0110 YESTERDAY MORNING HE RECEIVED HER FINAL ANSWER A REFUSAL
lbi-4515-11057-0111 YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THOUGH SURELY YOU NEED NO FRESH PROOF HOW UTTERLY UNWORTHY HE IS OF YOU
lbi-4515-11057-0112 YOU ARE THE ONLY FRIEND I HAVE OF MY OWN SEX AND I COULD NOT BEAR TO LOSE YOU
lbi-4515-11057-0113 SEVERAL DAYS PASSED BEFORE THERE CAME A REPLY
lbi-4515-11057-0114 I MUST ONLY ASK THAT YOU WILL WRITE TO ME WITHOUT THE LEAST REFERENCE TO THESE TROUBLES TELL ME ALWAYS ABOUT YOURSELF AND BE SURE THAT YOU CANNOT TELL ME TOO MUCH
lbi-4570-102353-0000 WE HAD THEN BUT LITTLE OF THAT MINUTE AND ACCURATE KNOWLEDGE OF THE INTERIOR OF THE CONTINENT WHICH WAS REQUISITE FOR A DETERMINATION OF THE PROBLEM
lbi-4570-102353-0001 SEVERAL DIFFERENT PARTIES WERE THEREFORE ORGANIZED TO EXAMINE THE VARIOUS ROUTES SUPPOSED TO BE PRACTICABLE WITHIN THE NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN LIMITS OF THE UNITED STATES
lbi-4570-102353-0002 THE ONLY DISCRIMINATION MADE WAS IN THE MORE PROMPT AND THOROUGH EQUIPMENT OF THE PARTIES FOR THE EXTREME NORTHERN LINE AND THIS WAS ONLY BECAUSE THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE MOST DIFFICULT OF EXECUTION OF ALL THE SURVEYS
lbi-4570-102353-0003 INQUIRIES WERE MADE WITH REGARD TO GUNPOWDER WHICH SUBSEQUENTLY LED TO THE USE OF A COARSER GRAIN FOR ARTILLERY
lbi-4570-102353-0004 THE OFFICERS OF THESE REGIMENTS WERE CHOSEN PARTLY BY SELECTION FROM THOSE ALREADY IN SERVICE IN THE REGULAR ARMY AND PARTLY BY APPOINTMENT FROM CIVIL LIFE
lbi-4570-102353-0005 UNDER INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE PRESIDENT THE LIST WAS THEREFORE REVISED AND MODIFIED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS NEW ELEMENT OF GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION
lbi-4570-102353-0006 AFTER SOME FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE QUESTION THE VISITORS WITHDREW DISSATISFIED WITH THE RESULT OF THE INTERVIEW
lbi-4570-102353-0007 THE QUARTERMASTER GENERAL ON HEARING OF THIS CONVERSATION HASTENED TO INFORM ME THAT IT WAS ALL A MISTAKE THAT THE APPOINTEE TO THE OFFICE HAD BEEN CONFOUNDED WITH HIS FATHER WHO WAS A WELL KNOWN WHIG BUT THAT HE THE SON WAS A DEMOCRAT
lbi-4570-102353-0008 I ASSURED THE GENERAL THAT THIS WAS ALTOGETHER IMMATERIAL ADDING THAT IT WAS A VERY PRETTY QUARREL AS IT STOOD AND THAT I HAD NO DESIRE TO EFFECT A SETTLEMENT OF IT ON ANY INFERIOR ISSUE
lbi-4570-14911-0000 NEVERTHELESS IN GENERAL APPEARANCE THE HARRIER AND THE FOXHOUND ARE VERY MUCH ALIKE THE ONE OBVIOUS DISTINCTION BEING THAT OF SIZE
lbi-4570-14911-0001 IF YOU WANT TO HUNT YOUR HARRIERS ON FOOT SIXTEEN INCHES IS QUITE BIG ENOUGH ALMOST TOO BIG TO RUN WITH BUT IF YOU ARE RIDING TO THEM TWENTY INCHES IS A USEFUL HEIGHT OR EVEN NINETEEN INCHES
lbi-4570-14911-0002 IT IS USELESS TO LAY DOWN ANY HARD AND FAST RULE AS TO COLOUR IT IS SO MUCH A MATTER OF INDIVIDUAL TASTE
lbi-4570-14911-0003 BUT PUPPIES ARE USUALLY SENT OUT TO WALK AND MAY EASILY BE PROCURED TO BE KEPT AND REARED UNTIL THEY ARE OLD ENOUGH TO BE ENTERED TO THEIR WORK
lbi-4570-14911-0004 HE IS OF COURSE FINER BUT WITH THE LENGTH OF NECK SO PERFECT IN THE BIGGER HOUND THE LITTLE SHOULDERS OF THE SAME PATTERN AND THE TYPICAL QUARTERS AND SECOND THIGHS
lbi-4570-14911-0005 AND WHEN HE IS FAIRLY ON A LINE OF COURSE HE STICKS TO IT AS THE SAYING IS LIKE A BEAGLE
lbi-4570-14911-0006 IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THEREFORE THAT THE BEAGLE WAS CROSSED WITH THE WELSH SOUTHERN OR OTTERHOUND TO GET MORE SIZE AND POWER AS THERE CERTAINLY WAS A WELSH ROUGH COATED BEAGLE OF GOOD EIGHTEEN INCHES AND AN ALMOST IDENTICAL CONTEMPORARY THAT WAS CALLED THE ESSEX BEAGLE
lbi-4570-14911-0007 THAT A GREAT MANY OF THE TRUE ORDER WERE BRED BECAME VERY MANIFEST AS SOON AS THE HARRIER AND BEAGLE ASSOCIATION WAS FORMED AND MORE PARTICULARLY WHEN A SECTION OF THE PETERBOROUGH HOUND SHOW WAS RESERVED FOR THEM
lbi-4570-14911-0008 THEN THEY SEEMED TO SPRING FROM EVERY PART OF THE COUNTRY
lbi-4570-14911-0009 ONE HEARS NOW OF THE CHAUSTON THE HALSTEAD PLACE VERY NOTED INDEED THE HULTON THE LEIGH PARK THE STOKE PLACE THE EDINBURGH THE SURBITON THE TRINITY FOOT THE WOODDALE MISSUS G W HILLIARD'S MISSUS PRICE'S AND MISSUS TURNER'S
lbi-4570-14911-0010 EYES BROWN DARK HAZEL OR HAZEL NOT DEEP SET NOR BULGY AND WITH A MILD EXPRESSION
lbi-4570-14911-0011 EARS LONG SET ON LOW FINE IN TEXTURE AND HANGING IN A GRACEFUL FOLD CLOSE TO THE CHEEK
lbi-4570-14911-0012 NECK MODERATELY LONG SLIGHTLY ARCHED THE THROAT SHOWING SOME DEWLAP
lbi-4570-14911-0013 SHOULDERS CLEAN AND SLIGHTLY SLOPING
lbi-4570-14911-0014 FORE LEGS QUITE STRAIGHT WELL UNDER THE DOG OF GOOD SUBSTANCE AND ROUND IN THE BONE
lbi-4570-14911-0015 FEET ROUND WELL KNUCKLED UP AND STRONGLY PADDED
lbi-4570-14911-0016 COAT SMOOTH VARIETY SMOOTH VERY DENSE AND NOT TOO FINE OR SHORT
lbi-4570-14911-0017 HEIGHT NOT EXCEEDING SIXTEEN INCHES
lbi-4570-24733-0000 ALL THINGS WHICH FOLLOW FROM THE ABSOLUTE NATURE OF ANY ATTRIBUTE OF GOD MUST ALWAYS EXIST AND BE INFINITE OR IN OTHER WORDS ARE ETERNAL AND INFINITE THROUGH THE SAID ATTRIBUTE
lbi-4570-24733-0001 PROOF CONCEIVE IF IT BE POSSIBLE SUPPOSING THE PROPOSITION TO BE DENIED THAT SOMETHING IN SOME ATTRIBUTE OF GOD CAN FOLLOW FROM THE ABSOLUTE NATURE OF THE SAID ATTRIBUTE AND THAT AT THE SAME TIME IT IS FINITE AND HAS A CONDITIONED EXISTENCE OR DURATION FOR INSTANCE THE IDEA OF GOD EXPRESSED IN THE ATTRIBUTE THOUGHT
lbi-4570-24733-0002 IN ITS NATURE INFINITE
lbi-4570-24733-0003 MUST NECESSARILY EXIST
lbi-4570-24733-0004 WE HAVE NOW GRANTED THEREFORE THOUGHT NOT CONSTITUTING THE IDEA OF GOD AND ACCORDINGLY THE IDEA OF GOD DOES NOT NATURALLY FOLLOW FROM ITS NATURE IN SO FAR AS IT IS ABSOLUTE THOUGHT FOR IT IS CONCEIVED AS CONSTITUTING AND ALSO AS NOT CONSTITUTING THE IDEA OF GOD WHICH IS AGAINST OUR HYPOTHESIS
lbi-4570-24733-0005 AND BEYOND THE LIMITS OF THE DURATION OF THE IDEA OF GOD SUPPOSING THE LATTER AT SOME TIME NOT TO HAVE EXISTED OR NOT TO BE GOING TO EXIST THOUGHT WOULD PERFORCE HAVE EXISTED WITHOUT THE IDEA OF GOD WHICH IS CONTRARY TO OUR HYPOTHESIS FOR WE SUPPOSED THAT THOUGHT BEING GIVEN THE IDEA OF GOD NECESSARILY FLOWED THEREFROM
lbi-4570-24733-0006 BEAR IN MIND THAT THE SAME PROPOSITION MAY BE AFFIRMED OF ANYTHING WHICH IN ANY ATTRIBUTE NECESSARILY FOLLOWS FROM GOD'S ABSOLUTE NATURE
lbi-4570-24733-0007 COROLLARY HENCE IT FOLLOWS THAT GOD IS NOT ONLY THE CAUSE OF THINGS COMING INTO EXISTENCE BUT ALSO OF THEIR CONTINUING IN EXISTENCE THAT IS IN SCHOLASTIC PHRASEOLOGY GOD IS CAUSE OF THE BEING OF THINGS ESSENDI RERUM
lbi-4570-24733-0008 COROLLARY INDIVIDUAL THINGS ARE NOTHING BUT MODIFICATIONS OF THE ATTRIBUTES OF GOD OR MODES BY WHICH THE ATTRIBUTES OF GOD ARE EXPRESSED IN A FIXED AND DEFINITE MANNER
lbi-4570-56594-0000 SUCH A CORPS SUCH A TIME YOU NEVER DID SEE
lbi-4570-56594-0001 I WAS WISHING SOMEBODY WOULD GIVE THE CONVERSATION A START WHEN INDIANY MADE A BREAK
lbi-4570-56594-0002 THIS AIN'T NO GREAT STOCK COUNTRY SAYS HE TO THE OLD GENTLEMAN WITH THE CANE
lbi-4570-56594-0003 NO SIR SAYS THE OLD GENTLEMAN
lbi-4570-56594-0004 THERE'S VERY LITTLE GRAZING HERE AND THE RANGE IS PRETTY MUCH WORE OUT
lbi-4570-56594-0005 THE YOUNG LADY SMILED THROUGH HER VEIL AND THE OLD LADY SNAPPED HER EYES AND LOOKED SIDEWAYS AT THE SPEAKER
lbi-4570-56594-0006 I'M GWINE DOWN TO ORLEANS TO SEE IF I CAN'T GIT A CONTRACT OUT OF UNCLE SAM TO FEED THE BOYS WHAT'S BEEN LICKIN THEM INFERNAL MEXICANS SO BAD
lbi-4570-56594-0007 I'VE READ SOME ACCOUNTS OF THE BATTLE SAYS THE OLD GENTLEMAN THAT DIDN'T GIVE A VERY FLATTERING ACCOUNT OF THE CONDUCT OF SOME OF OUR TROOPS
lbi-4570-56594-0008 THE OLD PREACHER LISTENED TO HIM WITH EVIDENT SIGNS OF DISPLEASURE TWISTIN AND GROANIN TILL HE COULDN'T STAND IT NO LONGER
lbi-4570-56594-0009 HE SHUT HIS MOUTH RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF WHAT HE WAS SAYIN AND LOOKED AT THE PREACHER WHILE HIS FACE GOT AS RED AS FIRE
lbi-4570-56594-0010 SWEARIN SAYS THE OLD PREACHER IS A TERRIBLE BAD PRACTICE AND THERE AIN'T NO USE IN IT NOHOW
lbi-4570-56594-0011 UMPHS BUT INDIANY KEPT SHADY HE APPEARED TO BE COWED DOWN
lbi-4570-56594-0012 THE OLD GENTLEMAN WITH THE CANE TOOK A PART IN THE CONVERSATION AND THE HOOSIER LISTENED WITHOUT EVER OPENING HIS HEAD
lbi-4570-56594-0013 HE WAS AT SODOM AND GOMORROW AND SEEN THE PLACE WHAR LOT'S WIFE FELL AH
lbi-4570-56594-0014 YES SAYS THE PREACHER HE WENT TO THE VERY SPOT AND WHAT'S THE REMARKABLEST THING OF ALL HE SEEN THE PILLAR OF SALT WHAT SHE WAS TURNED INTO
lbi-4570-56594-0015 YES SIR HE SEEN THE SALT STANDIN THAR TO THIS DAY

lbi-4570-56594-0018 RIGHT OUT IN THE OPEN AIR HE ASKED
