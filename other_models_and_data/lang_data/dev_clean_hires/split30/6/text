lbi-1993-147964-0000 THEY SAT ABOUT THE HOUSE MOST OF THE DAY AS IF IT WERE SUNDAY GREASING THEIR BOOTS MENDING THEIR SUSPENDERS PLAITING WHIPLASHES
lbi-1993-147964-0001 ANYWAY HE WOULD NEVER ALLOW ONE OF HIS HORSES TO BE PUT TO SUCH A STRAIN
lbi-1993-147964-0002 I HAD WANTED TO GET SOME PICTURE BOOKS FOR YULKA AND ANTONIA EVEN YULKA WAS ABLE TO READ A LITTLE NOW
lbi-1993-147964-0003 SHE CUT SQUARES OF COTTON CLOTH AND WE SEWED THEM TOGETHER INTO A BOOK
lbi-1993-147964-0004 ON THE WHITE PAGES I GROUPED SUNDAY SCHOOL CARDS AND ADVERTISING CARDS WHICH I HAD BROUGHT FROM MY OLD COUNTRY
lbi-1993-147964-0005 WHEN HE MOUNTED HIS HORSE AT THE DOOR I SAW THAT HE HAD A HATCHET SLUNG TO HIS BELT AND HE GAVE GRANDMOTHER A MEANING LOOK WHICH TOLD ME HE WAS PLANNING A SURPRISE FOR ME
lbi-1993-147964-0006 I PUT ON MY CAP AND RAN OUT TO MEET JAKE
lbi-1993-147964-0007 HE USED TO HELP MY FATHER CUT CHRISTMAS TREES FOR ME IN VIRGINIA AND HE HAD NOT FORGOTTEN HOW MUCH I LIKED THEM
lbi-1993-147964-0008 BY THE TIME WE HAD PLACED THE COLD FRESH SMELLING LITTLE TREE IN A CORNER OF THE SITTING ROOM IT WAS ALREADY CHRISTMAS EVE
lbi-1993-147964-0009 FROM UNDER THE LINING HE NOW PRODUCED A COLLECTION OF BRILLIANTLY COLORED PAPER FIGURES SEVERAL INCHES HIGH AND STIFF ENOUGH TO STAND ALONE
lbi-1993-147964-0010 I CAN SEE THEM NOW EXACTLY AS THEY LOOKED WORKING ABOUT THE TABLE IN THE LAMPLIGHT JAKE WITH HIS HEAVY FEATURES SO RUDELY MOULDED THAT HIS FACE SEEMED SOMEHOW UNFINISHED OTTO WITH HIS HALF EAR AND THE SAVAGE SCAR THAT MADE HIS UPPER LIP CURL SO FEROCIOUSLY UNDER HIS TWISTED MUSTACHE
lbi-1993-147965-0000 GRANDFATHER CAME DOWN WEARING A WHITE SHIRT AND HIS SUNDAY COAT
lbi-1993-147965-0001 MORNING PRAYERS WERE LONGER THAN USUAL
lbi-1993-147965-0002 HE GAVE THANKS FOR OUR FOOD AND COMFORT AND PRAYED FOR THE POOR AND DESTITUTE IN GREAT CITIES WHERE THE STRUGGLE FOR LIFE WAS HARDER THAN IT WAS HERE WITH US
lbi-1993-147965-0003 BECAUSE HE TALKED SO LITTLE HIS WORDS HAD A PECULIAR FORCE THEY WERE NOT WORN DULL FROM CONSTANT USE
lbi-1993-147965-0004 ALL AFTERNOON HE SAT IN THE DINING ROOM
lbi-1993-147965-0005 AT ABOUT FOUR O'CLOCK A VISITOR APPEARED MISTER SHIMERDA WEARING HIS RABBIT SKIN CAP AND COLLAR AND NEW MITTENS HIS WIFE HAD KNITTED
lbi-1993-147965-0006 HE SAT STILL AND PASSIVE HIS HEAD RESTING AGAINST THE BACK OF THE WOODEN ROCKING CHAIR HIS HANDS RELAXED UPON THE ARMS
lbi-1993-147965-0007 HIS FACE HAD A LOOK OF WEARINESS AND PLEASURE LIKE THAT OF SICK PEOPLE WHEN THEY FEEL RELIEF FROM PAIN
lbi-1993-147965-0008 HE MADE THE SIGN OF THE CROSS OVER ME PUT ON HIS CAP AND WENT OFF IN THE DARK
lbi-1993-147966-0000 THE WEEK FOLLOWING CHRISTMAS BROUGHT IN A THAW AND BY NEW YEAR'S DAY ALL THE WORLD ABOUT US WAS A BROTH OF GRAY SLUSH AND THE GUTTERED SLOPE BETWEEN THE WINDMILL AND THE BARN WAS RUNNING BLACK WATER
lbi-1993-147966-0001 IT WAS THE FIRST TIME MISSUS SHIMERDA HAD BEEN TO OUR HOUSE AND SHE RAN ABOUT EXAMINING OUR CARPETS AND CURTAINS AND FURNITURE ALL THE WHILE COMMENTING UPON THEM TO HER DAUGHTER IN AN ENVIOUS COMPLAINING TONE
lbi-1993-147966-0002 YOUR MAMA I SAID ANGRILY WANTS OTHER PEOPLE'S THINGS
lbi-1993-147966-0003 FOR AMBROSCH MY MAMA COME HERE
lbi-1993-147966-0004 BUT YOU SEE A BODY NEVER KNOWS WHAT TRAITS POVERTY MIGHT BRING OUT IN EM
lbi-1993-147966-0005 THEY BEGAN TO LAUGH BOISTEROUSLY WHEN THEY SAW ME CALLING
lbi-1993-147966-0006 YOU'VE GOT A BIRTHDAY PRESENT THIS TIME JIM AND NO MISTAKE
lbi-2035-147960-0000 SHE WAS FOUR YEARS OLDER THAN I TO BE SURE AND HAD SEEN MORE OF THE WORLD BUT I WAS A BOY AND SHE WAS A GIRL AND I RESENTED HER PROTECTING MANNER
lbi-2035-147960-0001 THIS CHANGE CAME ABOUT FROM AN ADVENTURE WE HAD TOGETHER
lbi-2035-147960-0002 ONE DAY WHEN I RODE OVER TO THE SHIMERDAS I FOUND ANTONIA STARTING OFF ON FOOT FOR RUSSIAN PETER'S HOUSE TO BORROW A SPADE AMBROSCH NEEDED
lbi-2035-147960-0003 THERE HAD BEEN ANOTHER BLACK FROST THE NIGHT BEFORE AND THE AIR WAS CLEAR AND HEADY AS WINE
lbi-2035-147960-0004 IT WAS ON ONE OF THESE GRAVEL BEDS THAT I MET MY ADVENTURE
lbi-2035-147960-0005 I WHIRLED ROUND AND THERE ON ONE OF THOSE DRY GRAVEL BEDS WAS THE BIGGEST SNAKE I HAD EVER SEEN
lbi-2035-147960-0006 I KNOW I AM JUST AWFUL JIM I WAS SO SCARED
lbi-2035-147960-0007 I NEVER KNOW YOU WAS SO BRAVE JIM SHE WENT ON COMFORTINGLY
lbi-2035-147960-0008 A FAINT FETID SMELL CAME FROM HIM AND A THREAD OF GREEN LIQUID OOZED FROM HIS CRUSHED HEAD
lbi-2035-147960-0009 LOOK TONY THAT'S HIS POISON I SAID
lbi-2035-147960-0010 I EXPLAINED TO ANTONIA HOW THIS MEANT THAT HE WAS TWENTY FOUR YEARS OLD THAT HE MUST HAVE BEEN THERE WHEN WHITE MEN FIRST CAME LEFT ON FROM BUFFALO AND INDIAN TIMES
lbi-2035-147960-0011 WE DECIDED THAT ANTONIA SHOULD RIDE DUDE HOME AND I WOULD WALK
lbi-2035-147960-0012 I FOLLOWED WITH THE SPADE OVER MY SHOULDER DRAGGING MY SNAKE
lbi-2035-147960-0013 OTTO FUCHS WAS THE FIRST ONE WE MET
lbi-2035-147960-0014 HE COULD STAND RIGHT UP AND TALK TO YOU HE COULD DID HE FIGHT HARD
lbi-2035-147960-0015 OTTO WINKED AT ME
lbi-2035-147960-0016 A SNAKE OF HIS SIZE IN FIGHTING TRIM WOULD BE MORE THAN ANY BOY COULD HANDLE
lbi-2035-147961-0000 PETER TOLD HIS TROUBLES TO MISTER SHIMERDA HE WAS UNABLE TO MEET A NOTE WHICH FELL DUE ON THE FIRST OF NOVEMBER HAD TO PAY AN EXORBITANT BONUS ON RENEWING IT AND TO GIVE A MORTGAGE ON HIS PIGS AND HORSES AND EVEN HIS MILK COW
lbi-2035-147961-0001 PETER COULD GIVE NO VERY CLEAR ACCOUNT OF HIS TRANSACTIONS WITH CUTTER
lbi-2035-147961-0002 SHE ASKED PETER TO WAIT A MOMENT AND WHEN SHE CAME BACK FROM THE KITCHEN SHE BROUGHT A BAG OF SANDWICHES AND DOUGHNUTS FOR US
lbi-2035-147961-0003 WE LAY STILL AND DID NOT TALK
lbi-2035-147961-0004 THE LITTLE HOUSE ON THE HILLSIDE WAS SO MUCH THE COLOR OF THE NIGHT THAT WE COULD NOT SEE IT AS WE CAME UP THE DRAW
lbi-2035-147961-0005 THEY MADE ME THINK OF DEFEATED ARMIES RETREATING OR OF GHOSTS WHO WERE TRYING DESPERATELY TO GET IN FOR SHELTER AND THEN WENT MOANING ON
lbi-2035-147961-0006 I COULD NOT TAKE MY EYES OFF THE MAN IN THE BED
lbi-2035-147961-0007 THE SHARP SMELL OF SPIRITS WENT THROUGH THE ROOM
lbi-2035-147961-0008 IT SEEMED TO ME THAT HE DESPISED HIM FOR BEING SO SIMPLE AND DOCILE
lbi-2035-147961-0009 THE SICK MAN RAGED AND SHOOK HIS FIST
lbi-2035-147961-0010 HE SEEMED TO BE CURSING PEOPLE WHO HAD WRONGED HIM
lbi-2035-147961-0011 QUICKLY IT WAS COVERED WITH BRIGHT RED SPOTS I THOUGHT I HAD NEVER SEEN ANY BLOOD SO BRIGHT
lbi-2035-147961-0012 HE LAY PATIENTLY FIGHTING FOR BREATH LIKE A CHILD WITH CROUP
lbi-2035-147961-0013 ANTONIA'S FATHER UNCOVERED ONE OF HIS LONG BONY LEGS AND RUBBED IT RHYTHMICALLY
lbi-2035-147961-0014 FROM OUR BENCH WE COULD SEE WHAT A HOLLOW CASE HIS BODY WAS
lbi-2035-147961-0015 GRADUALLY RELIEF CAME TO ALL OF US
lbi-2035-147961-0016 WITHOUT A WORD PETER GOT UP AND LIT HIS LANTERN
lbi-2035-147961-0017 MISTER SHIMERDA WENT WITH HIM
lbi-2035-147961-0018 AFTER THE CEREMONY AT THE CHURCH THE PARTY WENT TO A DINNER GIVEN BY THE PARENTS OF THE BRIDE
lbi-2035-147961-0019 THE FIRST HOWLS WERE TAKEN UP AND ECHOED AND WITH QUICKENING REPETITIONS
lbi-2035-147961-0020 A BLACK DROVE CAME UP OVER THE HILL BEHIND THE WEDDING PARTY
lbi-2035-147961-0021 SOMETHING HAPPENED TO THE HINDMOST SLEDGE THE DRIVER LOST CONTROL HE WAS PROBABLY VERY DRUNK THE HORSES LEFT THE ROAD THE SLEDGE WAS CAUGHT IN A CLUMP OF TREES AND OVERTURNED
lbi-2035-147961-0022 THE SHRIEKS THAT FOLLOWED MADE EVERYBODY SOBER
lbi-2035-147961-0023 THE ROAD WAS CLEAR AND WHITE AND THE GROOM'S THREE BLACKS WENT LIKE THE WIND
lbi-2035-147961-0024 THERE ARE ONLY THREE SLEDGES LEFT HE WHISPERED
lbi-2035-147961-0025 AND THE WOLVES PAVEL ASKED ENOUGH ENOUGH FOR ALL OF US
lbi-2035-147961-0026 THEY WERE WITHIN A FEW MILES OF THEIR VILLAGE NOW
lbi-2035-147961-0027 YES HOW MANY
lbi-2035-147961-0028 TWENTY THIRTY ENOUGH
lbi-2035-147961-0029 NOW HIS MIDDLE HORSE WAS BEING ALMOST DRAGGED BY THE OTHER TWO
lbi-2035-147961-0030 PAVEL KNOCKED HIM OVER THE SIDE OF THE SLEDGE AND THREW THE GIRL AFTER HIM
lbi-2035-147961-0031 PETER CROUCHING IN THE FRONT SEAT SAW NOTHING
lbi-2035-147961-0032 THE FIRST THING EITHER OF THEM NOTICED WAS A NEW SOUND THAT BROKE INTO THE CLEAR AIR LOUDER THAN THEY HAD EVER HEARD IT BEFORE THE BELL OF THE MONASTERY OF THEIR OWN VILLAGE RINGING FOR EARLY PRAYERS
lbi-2035-147961-0033 THEY WERE RUN OUT OF THEIR VILLAGE
lbi-2035-147961-0034 WHEREVER THEY WENT THE STORY FOLLOWED THEM
lbi-2035-147961-0035 THEY WORKED IN CHICAGO DES MOINES FORT WAYNE BUT THEY WERE ALWAYS UNFORTUNATE
lbi-2035-147961-0036 DURING THE AUCTION HE WENT ABOUT WITH HIS HEAD DOWN AND NEVER LIFTED HIS EYES
lbi-2035-147961-0037 EVERY ONE SAID PETER KISSED THE COW BEFORE SHE WAS LED AWAY BY HER NEW OWNER
lbi-2035-147961-0038 THE LOSS OF HIS TWO FRIENDS HAD A DEPRESSING EFFECT UPON OLD MISTER SHIMERDA
lbi-2035-147961-0039 WHEN HE WAS OUT HUNTING HE USED TO GO INTO THE EMPTY LOG HOUSE AND SIT THERE BROODING
lbi-2035-147961-0040 THIS CABIN WAS HIS HERMITAGE UNTIL THE WINTER SNOWS PENNED HIM IN HIS CAVE
