lbi-1701-141760-0000 THE PAVLOGRADS HELD FEAST AFTER FEAST CELEBRATING AWARDS THEY HAD RECEIVED FOR THE CAMPAIGN AND MADE EXPEDITIONS TO OLMUTZ TO VISIT A CERTAIN CAROLINE THE HUNGARIAN WHO HAD RECENTLY OPENED A RESTAURANT THERE WITH GIRLS AS WAITRESSES
lbi-1701-141760-0001 THE GUARDS HAD MADE THEIR WHOLE MARCH AS IF ON A PLEASURE TRIP PARADING THEIR CLEANLINESS AND DISCIPLINE
lbi-1701-141760-0002 THE REGIMENTS HAD ENTERED AND LEFT THE TOWN WITH THEIR BANDS PLAYING AND BY THE GRAND DUKE'S ORDERS THE MEN HAD MARCHED ALL THE WAY IN STEP A PRACTICE ON WHICH THE GUARDS PRIDED THEMSELVES THE OFFICERS ON FOOT AND AT THEIR PROPER POSTS
lbi-1701-141760-0003 BORIS HAD BEEN QUARTERED AND HAD MARCHED ALL THE WAY WITH BERG WHO WAS ALREADY IN COMMAND OF A COMPANY
lbi-1701-141760-0004 BORIS DURING THE CAMPAIGN HAD MADE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF MANY PERSONS WHO MIGHT PROVE USEFUL TO HIM AND BY A LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION HE HAD BROUGHT FROM PIERRE HAD BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH PRINCE ANDREW BOLKONSKI THROUGH WHOM HE HOPED TO OBTAIN A POST ON THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF'S STAFF
lbi-1701-141760-0005 BERG AND BORIS HAVING RESTED AFTER YESTERDAY'S MARCH WERE SITTING CLEAN AND NEATLY DRESSED AT A ROUND TABLE IN THE CLEAN QUARTERS ALLOTTED TO THEM PLAYING CHESS
lbi-1701-141760-0006 WELL HOW ARE YOU GOING TO GET OUT OF THAT HE REMARKED
lbi-1701-141760-0007 AT THAT MOMENT THE DOOR OPENED
lbi-1701-141760-0008 DEAR ME HOW YOU HAVE CHANGED
lbi-1701-141760-0009 HE WAS ABOUT TO EMBRACE HIS FRIEND BUT NICHOLAS AVOIDED HIM
lbi-1701-141760-0010 HE WANTED TO PINCH HIM PUSH HIM DO ANYTHING BUT KISS HIM A THING EVERYBODY DID
lbi-1701-141760-0011 BUT NOTWITHSTANDING THIS BORIS EMBRACED HIM IN A QUIET FRIENDLY WAY AND KISSED HIM THREE TIMES
lbi-1701-141760-0012 THEY HAD NOT MET FOR NEARLY HALF A YEAR AND BEING AT THE AGE WHEN YOUNG MEN TAKE THEIR FIRST STEPS ON LIFE'S ROAD EACH SAW IMMENSE CHANGES IN THE OTHER QUITE A NEW REFLECTION OF THE SOCIETY IN WHICH THEY HAD TAKEN THOSE FIRST STEPS
lbi-1701-141760-0013 I DID NOT EXPECT YOU TODAY HE ADDED
lbi-1701-141760-0014 YOU KNOW OF COURSE THAT HIS IMPERIAL HIGHNESS RODE WITH OUR REGIMENT ALL THE TIME SO THAT WE HAD EVERY COMFORT AND EVERY ADVANTAGE
lbi-1701-141760-0015 WHAT RECEPTIONS WE HAD IN POLAND
lbi-1701-141760-0016 WHAT DINNERS AND BALLS I CAN'T TELL YOU
lbi-1701-141760-0017 OH YOU GUARDS SAID ROSTOV I SAY SEND FOR SOME WINE
lbi-1701-141760-0018 HE WENT TO HIS BED DREW A PURSE FROM UNDER THE CLEAN PILLOW AND SENT FOR WINE
lbi-1701-141760-0019 YES AND I HAVE SOME MONEY AND A LETTER TO GIVE YOU HE ADDED
lbi-1701-141760-0020 OH DON'T MENTION IT COUNT I QUITE UNDERSTAND SAID BERG GETTING UP AND SPEAKING IN A MUFFLED AND GUTTURAL VOICE
lbi-1701-141760-0021 GO ACROSS TO OUR HOSTS THEY INVITED YOU ADDED BORIS
lbi-1701-141760-0022 BERG PUT ON THE CLEANEST OF COATS WITHOUT A SPOT OR SPECK OF DUST STOOD BEFORE A LOOKING GLASS AND BRUSHED THE HAIR ON HIS TEMPLES UPWARDS IN THE WAY AFFECTED BY THE EMPEROR ALEXANDER AND HAVING ASSURED HIMSELF FROM THE WAY ROSTOV LOOKED AT IT THAT HIS COAT HAD BEEN NOTICED LEFT THE ROOM WITH A PLEASANT SMILE
lbi-1701-141760-0023 OH DEAR WHAT A BEAST I AM MUTTERED ROSTOV AS HE READ THE LETTER WHY
lbi-1701-141760-0024 WELL HAVE YOU SENT GABRIEL FOR SOME WINE ALL RIGHT LET'S HAVE SOME
lbi-1701-141760-0025 IN THE LETTER FROM HIS PARENTS WAS ENCLOSED A LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION TO BAGRATION WHICH THE OLD COUNTESS AT ANNA MIKHAYLOVNA'S ADVICE HAD OBTAINED THROUGH AN ACQUAINTANCE AND SENT TO HER SON ASKING HIM TO TAKE IT TO ITS DESTINATION AND MAKE USE OF IT
lbi-1701-141760-0026 WHY HAVE YOU THROWN THAT AWAY ASKED BORIS
lbi-1701-141760-0027 IT IS SOME LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION WHAT THE DEVIL DO I WANT IT FOR
lbi-1701-141760-0028 HE LOOKED INTENTLY AND INQUIRINGLY INTO HIS FRIEND'S EYES EVIDENTLY TRYING IN VAIN TO FIND THE ANSWER TO SOME QUESTION
lbi-1701-141760-0029 WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT COUNT I WAS NOT AT ALL ALARMED BECAUSE I KNEW I WAS RIGHT
lbi-1701-141760-0030 I CAME FORWARD BERG STOOD UP AND SHOWED HOW HE PRESENTED HIMSELF WITH HIS HAND TO HIS CAP AND REALLY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT FOR A FACE TO EXPRESS GREATER RESPECT AND SELF COMPLACENCY THAN HIS DID
lbi-1701-141760-0031 WELL HE STORMED AT ME AS THE SAYING IS STORMED AND STORMED AND STORMED
lbi-1701-141760-0032 IT WAS NOT A MATTER OF LIFE BUT RATHER OF DEATH AS THE SAYING IS
lbi-1701-141760-0033 ALBANIANS AND DEVILS AND TO SIBERIA SAID BERG WITH A SAGACIOUS SMILE
lbi-1701-141760-0034 STILL I REMAINED SILENT AND WHAT DO YOU THINK COUNT
lbi-1701-141760-0035 THE NEXT DAY IT WAS NOT EVEN MENTIONED IN THE ORDERS OF THE DAY
lbi-1701-141760-0036 THAT'S THE WAY COUNT SAID BERG LIGHTING HIS PIPE AND EMITTING RINGS OF SMOKE
lbi-1701-141760-0037 YES THAT WAS FINE SAID ROSTOV SMILING
lbi-1701-141760-0038 ROSTOV WAS A TRUTHFUL YOUNG MAN AND WOULD ON NO ACCOUNT HAVE TOLD A DELIBERATE LIE
lbi-1701-141760-0039 HE BEGAN HIS STORY MEANING TO TELL EVERYTHING JUST AS IT HAPPENED BUT IMPERCEPTIBLY INVOLUNTARILY AND INEVITABLY HE LAPSED INTO FALSEHOOD
lbi-1701-141760-0040 PRINCE ANDREW WHO LIKED TO HELP YOUNG MEN WAS FLATTERED BY BEING ASKED FOR HIS ASSISTANCE AND BEING WELL DISPOSED TOWARD BORIS WHO HAD MANAGED TO PLEASE HIM THE DAY BEFORE HE WISHED TO DO WHAT THE YOUNG MAN WANTED
lbi-1701-141760-0041 IN SPITE OF PRINCE ANDREW'S DISAGREEABLE IRONICAL TONE IN SPITE OF THE CONTEMPT WITH WHICH ROSTOV FROM HIS FIGHTING ARMY POINT OF VIEW REGARDED ALL THESE LITTLE ADJUTANTS ON THE STAFF OF WHOM THE NEWCOMER WAS EVIDENTLY ONE ROSTOV FELT CONFUSED BLUSHED AND BECAME SILENT
lbi-1701-141760-0042 BORIS INQUIRED WHAT NEWS THERE MIGHT BE ON THE STAFF AND WHAT WITHOUT INDISCRETION ONE MIGHT ASK ABOUT OUR PLANS
lbi-1701-141760-0043 WE SHALL PROBABLY ADVANCE REPLIED BOLKONSKI EVIDENTLY RELUCTANT TO SAY MORE IN THE PRESENCE OF A STRANGER
lbi-1701-141760-0044 BERG TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO ASK WITH GREAT POLITENESS WHETHER AS WAS RUMORED THE ALLOWANCE OF FORAGE MONEY TO CAPTAINS OF COMPANIES WOULD BE DOUBLED
lbi-1701-141760-0045 I WAS THERE SAID ROSTOV ANGRILY AS IF INTENDING TO INSULT THE AIDE DE CAMP
lbi-1701-141760-0046 WITH A SLIGHTLY CONTEMPTUOUS SMILE HE SAID YES THERE ARE MANY STORIES NOW TOLD ABOUT THAT AFFAIR
lbi-1701-141760-0047 BUT OUR STORIES ARE THE STORIES OF MEN WHO HAVE BEEN UNDER THE ENEMY'S FIRE
lbi-1701-141760-0048 OUR STORIES HAVE SOME WEIGHT NOT LIKE THE STORIES OF THOSE FELLOWS ON THE STAFF WHO GET REWARDS WITHOUT DOING ANYTHING
lbi-1701-141760-0049 HOWEVER HE ADDED RISING YOU KNOW MY NAME AND WHERE TO FIND ME BUT DON'T FORGET THAT I DO NOT REGARD EITHER MYSELF OR YOU AS HAVING BEEN AT ALL INSULTED AND AS A MAN OLDER THAN YOU MY ADVICE IS TO LET THE MATTER DROP
lbi-1701-141760-0050 EXCLAIMED PRINCE ANDREW AND WITH A BOW TO THEM BOTH HE WENT OUT
lbi-1701-141760-0051 AND HE WAS STILL MORE ANGRY AT HAVING OMITTED TO SAY IT
lbi-1701-141760-0052 HE ORDERED HIS HORSE AT ONCE AND COLDLY TAKING LEAVE OF BORIS RODE HOME
lbi-1701-141760-0053 SHOULD HE GO TO HEADQUARTERS NEXT DAY AND CHALLENGE THAT AFFECTED ADJUTANT OR REALLY LET THE MATTER DROP WAS THE QUESTION THAT WORRIED HIM ALL THE WAY
lbi-2506-11267-0000 I SEE SHOALS OF THEM DEPART NOT PERHAPS WITHOUT AN INNATE LONGING TOO TO QUIT THE ISLAND ALONG WITH THOSE HAPPY SNOBS
lbi-2506-11267-0001 FAREWELL DEAR FRIENDS I SAY YOU LITTLE KNOW THAT THE INDIVIDUAL WHO REGARDS YOU FROM THE BEACH IS YOUR FRIEND AND HISTORIOGRAPHER AND BROTHER
lbi-2506-11267-0002 I WENT TO DAY TO SEE OUR EXCELLENT FRIEND SNOOKS ON BOARD THE QUEEN OF THE FRENCH MANY SCORES OF SNOBS WERE THERE ON THE DECK OF THAT FINE SHIP MARCHING FORTH IN THEIR PRIDE AND BRAVERY
lbi-2506-11267-0003 THEY WILL BE AT OSTEND IN FOUR HOURS THEY WILL INUNDATE THE CONTINENT NEXT WEEK THEY WILL CARRY INTO FAR LANDS THE FAMOUS IMAGE OF THE BRITISH SNOB
lbi-2506-11267-0004 I HAVE SEEN SNOBS IN PINK COATS AND HUNTING BOOTS SCOURING OVER THE CAMPAGNA OF ROME AND HAVE HEARD THEIR OATHS AND THEIR WELL KNOWN SLANG IN THE GALLERIES OF THE VATICAN AND UNDER THE SHADOWY ARCHES OF THE COLOSSEUM
lbi-2506-11267-0005 MY LADY MARCHIONESS COMES ON BOARD LOOKS ROUND WITH THAT HAPPY AIR OF MINGLED TERROR AND IMPERTINENCE WHICH DISTINGUISHES HER LADYSHIP AND RUSHES TO HER CARRIAGE FOR IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT SHE SHOULD MINGLE WITH THE OTHER SNOBS ON DECK
lbi-2506-11267-0006 THERE SHE SITS AND WILL BE ILL IN PRIVATE
lbi-2506-11267-0007 THE STRAWBERRY LEAVES ON HER CHARIOT PANELS ARE ENGRAVED ON HER LADYSHIP'S HEART
lbi-2506-11267-0008 AND DAVIS YOU'D BEST TAKE THE PISTOL CASE INTO THE CABIN
lbi-2506-11267-0009 LOOK AT HONEST NATHAN HOUNDSDITCH AND HIS LADY AND THEIR LITTLE SON
lbi-2506-11267-0010 WHAT A NOBLE AIR OF BLAZING CONTENTMENT ILLUMINATES THE FEATURES OF THOSE SNOBS OF EASTERN RACE
lbi-2506-11267-0011 WHAT A TOILETTE HOUNDSDITCH'S IS
lbi-2506-11267-0012 HE WILL NEVER SPARE HIMSELF ANY CHEAP ENJOYMENT
lbi-2506-11267-0013 I HAVE SAID BEFORE I LIKE TO LOOK AT THE PEOPLES ON THEIR GALA DAYS THEY ARE SO PICTURESQUELY AND OUTRAGEOUSLY SPLENDID AND HAPPY
lbi-2506-11267-0014 YONDER COMES CAPTAIN BULL SPICK AND SPAN TIGHT AND TRIM WHO TRAVELS FOR FOUR OR SIX MONTHS EVERY YEAR OF HIS LIFE WHO DOES NOT COMMIT HIMSELF BY LUXURY OF RAIMENT OR INSOLENCE OF DEMEANOUR BUT I THINK IS AS GREAT A SNOB AS ANY MAN ON BOARD
lbi-2506-11267-0015 BULL PASSES THE SEASON IN LONDON SPONGING FOR DINNERS AND SLEEPING IN A GARRET NEAR HIS CLUB
lbi-2506-11267-0016 SEE HE IS UP TO OLD CARABAS ALREADY I TOLD YOU HE WOULD
lbi-2506-11267-0017 THAT BROAD SHOULDERED BUCK WITH THE GREAT WHISKERS AND THE CLEANED WHITE KID GLOVES IS MISTER PHELIM CLANCY OF POLDOODYSTOWN HE CALLS HIMSELF MISTER DE CLANCY HE ENDEAVOURS TO DISGUISE HIS NATIVE BROGUE WITH THE RICHEST SUPERPOSITION OF ENGLISH AND IF YOU PLAY AT BILLIARDS OR ECARTE WITH HIM THE CHANCES ARE THAT YOU WILL WIN THE FIRST GAME AND HE THE SEVEN OR EIGHT GAMES ENSUING
lbi-2506-11267-0018 THE NEXT PERSON IS BUT HARK
lbi-2506-11278-0000 WHEN A GROSS INSTANCE OF SNOBBISHNESS HAPPENS WHY SHOULD NOT THE INDIGNANT JOURNALIST CALL THE PUBLIC ATTENTION TO THAT DELINQUENCY TOO
lbi-2506-11278-0001 HOW FOR INSTANCE COULD THAT WONDERFUL CASE OF THE EARL OF MANGELWURZEL AND HIS BROTHER BE EXAMINED IN THE SNOBBISH POINT OF VIEW
lbi-2506-11278-0002 ALL WE REQUIRE IS THAT A MAN SHOULD BE RECOMMENDED TO US BY THE EARL OF MANGELWURZELSHIRE
lbi-2506-11278-0003 O YOU PRIDE OF ALL SNOBLAND
lbi-2506-11278-0004 O YOU CRAWLING TRUCKLING SELF CONFESSED LACKEYS AND PARASITES
lbi-2506-11278-0005 IT WAS HER SNOBBISH SENTIMENT THAT MISLED HER AND MADE HER VANITIES A PREY TO THE SWINDLING FORTUNE TELLER
lbi-2506-11278-0006 HOW WOULD YOU ACCOUNT FOR THE PRODIGIOUS BENEVOLENCE EXERCISED TOWARDS THE INTERESTING YOUNG FRENCH LADY
lbi-2506-11278-0007 THE HONEST BOARDING HOUSE PEOPLE WERE AT HER FEET AT ONCE
lbi-2506-11278-0008 GOOD HONEST SIMPLE LORD LOVING CHILDREN OF SNOBLAND
lbi-2506-11278-0009 FINALLY THERE WAS THE CASE OF THE RIGHT HONOURABLE MISTER VERNON AT YORK
lbi-2506-11278-0010 THE RIGHT HONOURABLE WAS THE SON OF A NOBLEMAN AND PRACTISED ON AN OLD LADY
lbi-2506-11278-0011 THEN HE CAST HIS NETS OVER A FAMILY OF FATHER MOTHER AND DAUGHTERS ONE OF WHOM HE PROPOSED TO MARRY
lbi-2506-11278-0012 ONE DAY THE TRAITOR FLED WITH A TEAPOT AND A BASKETFUL OF COLD VICTUALS
lbi-2506-11278-0013 IT WAS THE RIGHT HONOURABLE WHICH BAITED THE HOOK WHICH GORGED ALL THESE GREEDY SIMPLE SNOBS
lbi-2506-11278-0014 WOULD THEY HAVE BEEN TAKEN IN BY A COMMONER
lbi-2506-11278-0015 ALAS AND ALAS WHAT MORTAL MAN THAT SPEAKS THE TRUTH CAN HOPE FOR SUCH A LANDLADY
lbi-2506-11278-0016 AND YET ALL THESE INSTANCES OF FOND AND CREDULOUS SNOBBISHNESS HAVE OCCURRED IN THE SAME WEEK'S PAPER WITH WHO KNOWS HOW MANY SCORE MORE
