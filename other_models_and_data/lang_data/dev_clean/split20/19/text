lbi-7976-110124-0000 LONG AGO THERE LIVED A MERCHANT WHO HAD THREE DAUGHTERS
lbi-7976-110124-0001 EVERY YEAR AT A CERTAIN DAY OF A CERTAIN MONTH HE WENT AWAY TO A DISTANT CITY TO COLLECT MONEY ON AN ACCOUNT
lbi-7976-110124-0002 HOW DO YOU KNOW ASKED THEIR FATHER I AM OLDER AND WISER THAN YOU ARE AND I KNOW THAT THERE ARE MANY EVILS WHICH MIGHT COME UPON YOU
lbi-7976-110124-0003 WHEN IT WAS EVENING HE LED HIS BAND INTO A NEARBY STREET AND IN HIS DISGUISE APPROACHED THE MERCHANT'S HOUSE HE KNOCKED AT THE DOOR
lbi-7976-110124-0004 HAVE PITY UPON A POOR UNFORTUNATE ONE HE CALLED OUT
lbi-7976-110124-0005 LET ME ENTER I PRAY YOU TO PASS THE NIGHT UNDER YOUR ROOF
lbi-7976-110124-0006 IT'S SURELY A TERRIBLE STORM OUTSIDE SAID THE MERCHANT'S ELDEST DAUGHTER AS THE WIND RATTLED THE TILES OF THE ROOF AND THE RAIN BEAT IN TORRENTS AGAINST THE DOORS AND WINDOWS
lbi-7976-110124-0007 HE IS OLD AS WELL AS POOR SHE SAID
lbi-7976-110124-0008 IF WE DECIDE TO SHOW MERCY TO THIS POOR BEGGAR IT IS NOT FOR YOU TO OPPOSE IT
lbi-7976-110124-0009 BUI WE SHOULD NOT FORGET OUR PROMISE TO OUR FATHER CRIED THE YOUNGEST DAUGHTER
lbi-7976-110124-0010 HOWEVER IN SPITE OF ALL SHE COULD SAY THE ELDER SISTERS OPENED THE DOOR AND ADMITTED THE BEGGAR
lbi-7976-110124-0011 IT IS A FEARFUL NIGHT TO SEND AWAY A BEGGAR SAID THE ELDEST SISTER WHILE THEY WERE EATING
lbi-7976-110124-0012 WHILE THEY WERE TALKING THE BEGGAR HAD TAKEN THE APPLES WHICH THE GIRLS WERE TO EAT FOR DESSERT AND HAD SPRINKLED A SLEEPING POWDER OVER THEM
lbi-7976-110124-0013 THE TWO ELDEST ATE THEIR APPLES BUT THE YOUNGEST COULD NOT EAT THAT NIGHT SHE THREW THE APPLE AWAY
lbi-7976-110124-0014 SHE DID NOT STIR AND HE KNEW THAT THE SLEEPING POWDER HAD THOROUGHLY DONE ITS WORK
lbi-7976-110124-0015 THEN SHE HEARD HIM GO DOWN THE STAIRWAY AND UNBOLT THE HEAVY DOORS WHICH LED INTO THE STORE
lbi-7976-110124-0016 IT WAS THE YOUNGEST ONE WHO DECEIVED ME CRIED THE ROBBER CHIEFTAIN
lbi-7976-110124-0017 PERHAPS YOU CAN OUTWIT HER YET CRIED ANOTHER
lbi-7976-110124-0018 THE MERCHANT'S DAUGHTER AT FIRST DID NOT ANSWER BUT AS HE KEPT ON CALLING TO HER SHE FINALLY ASKED HIM WHAT IT WAS THAT HE WANTED
lbi-7976-110124-0019 I PROMISE YOU I WILL DO YOU NO HARM
lbi-7976-110124-0020 YOU SHALL NOT COME INTO MY FATHER'S HOUSE
lbi-7976-110124-0021 PASS THE CHARM OUT TO ME THEN SAID THE ROBBER
lbi-7976-110124-0022 WHEN SHE RETURNED HIS HAND WAS STICKING THROUGH THE HOLE IN THE DOOR
lbi-7976-110124-0023 THE CRIES AND CURSES OF THE ROBBERS FILLED THE AIR
lbi-7976-110124-0024 THEY TRIED IN VAIN TO BREAK DOWN THE GREAT DOORS
lbi-7976-110124-0025 ALL MY WORRIES ABOUT YOU WERE FOOLISH
lbi-7976-110523-0000 HE HAD LITTLE ENOUGH TO BREAK OR BITE AND ONCE WHEN THERE WAS A GREAT FAMINE IN THE LAND HE COULD HARDLY PROCURE EVEN HIS DAILY BREAD AND AS HE LAY THINKING IN HIS BED ONE NIGHT HE SIGHED AND SAID TO HIS WIFE WHAT WILL BECOME OF US
lbi-7976-110523-0001 HOW CAN WE FEED OUR CHILDREN WHEN WE HAVE NO MORE THAN WE CAN EAT OURSELVES
lbi-7976-110523-0002 OH YOU SIMPLETON SAID SHE THEN WE MUST ALL FOUR DIE OF HUNGER YOU HAD BETTER PLANE THE COFFINS FOR US
lbi-7976-110523-0003 BUT SHE LEFT HIM NO PEACE TILL HE CONSENTED SAYING AH BUT I SHALL MISS THE POOR CHILDREN
lbi-7976-110523-0004 AND AS SOON AS THEIR PARENTS HAD GONE TO SLEEP HE GOT UP PUT ON HIS COAT AND UNBARRING THE BACK DOOR WENT OUT
lbi-7976-110523-0005 AH FATHER SAID HANSEL I AM LOOKING AT MY WHITE CAT SITTING UPON THE ROOF OF THE HOUSE AND TRYING TO SAY GOOD BYE
lbi-7976-110523-0006 BUT IN REALITY HANSEL WAS NOT LOOKING AT A CAT BUT EVERY TIME HE STOPPED HE DROPPED A PEBBLE OUT OF HIS POCKET UPON THE PATH
lbi-7976-110523-0007 BUT HER HUSBAND FELT HEAVY AT HEART AND THOUGHT IT WERE BETTER TO SHARE THE LAST CRUST WITH THE CHILDREN
lbi-7976-110523-0008 EARLY IN THE MORNING THE STEPMOTHER CAME AND PULLED THEM OUT OF BED AND GAVE THEM EACH A SLICE OF BREAD WHICH WAS STILL SMALLER THAN THE FORMER PIECE
lbi-7976-110523-0009 WE ARE GOING INTO THE FOREST TO HEW WOOD AND IN THE EVENING WHEN WE ARE READY WE WILL COME AND FETCH YOU AGAIN
lbi-7976-110523-0010 HANSEL THOUGHT THE ROOF TASTED VERY NICE AND SO HE TORE OFF A GREAT PIECE WHILE GRETHEL BROKE A LARGE ROUND PANE OUT OF THE WINDOW AND SAT DOWN QUITE CONTENTEDLY
lbi-7976-110523-0011 COME IN AND STOP WITH ME AND NO HARM SHALL COME TO YOU AND SO SAYING SHE TOOK THEM BOTH BY THE HAND AND LED THEM INTO HER COTTAGE
lbi-7976-110523-0012 THE OLD WOMAN BEHAVED VERY KINDLY TO THEM BUT IN REALITY SHE WAS A WICKED OLD WITCH WHO WAY LAID CHILDREN AND BUILT THE BREADHOUSE IN ORDER TO ENTICE THEM IN BUT AS SOON AS THEY WERE IN HER POWER SHE KILLED THEM COOKED AND ATE THEM AND MADE A GREAT FESTIVAL OF THE DAY
lbi-7976-110523-0013 THEN SHE TOOK UP HANSEL WITH HER ROUGH HAND AND SHUT HIM UP IN A LITTLE CAGE WITH A LATTICE DOOR AND ALTHOUGH HE SCREAMED LOUDLY IT WAS OF NO USE
lbi-7976-110523-0014 GRETHEL BEGAN TO CRY BUT IT WAS ALL USELESS FOR THE OLD WITCH MADE HER DO AS SHE WANTED
lbi-7976-110523-0015 GRETHEL SHE CRIED IN A PASSION GET SOME WATER QUICKLY BE HANSEL FAT OR LEAN THIS MORNING I WILL KILL AND COOK HIM
lbi-7976-110523-0016 DEAR GOOD GOD HELP US NOW SHE PRAYED
lbi-7976-110523-0017 CREEP IN SAID THE WITCH AND SEE IF IT IS HOT ENOUGH AND THEN WE WILL PUT IN THE BREAD BUT SHE INTENDED WHEN GRETHEL GOT IN TO SHUT UP THE OVEN AND LET HER BAKE SO THAT SHE MIGHT EAT HER AS WELL AS HANSEL
lbi-7976-110523-0018 SEE I COULD EVEN GET IN MYSELF
lbi-7976-110523-0019 AND SHE GOT UP AND PUT HER HEAD INTO THE OVEN
lbi-7976-110523-0020 AND NOW AS THERE WAS NOTHING TO FEAR THEY WENT BACK TO THE WITCH'S HOUSE WHERE IN EVERY CORNER WERE CASKETS FULL OF PEARLS AND PRECIOUS STONES
lbi-7976-110523-0021 THEN THEY BEGAN TO RUN AND RUSHING INTO THE HOUSE THEY FELL UPON THEIR FATHER'S NECK
lbi-8297-275154-0000 NOT HAVING HEARD FROM CAPTAIN BENNYDECK FOR SOME LITTLE TIME RANDAL THOUGHT IT DESIRABLE IN SYDNEY'S INTERESTS TO MAKE INQUIRIES AT HIS CLUB
lbi-8297-275154-0001 THE SAILING MASTER ANNOUNCED THAT HE HAD ORDERS TO TAKE THE VESSEL BACK TO HER PORT WITH NO OTHER EXPLANATION THAN THAT THE CRUISE WAS OVER
lbi-8297-275154-0002 THIS ALTERNATIVE IN THE CAPTAIN'S PLANS TERMINATING THE VOYAGE A MONTH EARLIER THAN HIS ARRANGEMENTS HAD CONTEMPLATED PUZZLED RANDAL
lbi-8297-275154-0003 RANDAL WAITED A WHILE IN LONDON ON THE CHANCE THAT BENNYDECK MIGHT PAY HIM A VISIT
lbi-8297-275154-0004 HE IS STAYING AT THIS HOTEL TO TRY THE AIR OF SYDENHAM AND HE FINDS THAT IT AGREES WITH HIM
lbi-8297-275154-0005 HAD HER BEAUTY FASCINATED HIM
lbi-8297-275154-0006 RANDAL WROTE TO ACCEPT THE INVITATION DETERMINING TO PRESENT HIMSELF BEFORE THE APPOINTED HOUR AND TO QUESTION CATHERINE PRIVATELY WITHOUT GIVING HER THE ADVANTAGE OVER HIM OF PREPARING HERSELF FOR THE INTERVIEW
lbi-8297-275154-0007 AFTER MONTHS OF SEPARATION HE RECEIVED A VISIT FROM HERBERT
lbi-8297-275154-0008 YOU DISTRESS ME HERBERT MORE THAN WORDS CAN SAY
lbi-8297-275154-0009 HE DRANK THE WINE GREEDILY
lbi-8297-275154-0010 WHATEVER REVIVING EFFECT IT MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE PRODUCED ON HIM IT MADE NO CHANGE IN THE THREATENING GLOOM OF HIS MANNER
lbi-8297-275154-0011 HE PUT DOWN THE EMPTY GLASS TAKING NO NOTICE OF HIS BROTHER'S QUESTION
lbi-8297-275154-0012 RANDAL HE SAID YOU KNOW WHERE SYDNEY IS
lbi-8297-275154-0013 I WILL DO NEITHER THE ONE NOR THE OTHER
lbi-8297-275154-0014 YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS TO BE USED TO SEEING A PRETTY CREATURE ALWAYS NICELY DRESSED ALWAYS ABOUT THE ROOM THINKING SO MUCH OF YOU AND SO LITTLE OF HERSELF AND THEN TO BE LEFT ALONE AS I AM LEFT OUT IN THE DARK
lbi-8297-275154-0015 I'M ALONE DO YOU HEAR THAT ALONE
lbi-8297-275154-0016 I HAVEN'T COURAGE ENOUGH TO DO IT FOR MYSELF
lbi-8297-275154-0017 OH WHY DID I ENGAGE THAT GOVERNESS
lbi-8297-275154-0018 I'M AFRAID HE SAID
lbi-8297-275154-0019 I TRIED IT YESTERDAY IT SET MY BRAINS ON FIRE I'M FEELING THAT GLASS I TOOK JUST NOW
lbi-8297-275154-0020 HE PAUSED AND PUT HIS HAND TO HIS FEVERED HEAD
lbi-8297-275154-0021 WAS HIS MIND WANDERING INTO SOME OTHER TRAIN OF THOUGHT
lbi-8297-275154-0022 YOU CAN'T DO IT
lbi-8297-275154-0023 LET ME HEAR WHAT IT IS FIRST
lbi-8297-275154-0024 I FEEL FOR YOU HERBERT HE SAID WARMLY
lbi-8297-275154-0025 SHE SHALL HAVE YOUR MESSAGE ALL THAT I CAN DO TO PERSUADE HER SHALL BE DONE
lbi-8297-275154-0026 LET ME REST A LITTLE HE PLEADED IF I'M NOT IN THE WAY
lbi-8297-275154-0027 HE MENTIONED THE NAME OF ONE OF THE OLD SERVANTS AT MOUNT MORVEN WHO HAD ATTACHED HIMSELF TO RANDAL AFTER THE BREAKUP OF THE FAMILY
lbi-8297-275155-0000 ON THE NEXT DAY BUT ONE RANDAL ARRANGED HIS DEPARTURE FOR SYDENHAM SO AS TO ARRIVE AT THE HOTEL AN HOUR BEFORE THE TIME APPOINTED FOR THE DINNER
lbi-8297-275155-0001 THE NEW NUMBER OF A POPULAR WEEKLY JOURNAL HAD THAT DAY BEEN PUBLISHED RANDAL BOUGHT IT
lbi-8297-275155-0002 AFTER READING ONE OR TWO OF THE POLITICAL ARTICLES HE ARRIVED AT THE COLUMNS SPECIALLY DEVOTED TO FASHIONABLE INTELLIGENCE
lbi-8297-275155-0003 RANDAL LOOKED AGAIN AT THE FIRST WORDS IN THE PARAGRAPH
lbi-8297-275155-0004 WITH HIS OWN SUSPICIONS STEADILY CONTRADICTING HIM HE ARRIVED AT THE HOTEL OBSTINATELY BELIEVING THAT THE CHARMING WIDOW WOULD PROVE TO BE A STRANGER
lbi-8297-275155-0005 MISSUS NORMAN AND HER LITTLE DAUGHTER WERE OUT DRIVING WITH A FRIEND AND WERE EXPECTED TO RETURN IN GOOD TIME FOR DINNER
lbi-8297-275155-0006 MISSUS PRESTY WAS AT HOME SHE WAS REPORTED TO BE IN THE GARDEN OF THE HOTEL
lbi-8297-275155-0007 HOW NICE OF YOU TO COME SO SOON SHE BEGAN
lbi-8297-275155-0008 SHE ADDED LOOKING AT HIM SUSPICIOUSLY
lbi-8297-275155-0009 BUT YOU OUGHT TO HAVE KNOWN THAT WE ARE ONLY HALF AN HOUR BEHIND YOU AT SYDENHAM IN THE MATTER OF NEWS
lbi-8297-275155-0010 THE REPORT IS PREMATURE MY GOOD FRIEND
lbi-8297-275155-0011 BUT IF THESE NEWSPAPER PEOPLE WAITED TO FIND OUT WHETHER A REPORT IS TRUE OR FALSE HOW MUCH GOSSIP WOULD SOCIETY GET IN ITS FAVORITE NEWSPAPERS
lbi-8297-275155-0012 YOU ARE TO UNDERSTAND THAT CATHERINE IS A WIDOW
lbi-8297-275155-0013 SIT DOWN SAID MISSUS PRESTY
lbi-8297-275155-0014 YOU SHALL HEAR HOW MY DIVORCED DAUGHTER AND MY POOR LITTLE GRANDCHILD WERE TREATED AT SANDYSEAL AFTER YOU LEFT US
lbi-8297-275155-0015 YOU WOULD HAVE SEEN HER PINING FOR THE COMPANY OF OTHER CHILDREN AND WOULD HAVE HAD NO MERCY ON HER
lbi-8297-275155-0016 HE WAS INTRODUCED TO MISSUS NORMAN AND TO MISSUS NORMAN'S LITTLE GIRL AND WE WERE ALL CHARMED WITH HIM
lbi-8297-275155-0017 WHEN HE AND I HAPPENED TO BE LEFT TOGETHER HE NATURALLY WONDERED AFTER HAVING SEEN THE BEAUTIFUL WIFE WHERE THE LUCKY HUSBAND MIGHT BE
lbi-8297-275155-0018 AND THE CAPTAIN OF COURSE CONCLUDED AFTER HAVING BEEN INTRODUCED TO KITTY THAT MISSUS NORMAN WAS A WIDOW
lbi-8297-275155-0019 WORSE STORIES HAVE BEEN PRINTED I DO ASSURE YOU WORSE STORIES HAVE BEEN PRINTED
lbi-8297-275155-0020 BEFORE I CONSENTED TO ANSWER THE CHILD'S INQUIRIES I CAME TO AN UNDERSTANDING WITH HER MOTHER
lbi-8297-275155-0021 HONESTLY
lbi-8297-275155-0022 AFTER THAT I HAD HER MOTHER'S AUTHORITY FOR TELLING KITTY THAT SHE WOULD NEVER SEE HER FATHER AGAIN
lbi-8297-275155-0023 SHE ASKED DIRECTLY IF HER FATHER WAS DEAD
lbi-8297-275155-0024 THAT WILL DO MISSUS PRESTY YOUR DEFENSE IS THOROUGHLY WORTHY OF YOUR CONDUCT IN ALL OTHER RESPECTS
lbi-8297-275155-0025 RANDAL PASSED THIS OVER WITHOUT NOTICE
lbi-8297-275155-0026 A VERY WISE DECISION SHE REMARKED
lbi-8297-275155-0027 HAVE YOU ANY MESSAGE FOR CAPTAIN BENNYDECK
lbi-8297-275155-0028 NOT AT THE HOTEL JUST NOW
lbi-8297-275155-0029 IT WAS A RELIEF TO RANDAL IN THE PRESENT STATE OF CATHERINE'S RELATIONS TOWARD BENNYDECK TO RETURN TO LONDON WITHOUT HAVING SEEN HIS FRIEND
lbi-8297-275155-0030 GOOD BY DEAR RANDAL
lbi-8297-275155-0031 ARRIVED AT THE STATION RANDAL FOUND THAT HE MUST WAIT FOR THE TRAIN
lbi-8297-275155-0032 WHILE HE WAS WALKING UP AND DOWN THE PLATFORM WITH A MIND DOUBLY DISTRESSED BY ANXIETY ABOUT HIS BROTHER AND ANXIETY ABOUT SYDNEY THE TRAIN FROM LONDON CAME IN
lbi-8297-275156-0000 WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE HE ASKED
lbi-8297-275156-0001 YOU HAVE BEEN TO THE HOTEL HE BURST OUT YOU HAVE SEEN CATHERINE
lbi-8297-275156-0002 WE HAVE BOTH SEEN THE SAME NEWSPAPER OF COURSE AND YOU HAVE BEEN THE FIRST TO CLEAR THE THING UP THAT'S IT ISN'T IT
lbi-8297-275156-0003 NOT SATISFIED WITH GOSSIP IN PRIVATE THE GREEDY PUBLIC APPETITE DEVOURS GOSSIP IN PRINT AND WANTS MORE OF IT THAN ANY ONE EDITOR CAN SUPPLY
lbi-8297-275156-0004 SUPPOSING THE REPORT HAD BEEN TRUE
lbi-8297-275156-0005 IN THE MEANTIME AFTER WHAT MISSUS PRESTY HAD CONFESSED THE CRUEL FALSEHOOD WHICH HAD CHECKED POOR KITTY'S NATURAL INQUIRIES RAISED AN INSUPERABLE OBSTACLE TO A MEETING BETWEEN FATHER AND CHILD
lbi-8297-275156-0006 HE HAD PROMISED TO DO HIS BEST TOWARD PERSUADING CATHERINE TO GRANT SYDNEY AN INTERVIEW
lbi-8297-275156-0007 EVEN THE CHANCE OF SUCCESSFULLY CONFIDING HER TO BENNYDECK'S PROTECTION HAD LOST SOMETHING OF ITS FAIR PROMISE SINCE RANDAL'S VISIT TO SYDENHAM
lbi-8297-275156-0008 BE THE RESULTS HOWEVER WHAT THEY MIGHT RANDAL COULD SEE BUT ONE PLAIN COURSE BEFORE HIM NOW
lbi-8297-275156-0009 CONSIDERATIONS OF DELICACY SEEMED TO FORBID TAKING THIS LIBERTY EVEN WITH AN INTIMATE FRIEND
lbi-8297-275156-0010 WHAT HAPPIER FUTURE COULD AWAIT HER ESPECIALLY IF SHE JUSTIFIED RANDAL'S PAST EXPERIENCE OF ALL THAT WAS CANDID AND TRUTHFUL IN HER CHARACTER THAN TO BECOME HIS FRIEND'S WIFE
lbi-8297-275156-0011 SHALL I SAY THAT SHE MAY EXPECT AN EARLY VISIT FROM YOU WHEN I SEE HER TO MORROW
lbi-8297-275156-0012 HE ADDED SYDNEY'S ADDRESS IN A POSTSCRIPT AND DISPATCHED HIS LETTER THAT EVENING
lbi-8297-275156-0013 BUT IT MIGHT PERHAPS BE EXCUSABLE TO INFER THAT THE MARRIAGE HAD NOT YET BEEN DECIDED ON AND THAT THE CAPTAIN'S PROPOSALS WERE STILL WAITING FOR CATHERINE'S REPLY
