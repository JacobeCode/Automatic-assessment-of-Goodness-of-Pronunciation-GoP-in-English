lbi-4323-13259-0000 THE CHURCH BELLS WERE RINGING AND PEOPLE ON THE AVENUE GOING BY TO SERVICE TURNED CURIOUS INQUIRING LOOKS UP AT THE GREAT HOUSE AND THEN WENT ON TALKING OF THE RECENT EVENTS WHICH HAD SO STRANGELY ENTERED INTO AND MADE HISTORY IN THE CITY
lbi-4323-13259-0001 AND ALL THROUGH HIS IMPASSIONED APPEAL THIS MORNING THERE WAS A NOTE OF SADNESS AND REBUKE AND STERN CONDEMNATION THAT MADE MANY OF THE MEMBERS PALE WITH SELF ACCUSATION OR WITH INWARD ANGER
lbi-4323-13259-0002 RAYMOND HAD VOTED TO CONTINUE FOR ANOTHER YEAR THE SALOON
lbi-4323-13259-0003 THE CHRISTIANS OF RAYMOND STOOD CONDEMNED BY THE RESULT
lbi-4323-13259-0004 FOR THAT HAD BEEN THE FACT IN RAYMOND FOR YEARS THE SALOON RULED
lbi-4323-13259-0005 PRESIDENT MARSH SAT THERE HIS USUAL ERECT HANDSOME FIRM BRIGHT SELF CONFIDENT BEARING ALL GONE HIS HEAD BOWED UPON HIS BREAST THE GREAT TEARS ROLLING DOWN HIS CHEEKS UNMINDFUL OF THE FACT THAT NEVER BEFORE HAD HE SHOWN OUTWARD EMOTION IN A PUBLIC SERVICE
lbi-4323-13259-0006 WHAT IF HE HAD BEGUN TO DO AS JESUS WOULD HAVE DONE LONG AGO
lbi-4323-13259-0007 WHEN HAD THE FIRST CHURCH YIELDED TO SUCH A BAPTISM OF TEARS
lbi-4323-13259-0008 WHAT HAD BECOME OF ITS REGULAR PRECISE CONVENTIONAL ORDER OF SERVICE UNDISTURBED BY ANY VULGAR EMOTION AND UNMOVED BY ANY FOOLISH EXCITEMENT
lbi-4323-13259-0009 THEY HAD BEEN LIVING SO LONG ON THEIR SURFACE FEELINGS THAT THEY HAD ALMOST FORGOTTEN THE DEEPER WELLS OF LIFE
lbi-4323-13259-0010 THE MEETING WAS TENDER IT GLOWED WITH THE SPIRIT'S PRESENCE IT WAS ALIVE WITH STRONG AND LASTING RESOLVE TO BEGIN A WAR ON THE WHISKEY POWER IN RAYMOND THAT WOULD BREAK ITS REIGN FOREVER
lbi-4323-13259-0011 SINCE THE FIRST SUNDAY WHEN THE FIRST COMPANY OF VOLUNTEERS HAD PLEDGED THEMSELVES TO DO AS JESUS WOULD DO THE DIFFERENT MEETINGS HAD BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY DISTINCT IMPULSES OR IMPRESSIONS
lbi-4323-13259-0012 AND ALL THROUGH IT RAN ONE GENERAL CRY FOR DELIVERANCE FROM THE SALOON AND ITS AWFUL CURSE
lbi-4323-13259-0013 GRAY AND HIS WIFE WERE BESIEGED BY INQUIRERS WHO WANTED TO KNOW WHAT LOREEN'S FRIENDS AND ACQUAINTANCES WERE EXPECTED TO DO IN PAYING THEIR LAST RESPECTS TO HER
lbi-4323-13259-0014 GRAY HAD GONE UP TO VIRGINIA'S AND AFTER TALKING IT OVER WITH HER AND MAXWELL THE ARRANGEMENT HAD BEEN MADE
lbi-4323-13259-0015 I AM AND ALWAYS HAVE BEEN OPPOSED TO LARGE PUBLIC FUNERALS SAID GRAY WHOSE COMPLETE WHOLESOME SIMPLICITY OF CHARACTER WAS ONE OF ITS GREAT SOURCES OF STRENGTH BUT THE CRY OF THE POOR CREATURES WHO KNEW LOREEN IS SO EARNEST THAT I DO NOT KNOW HOW TO REFUSE THIS DESIRE TO SEE HER AND PAY HER POOR BODY SOME LAST LITTLE HONOR WHAT DO YOU THINK MISTER MAXWELL
lbi-4323-13259-0016 I WILL BE GUIDED BY YOUR JUDGMENT IN THE MATTER
lbi-4323-13259-0017 I AM SURE THAT WHATEVER YOU AND MISS PAGE THINK BEST WILL BE RIGHT
lbi-4323-13259-0018 UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES I HAVE A GREAT DISTASTE FOR WHAT SEEMS LIKE DISPLAY AT SUCH TIMES BUT THIS SEEMS DIFFERENT
lbi-4323-13259-0019 IT HAPPENED THAT THAT AFTERNOON A SOMEWHAT NOTED NEWSPAPER CORRESPONDENT WAS PASSING THROUGH RAYMOND ON HIS WAY TO AN EDITORIAL CONVENTION IN A NEIGHBORING CITY
lbi-4323-13259-0020 SHE WAS A COMMON STREET DRUNKARD AND YET THE SERVICES AT THE TENT WERE AS IMPRESSIVE AS ANY I EVER WITNESSED IN A METROPOLITAN CHURCH OVER THE MOST DISTINGUISHED CITIZEN
lbi-4323-13259-0021 IT STRUCK ME OF COURSE BEING A STRANGER IN THE PLACE WITH CONSIDERABLE ASTONISHMENT TO HEAR VOICES LIKE THOSE ONE NATURALLY EXPECTS TO HEAR ONLY IN GREAT CHURCHES OR CONCERTS AT SUCH A MEETING AS THIS
lbi-4323-13259-0022 MISTER MAXWELL SPOKE OF THE FACT THAT THE DEAD WOMAN HAD BEEN FULLY PREPARED TO GO BUT HE SPOKE IN A PECULIARLY SENSITIVE MANNER OF THE EFFECT OF THE LIQUOR BUSINESS ON THE LIVES OF MEN AND WOMEN LIKE THIS ONE
lbi-4323-13259-0023 RAYMOND OF COURSE BEING A RAILROAD TOWN AND THE CENTRE OF THE GREAT PACKING INTERESTS FOR THIS REGION IS FULL OF SALOONS
lbi-4323-13259-0024 THEN FOLLOWED WHAT WAS PERHAPS THE QUEER PART OF THIS STRANGE SERVICE
lbi-4323-13259-0025 IT WAS ONE OF THE SIMPLEST AND AT THE SAME TIME ONE OF THE MOST IMPRESSIVE SIGHTS I EVER WITNESSED
lbi-4323-13259-0026 THERE MUST HAVE BEEN A HUNDRED OF THESE WOMEN AND I WAS TOLD MANY OF THEM HAD BEEN CONVERTED AT THE MEETINGS JUST RECENTLY
lbi-4323-18416-0000 THERE WAS NO ANSWER AND AFTER ONE OR TWO INEFFECTUAL ATTEMPTS PHRONSIE TURNED FEARFULLY AWAY
lbi-4323-18416-0001 I'LL TRY AND SHE LAID A QUICK HAND ON THE KNOB
lbi-4323-18416-0002 TWO RED SPOTS BURNED ON HER CHEEKS AND HER PALE BLUE EYES SNAPPED
lbi-4323-18416-0003 OH I'M SURE I HEARD IT RAGING UP AND DOWN
lbi-4323-18416-0004 I DON'T WANT ANY DINNER SAID CHARLOTTE DRAWING BACK
lbi-4323-18416-0005 YES INDEED SAID POLLY CHEERILY JUST AS FINE AS CAN BE
lbi-4323-18416-0006 ASSUREDLY SAID OLD MISTER KING WITH GREAT SATISFACTION IN POLLY'S PLEASURE AND AT HER SUCCESS IN DRAWING CHARLOTTE OUT
lbi-4323-18416-0007 AND AFTER THIS THERE WERE NO MORE QUIET DAYS FOR CHARLOTTE CHATTERTON
lbi-4323-18416-0008 OH BLESS ME IT'S YOU PHRONSIE IN PLEASED SURPRISE
lbi-4323-18416-0009 YES GRANDPAPA SAID PHRONSIE COMING IN AND SHUTTING THE DOOR CAREFULLY I CAME ON PURPOSE TO SEE YOU ALL ALONE
lbi-4323-18416-0010 SO YOU DID DEAR SAID MISTER KING HIGHLY GRATIFIED AND PUSHING AWAY HIS WRITING TABLE HE HELD OUT HIS HAND
lbi-4323-18416-0011 OH NO GRANDPAPA CRIED PHRONSIE IN A RAPTURE I COULD NEVER BE TOO BIG FOR THAT SO SHE PERCHED UP AS OF OLD ON HIS KNEE THEN SHE FOLDED HER HANDS AND LOOKED GRAVELY IN HIS FACE
lbi-4323-18416-0012 WELL MY DEAR WHAT IS IT
lbi-4323-18416-0013 ASKED THE OLD GENTLEMAN PRESENTLY YOU'VE COME TO TELL ME SOMETHING I SUPPOSE
lbi-4323-18416-0014 YES GRANDPAPA I HAVE SAID PHRONSIE DECIDEDLY AND IT IS MOST IMPORTANT TOO GRANDPAPA AND OH I DO WISH IT SO MUCH AND SHE CLASPED HER HANDS TIGHTER AND SIGHED
lbi-4323-18416-0015 WELL THEN PHRONSIE IF YOU WANT IT I SUPPOSE IT MUST BE SAID MISTER KING QUITE AS A MATTER OF COURSE
lbi-4323-18416-0016 OH SHE LEFT YOU EVERYTHING SHE HAD PHRONSIE A COUPLE OF MILLIONS OR SO IT IS WHY
lbi-4323-18416-0017 CHARLOTTE POOR REPEATED THE OLD GENTLEMAN
lbi-4323-18416-0018 WHY NO NOT EXACTLY HER FATHER ISN'T RICH BUT CHARLOTTE I THINK MAY DO VERY WELL ESPECIALLY AS I INTEND TO KEEP HER HERE FOR A WHILE AND THEN I SHALL NEVER LET HER SUFFER PHRONSIE NEVER INDEED
lbi-4323-18416-0019 GRANDPAPA SAID PHRONSIE WASN'T MISSUS CHATTERTON AUNT TO CHARLOTTE
lbi-4323-18416-0020 IF MISSUS CHATTERTON WAS AUNT TO CHARLOTTE PERSISTED PHRONSIE SLOWLY IT SEEMS AS IF CHARLOTTE OUGHT TO HAVE SOME OF THE MONEY IT REALLY DOES GRANDPAPA
lbi-4323-18416-0021 MAYBE SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN WITH A SHORT LAUGH AND I SHOULDN'T WONDER IF COUSIN EUNICE WAS SORRY OVER A FEW OTHER THINGS TOO PHRONSIE
lbi-4323-18416-0022 WOULDN'T IT MAKE HER VERY GLAD IF I GAVE CHARLOTTE SOME OF THE MONEY
lbi-4323-18416-0023 FOR ANSWER MISTER KING SET HER DOWN HASTILY ON THE FLOOR AND TOOK TWO OR THREE TURNS UP AND DOWN THE ROOM
lbi-4323-18416-0024 OH I DO SO WISH I MIGHT SHE SAID THERE'S SO MUCH FOR A LITTLE GIRL LIKE ME
lbi-4323-18416-0025 IT WOULD BE SO NICE TO HAVE CHARLOTTE HAVE SOME WITH ME STILL NO ANSWER
lbi-4323-18416-0026 I WAS WRITING A NOTE TO MISSUS FARGO SAID PHRONSIE PUTTING UP HER LIPS FOR A KISS
lbi-4323-18416-0027 SURE AS I CAN BE PHRONSIE SAID OLD MISTER KING SMILING GOOD BY DEAR
lbi-4323-18416-0028 THERE THERE MY SISTER'S BOY SHALL NEVER SAY THAT BUT COME IN COME IN
lbi-4323-18416-0029 NOT TO BE UNGRACIOUS THE YOUNG MAN THREW HIMSELF INTO A CHAIR
lbi-4323-18416-0030 OH HANG IT UNCLE WHY CAN'T YOU LET ME ALONE
lbi-4323-18416-0031 WHICH IS A WONDER INTERPOLATED PICKERING
lbi-4323-18416-0032 I KNOW YOU DID UNCLE SAID PICKERING YOU'VE DONE EVERYTHING THAT'S GOOD
lbi-4323-18416-0033 FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE PICKERING CRIED HIS UNCLE DARTING IN FRONT OF THE CHAIR AND ITS RESTLESS OCCUPANT DON'T SAY THAT AGAIN
lbi-4323-18416-0034 I'VE BEEN A LAZY DOG ALL MY LIFE AND A GOOD FOR NAUGHT BUT I HOPE I'VE NOT SUNK TO THAT
lbi-4323-55228-0000 THE NEXT MOMENT HE FELL BACK IN AMAZEMENT BEFORE THE IMPETUOUS RUSH OF A STARRY EYED FLUSHED CHEEKED YOUNG WOMAN WHO DEMANDED
lbi-4323-55228-0001 WHERE IS HE PETE MISS BILLY GASPED THE OLD MAN
lbi-4323-55228-0002 AUNT HANNAH'S CHEEKS TOO WERE FLUSHED AND HER EYES STARRY BUT WITH DISMAY AND ANGER THE LAST BECAUSE SHE DID NOT LIKE THE WAY PETE HAD SAID MISS BILLY'S NAME
lbi-4323-55228-0003 IT WAS ONE MATTER FOR HER TO OBJECT TO THIS THING BILLY WAS DOING BUT QUITE ANOTHER FOR PETE TO DO IT OF COURSE IT'S SHE
lbi-4323-55228-0004 RETORTED AUNT HANNAH TESTILY AS IF YOU YOURSELF DIDN'T BRING HER HERE WITH YOUR CRAZY MESSAGES AT THIS TIME OF NIGHT PETE WHERE IS HE
lbi-4323-55228-0005 INTERPOSED BILLY TELL MISTER BERTRAM I AM HERE OR WAIT I'LL GO RIGHT IN AND SURPRISE HIM
lbi-4323-55228-0006 PETE HAD RECOVERED HIMSELF BY NOW BUT HE DID NOT EVEN GLANCE TOWARD AUNT HANNAH
lbi-4323-55228-0007 MISS BILLY MISS BILLY YOU'RE AN ANGEL STRAIGHT FROM HEAVEN YOU ARE YOU ARE OH I'M SO GLAD YOU CAME
lbi-4323-55228-0008 IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT NOW ALL RIGHT HE'S IN THE DEN MISS BILLY
lbi-4323-55228-0009 BILLY TURNED EAGERLY BUT BEFORE SHE COULD TAKE SO MUCH AS ONE STEP TOWARD THE DOOR AT THE END OF THE HALL AUNT HANNAH'S INDIGNANT VOICE ARRESTED HER BILLY STOP
lbi-4323-55228-0010 PETE GO TELL YOUR MASTER THAT WE ARE HERE AND ASK IF HE WILL RECEIVE US PETE'S LIPS TWITCHED
lbi-4323-55228-0011 BUT HIS FACE WAS PRETERNATURALLY GRAVE WHEN HE SPOKE
lbi-4323-55228-0012 A FLYING FIGURE BRUSHED BY HIM AND FELL ON ITS KNEES BY THE COUCH WITH A LOW CRY BERTRAM'S EYES FLEW OPEN
lbi-4323-55228-0013 DONG LING FOUND HIM THERE A MINUTE LATER POLISHING A SILVER TEASPOON WITH A FRINGED NAPKIN THAT HAD BEEN SPREAD OVER BERTRAM'S TRAY
lbi-4323-55228-0014 IN THE HALL ABOVE AUNT HANNAH WAS CRYING INTO WILLIAM'S GRAY LINEN DUSTER THAT HUNG ON THE HALL RACK AUNT HANNAH'S HANDKERCHIEF WAS ON THE FLOOR BACK AT HILLSIDE
lbi-4323-55228-0015 THEN VERY GRADUALLY IT DAWNED OVER THEM THAT THERE WAS AFTER ALL SOMETHING STRANGE AND UNEXPLAINED IN IT ALL
lbi-4323-55228-0016 AS IF TO MAKE SURE THAT SHE WAS HERE LIKE THIS HE DREW HER EVEN CLOSER BERTRAM WAS SO THANKFUL THAT HE DID HAVE ONE ARM THAT WAS USABLE
lbi-4323-55228-0017 WHY OF OF COURSE STAMMERED BILLY I COULDN'T HELP THINKING THAT MAYBE YOU HAD FOUND OUT YOU DIDN'T WANT ME
lbi-4323-55228-0018 DEMANDED BERTRAM ANGRY AND MYSTIFIED
lbi-4323-55228-0019 AS FOR MY NOT PAINTING AGAIN YOU DIDN'T UNDERSTAND PETE DEARIE
lbi-4323-55228-0020 SHE PULLED HERSELF HALF AWAY FROM BERTRAM'S ENCIRCLING ARM
lbi-4323-55228-0021 BILLY DREW A QUIVERING SIGH
lbi-4323-55228-0022 GOOD HEAVENS IS KATE IN THIS TOO BERTRAM'S VOICE WAS SAVAGE NOW
lbi-4323-55228-0023 WELL SHE WROTE A LETTER
lbi-4323-55228-0024 BILLY LAUGHED GAYLY BUT SHE SHIFTED HER POSITION AND DID NOT MEET HER LOVER'S EYES
lbi-4323-55228-0025 AND YOU NEVER DID THINK FOR A MINUTE BILLY THAT YOU CARED FOR HIM
lbi-4323-55228-0026 HE HAD NOT BEEN SLOW TO MARK THAT SWIFT LOWERING OF HER EYELIDS
lbi-4323-55228-0027 BILLY WAS SO GLAD BERTRAM HAD TURNED THE QUESTION ON HER LOVE INSTEAD OF ARKWRIGHT'S
lbi-4323-55228-0028 AFTER A MINUTE BILLY STIRRED AND SIGHED HAPPILY
lbi-4323-55228-0029 YOU SEE I WASN'T IN LOVE WITH MISTER ARKWRIGHT
lbi-4323-55228-0030 AND AND YOU DIDN'T CARE SPECIALLY FOR FOR MISS WINTHROP
lbi-4323-55228-0031 BILLY PUT A SOFT FINGER ON HIS LIPS
lbi-4323-55228-0032 BERTRAM KISSED THE FINGER AND SUBSIDED HUMPH HE COMMENTED
lbi-4323-55228-0033 WELL WHAT IS THAT IS THAT KATE TOO DEMANDED BERTRAM GRIMLY
lbi-4323-55228-0034 THERE WAS ANOTHER SILENCE THEN SUDDENLY BERTRAM STIRRED
lbi-4323-55228-0035 BILLY I'M GOING TO MARRY YOU TO MORROW HE ANNOUNCED DECISIVELY
lbi-4323-55228-0036 I DON'T KNOW AS I CAN TRUST YOU OUT OF MY SIGHT TILL THEN YOU'LL READ SOMETHING OR HEAR SOMETHING OR GET A LETTER FROM KATE AFTER BREAKFAST TO MORROW MORNING THAT WILL SET YOU SAVING ME AGAIN AND I DON'T WANT TO BE SAVED THAT WAY
lbi-4323-55228-0037 I'M GOING TO MARRY YOU TO MORROW I'LL GET HE STOPPED SHORT WITH A SUDDEN FROWN CONFOUND THAT LAW I FORGOT
lbi-4323-55228-0038 FIVE DAYS INDEED SIR
lbi-4323-55228-0039 I WONDER IF YOU THINK I CAN GET READY TO BE MARRIED IN FIVE DAYS
lbi-4323-55228-0040 DON'T WANT YOU TO GET READY RETORTED BERTRAM PROMPTLY I SAW MARIE GET READY AND I HAD ALL I WANTED OF IT
lbi-4323-55228-0041 IF YOU REALLY MUST HAVE ALL THOSE MILES OF TABLECLOTHS AND NAPKINS AND DOILIES AND LACE RUFFLINGS WE'LL DO IT AFTERWARDS NOT BEFORE BUT
lbi-4323-55228-0042 BESIDES I NEED YOU TO TAKE CARE OF ME CUT IN BERTRAM CRAFTILY
lbi-4323-55228-0043 THE TENDER GLOW ON BILLY'S FACE TOLD ITS OWN STORY AND BERTRAM'S EAGER EYES WERE NOT SLOW TO READ IT
lbi-4323-55228-0044 SWEETHEART SEE HERE DEAR HE CRIED SOFTLY TIGHTENING HIS GOOD LEFT ARM
lbi-4323-55228-0045 BILLY MY DEAR
lbi-4323-55228-0046 IT WAS AUNT HANNAH'S PLAINTIVE VOICE AT THE DOORWAY A LITTLE LATER
lbi-4323-55228-0047 WE MUST GO HOME AND WILLIAM IS HERE TOO AND WANTS TO SEE YOU
lbi-4323-55228-0048 YOU MEAN IT'LL BE BEFORE OCTOBER
lbi-4323-55228-0049 AUNT HANNAH GLANCED FROM ONE TO THE OTHER UNCERTAINLY
lbi-4323-55228-0050 YES NODDED BILLY DEMURELY
lbi-4323-55228-0051 YES I KNOW THAT IS A GOOD WHILE CUT IN BERTRAM AIRILY
lbi-4323-55228-0052 WE WANTED IT TO MORROW BUT WE HAD TO WAIT ON ACCOUNT OF THE NEW LICENSE LAW
lbi-4515-11057-0000 YET SO STRONG WAS THE EFFECT UPON HIM OF CONTEMPLATING A LARGE FORTUNE THAT IN DESPITE OF REASON AND DESIRE HE LIVED IN EAGER EXPECTATION OF THE WORD WHICH SHOULD MAKE HIM RICH
lbi-4515-11057-0001 A PART OF THAT IMPRESSION WAS DUE TO THE ENGAGEMENT WHICH HE MUST NOW FULFIL
lbi-4515-11057-0002 TO SHUFFLE OUT OF THIS DUTY WOULD MAKE HIM TOO IGNOBLE EVEN IN HIS OWN EYES
lbi-4515-11057-0003 BECAUSE IN HIS SALAD DAYS HE DALLIED WITH A GIRL WHO HAD INDEED MANY CHARMS STEP BY STEP HE HAD COME TO THE NECESSITY OF SACRIFICING HIS PROSPECTS TO THAT RAW ATTACHMENT
lbi-4515-11057-0004 UNABLE TO THINK OF WORK HE LEFT THE HOUSE AND WANDERED GLOOMILY ABOUT REGENT'S PARK
lbi-4515-11057-0005 HE FELT HIMSELF ILL USED BY DESTINY AND THEREFORE BY MARIAN WHO WAS FATE'S INSTRUMENT
lbi-4515-11057-0006 HE WROTE TO MARIAN
lbi-4515-11057-0007 WILL YOU LET ME HEAR OR COME AND SEE ME
lbi-4515-11057-0008 I SCARCELY THOUGHT OF BIFFEN AS LIKELY TO KILL HIMSELF
lbi-4515-11057-0009 BUT WHY THE DEUCE DID HE GO ALL THE WAY OUT THERE
lbi-4515-11057-0010 I HOPED YOU WOULD BRING ME SOME NEWS
lbi-4515-11057-0011 POVERTY I CAN ONLY SUPPOSE
lbi-4515-11057-0012 BUT I WILL SEE WHELPDALE I HADN'T COME ACROSS BIFFEN FOR A LONG TIME
lbi-4515-11057-0013 WAS HE STILL SO VERY POOR
lbi-4515-11057-0014 ASKED AMY COMPASSIONATELY
lbi-4515-11057-0015 I'M AFRAID SO HIS BOOK FAILED UTTERLY
lbi-4515-11057-0016 OH IF I HAD IMAGINED HIM STILL IN SUCH DISTRESS SURELY I MIGHT HAVE DONE SOMETHING TO HELP HIM
lbi-4515-11057-0017 PERCHANCE HIS DEATH WAS IN PART ATTRIBUTABLE TO THAT HOPELESS LOVE
lbi-4515-11057-0018 HE SENT ME A COPY OF HIS NOVEL SHE SAID AND I SAW HIM ONCE OR TWICE AFTER THAT
lbi-4515-11057-0019 HAVING THIS SUBJECT TO CONVERSE UPON PUT THE TWO MORE QUICKLY AT EASE THAN COULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN THE CASE
lbi-4515-11057-0020 AMY MIGHT TAKE A FOREMOST PLACE AMONG BRILLIANT WOMEN
lbi-4515-11057-0021 ESPECIALLY NOW THAT HER FATHER IS THREATENED WITH BLINDNESS
lbi-4515-11057-0022 IS IT SO SERIOUS
lbi-4515-11057-0023 EVEN IF MISTER YULE RECOVERS HIS SIGHT IT IS NOT AT ALL LIKELY THAT HE WILL BE ABLE TO WORK AS BEFORE
lbi-4515-11057-0024 OUR DIFFICULTIES ARE SO GRAVE THAT
lbi-4515-11057-0025 HE PAUSED AND LET HIS HAND FAIL DESPONDENTLY
lbi-4515-11057-0026 I HAVE A GOOD DEAL OF WILL YOU REMEMBER AND WHAT I HAVE SET MY MIND UPON NO DOUBT I SHALL SOME DAY ACHIEVE
lbi-4515-11057-0027 THERE WAS SILENCE
lbi-4515-11057-0028 THE LAST THREE YEARS HE CONTINUED HAVE MADE NO SLIGHT DIFFERENCE IN MY POSITION
lbi-4515-11057-0029 RECALL WHERE I STOOD WHEN YOU FIRST KNEW ME
lbi-4515-11057-0030 JUST NOW I AM IN NEED OF A LITTLE ENCOURAGEMENT
lbi-4515-11057-0031 YOU DON'T NOTICE ANY FALLING OFF IN MY WORK RECENTLY
lbi-4515-11057-0032 DO YOU SEE MY THINGS IN THE CURRENT AND SO ON GENERALLY
lbi-4515-11057-0033 SOMETIMES I BELIEVE I HAVE DETECTED YOU WHEN THERE WAS NO SIGNATURE
lbi-4515-11057-0034 HER STORY IN THAT GIRLS PAPER HAS ATTRACTED ATTENTION
lbi-4515-11057-0035 AND I COULD SO EASILY PUT HER AT REST BY RENOUNCING ALL CLAIM UPON HER
lbi-4515-11057-0036 I SURMISE THAT THAT YOU YOURSELF WOULD ALSO BE PUT AT REST BY SUCH A DECISION
lbi-4515-11057-0037 DON'T LOOK AT ME WITH THAT IRONICAL SMILE HE PLEADED
lbi-4515-11057-0038 I COULDN'T GO ABOUT DECLARING THAT I WAS HEARTBROKEN IN ANY EVENT I MUST BE CONTENT FOR PEOPLE TO JUDGE ME ACCORDING TO THEIR DISPOSITION AND JUDGMENTS ARE PRETTY SURE TO BE UNFAVOURABLE WHAT CAN I DO
lbi-4515-11057-0039 THE CASE IS TOO DELICATE I FEAR FOR MY ADVICE
lbi-4515-11057-0040 WELL I'LL GO BACK TO MY SCRIBBLING
lbi-4515-11057-0041 AGAIN JASPER HELD THE WHITE SOFT HAND FOR A SUPERFLUOUS MOMENT
lbi-4515-11057-0042 YET FOR SUCH FEELINGS HE REPROACHED HIMSELF AND THE REPROACH MADE HIM ANGRY
lbi-4515-11057-0043 MARIAN COULD NOT MISTAKE THE AIR OF RESTLESS TROUBLE ON HER COMPANION'S SMOOTH COUNTENANCE
lbi-4515-11057-0044 SHE HAD DIVINED THAT THERE WAS SOME GRAVE REASON FOR THIS SUMMONS AND THE PANTING WITH WHICH SHE HAD APPROACHED WAS HALF CAUSED BY THE ANXIOUS BEATS OF HER HEART
lbi-4515-11057-0045 HE BEGAN ABRUPTLY
lbi-4515-11057-0046 HE GAVE HER SUCH DETAILS AS HE HAD OBTAINED THEN ADDED
lbi-4515-11057-0047 THERE ARE TWO OF MY COMPANIONS FALLEN IN THE BATTLE
lbi-4515-11057-0048 I OUGHT TO THINK MYSELF A LUCKY FELLOW MARIAN WHAT
lbi-4515-11057-0049 YOU ARE BETTER FITTED TO FIGHT YOUR WAY JASPER
lbi-4515-11057-0050 MORE OF A BRUTE YOU MEAN
lbi-4515-11057-0051 YOU KNOW VERY WELL I DON'T
lbi-4515-11057-0052 I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND ABOUT OUR AFFAIRS HE WENT ON PRESENTLY
lbi-4515-11057-0053 YES
lbi-4515-11057-0054 WILL YOU MARRY ME AND LET US TAKE OUR CHANCE
lbi-4515-11057-0055 YOU FEEL YOURSELF INDISPENSABLE TO YOUR FATHER AT PRESENT
lbi-4515-11057-0056 I SHOULD BE SO AFRAID OF THE EFFECT UPON HIS HEALTH JASPER
lbi-4515-11057-0057 SHE PAUSED AND LOOKED UP AT HIM TOUCHINGLY
lbi-4515-11057-0058 DEAR I CAN'T FEEL IT WOULD BE MY DUTY TO RENOUNCE YOU BECAUSE MY FATHER HAD BECOME BLIND
lbi-4515-11057-0059 HAS ONE THING OCCURRED TO YOU
lbi-4515-11057-0060 WILL HE CONSENT TO RECEIVE AN ALLOWANCE FROM A PERSON WHOSE NAME IS MISSUS MILVAIN
lbi-4515-11057-0061 AND IF HE OBSTINATELY REFUSES WHAT THEN WHAT IS BEFORE HIM
lbi-4515-11057-0062 SHE LISTENED ANXIOUSLY AND REFLECTED
lbi-4515-11057-0063 AS I HAVE SAID THERE IS THE VERY SERIOUS DOUBT WHETHER YOUR FATHER WOULD ACCEPT MONEY FROM YOU WHEN YOU ARE MY WIFE
lbi-4515-11057-0064 IT ISN'T YOUR FAULT MARIAN AND WELL THEN THERE'S ONLY ONE THING TO DO
lbi-4515-11057-0065 EXCEPT JASPER THAT IF FATHER IS HELPLESS I MUST FIND MEANS OF ASSURING HIS SUPPORT
lbi-4515-11057-0066 DO YOU THINK THEM INSURMOUNTABLE
lbi-4515-11057-0067 THAT IS JUST WHAT I HAVE DECIDED IS IMPOSSIBLE MARIAN YOU SHALL HAVE THE PLAIN TRUTH
lbi-4515-11057-0068 I DON'T TRUST MYSELF
lbi-4515-11057-0069 BUT SHALL YOU FACE THEM WILLINGLY
lbi-4515-11057-0070 PUT UP YOUR UMBRELLA MARIAN
lbi-4515-11057-0071 WHAT DO I CARE FOR A DROP OF RAIN SHE EXCLAIMED WITH PASSIONATE SADNESS WHEN ALL MY LIFE IS AT STAKE HOW AM I TO UNDERSTAND YOU
lbi-4515-11057-0072 EVERY WORD YOU SPEAK SEEMS INTENDED TO DISHEARTEN ME
lbi-4515-11057-0073 WHY NEED YOU CONCEAL IT IF THAT IS THE TRUTH
lbi-4515-11057-0074 IS THAT WHAT YOU MEAN BY SAYING YOU DISTRUST YOURSELF
lbi-4515-11057-0075 WE MUST SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN MARIAN
lbi-4515-11057-0076 HOW AM I TO LIVE AN HOUR IN SUCH UNCERTAINTY AS THIS
lbi-4515-11057-0077 I DO WISH IT
lbi-4515-11057-0078 HER EMOTION HAD AN EFFECT UPON HIM AND HIS VOICE TREMBLED
lbi-4515-11057-0079 THERE IS NO NATURAL LAW THAT A CHILD SHOULD SURRENDER EVERYTHING FOR HER PARENTS
lbi-4515-11057-0080 YOU KNOW SO MUCH MORE OF THE WORLD THAN I DO CAN'T YOU ADVISE ME
lbi-4515-11057-0081 IS THERE NO WAY OF PROVIDING FOR MY FATHER
lbi-4515-11057-0082 GOOD GOD THIS IS FRIGHTFUL MARIAN I CAN'T STAND IT
lbi-4515-11057-0083 I WILL BE FAITHFUL TO YOU
lbi-4515-11057-0084 HE HAD MADE A PRETENCE OF HOLDING HIS UMBRELLA OVER HER BUT MARIAN TURNED AWAY AND WALKED TO A LITTLE DISTANCE AND STOOD BENEATH THE SHELTER OF A GREAT TREE HER FACE AVERTED FROM HIM
lbi-4515-11057-0085 MOVING TO FOLLOW HE SAW THAT HER FRAME WAS SHAKEN BY SOUNDLESS SOBBING
lbi-4515-11057-0086 IN WHAT CAN THERE BE MORE SELFISHNESS
lbi-4515-11057-0087 BUT I COULDN'T SAY A WORD THAT WOULD SEEM TO INVITE SUCH MISERY AS THIS
lbi-4515-11057-0088 YOU DON'T LOVE ME JASPER AND THAT'S AN END OF EVERYTHING
lbi-4515-11057-0089 HAPPINESS OR MISERY COME TO US BY FATE
lbi-4515-11057-0090 IS IT IN MY POWER TO MAKE YOU HAPPY
lbi-4515-11057-0091 BUT IF YOU HAD SAID YOU LOVED ME BEFORE THAT I SHOULD HAVE IT ALWAYS TO REMEMBER
lbi-4515-11057-0092 IF I BELIEVE ANYTHING I BELIEVE THAT I DID LOVE YOU
lbi-4515-11057-0093 WHAT CAN YOU SAY TO ME MORE THAN YOU HAVE SAID NOW
lbi-4515-11057-0094 REMEMBER ME AS A MAN WHO DISREGARDED PRICELESS LOVE SUCH AS YOURS TO GO AND MAKE HIMSELF A PROUD POSITION AMONG FOOLS AND KNAVES INDEED THAT'S WHAT IT COMES TO
lbi-4515-11057-0095 SOON ENOUGH YOU WOULD THOROUGHLY DESPISE ME AND THOUGH I SHOULD KNOW IT WAS MERITED MY PERVERSE PRIDE WOULD REVOLT AGAINST IT
lbi-4515-11057-0096 WHAT CAN BE SIMPLER THAN THE TRUTH
lbi-4515-11057-0097 IT IS A THING THAT HAPPENS EVERY DAY EITHER IN MAN OR WOMAN AND ALL THAT HONOUR DEMANDS IS THE COURAGE TO CONFESS THE TRUTH
lbi-4515-11057-0098 MARIAN WILL YOU DO THIS WILL YOU LET OUR ENGAGEMENT LAST FOR ANOTHER SIX MONTHS BUT WITHOUT OUR MEETING DURING THAT TIME
lbi-4515-11057-0099 THAT SEEMS TO ME CHILDISH
lbi-4515-11057-0100 THE RAIN FELL UNCEASINGLY AND WITH IT BEGAN TO MINGLE AN AUTUMNAL MIST
lbi-4515-11057-0101 JASPER DELAYED A MOMENT THEN ASKED CALMLY
lbi-4515-11057-0102 ARE YOU GOING TO THE MUSEUM YES
lbi-4515-11057-0103 GO HOME AGAIN FOR THIS MORNING MARIAN YOU CAN'T WORK
lbi-4515-11057-0104 I MUST AND I HAVE NO TIME TO LOSE
lbi-4515-11057-0105 GOOD BYE SHE GAVE HIM HER HAND
lbi-4515-11057-0106 THEY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER FOR AN INSTANT THEN MARIAN LEFT THE SHELTER OF THE TREE OPENED HER UMBRELLA AND WALKED QUICKLY AWAY
lbi-4515-11057-0107 JASPER DID NOT WATCH HER HE HAD THE FACE OF A MAN WHO IS SUFFERING A SEVERE HUMILIATION
lbi-4515-11057-0108 HIS SISTER SAID VERY LITTLE FOR SHE RECOGNISED GENUINE SUFFERING IN HIS TONES AND ASPECT
lbi-4515-11057-0109 A FEW WEEKS AGO HE ACTUALLY PROPOSED TO A WOMAN FOR WHOM HE DOES NOT PRETEND TO HAVE THE SLIGHTEST AFFECTION BUT WHO IS VERY RICH AND WHO SEEMED LIKELY TO BE FOOLISH ENOUGH TO MARRY HIM
lbi-4515-11057-0110 YESTERDAY MORNING HE RECEIVED HER FINAL ANSWER A REFUSAL
lbi-4515-11057-0111 YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THOUGH SURELY YOU NEED NO FRESH PROOF HOW UTTERLY UNWORTHY HE IS OF YOU
lbi-4515-11057-0112 YOU ARE THE ONLY FRIEND I HAVE OF MY OWN SEX AND I COULD NOT BEAR TO LOSE YOU
lbi-4515-11057-0113 SEVERAL DAYS PASSED BEFORE THERE CAME A REPLY
lbi-4515-11057-0114 I MUST ONLY ASK THAT YOU WILL WRITE TO ME WITHOUT THE LEAST REFERENCE TO THESE TROUBLES TELL ME ALWAYS ABOUT YOURSELF AND BE SURE THAT YOU CANNOT TELL ME TOO MUCH
lbi-4570-102353-0000 WE HAD THEN BUT LITTLE OF THAT MINUTE AND ACCURATE KNOWLEDGE OF THE INTERIOR OF THE CONTINENT WHICH WAS REQUISITE FOR A DETERMINATION OF THE PROBLEM
lbi-4570-102353-0001 SEVERAL DIFFERENT PARTIES WERE THEREFORE ORGANIZED TO EXAMINE THE VARIOUS ROUTES SUPPOSED TO BE PRACTICABLE WITHIN THE NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN LIMITS OF THE UNITED STATES
lbi-4570-102353-0002 THE ONLY DISCRIMINATION MADE WAS IN THE MORE PROMPT AND THOROUGH EQUIPMENT OF THE PARTIES FOR THE EXTREME NORTHERN LINE AND THIS WAS ONLY BECAUSE THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE MOST DIFFICULT OF EXECUTION OF ALL THE SURVEYS
lbi-4570-102353-0003 INQUIRIES WERE MADE WITH REGARD TO GUNPOWDER WHICH SUBSEQUENTLY LED TO THE USE OF A COARSER GRAIN FOR ARTILLERY
lbi-4570-102353-0004 THE OFFICERS OF THESE REGIMENTS WERE CHOSEN PARTLY BY SELECTION FROM THOSE ALREADY IN SERVICE IN THE REGULAR ARMY AND PARTLY BY APPOINTMENT FROM CIVIL LIFE
lbi-4570-102353-0005 UNDER INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE PRESIDENT THE LIST WAS THEREFORE REVISED AND MODIFIED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS NEW ELEMENT OF GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION
lbi-4570-102353-0006 AFTER SOME FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE QUESTION THE VISITORS WITHDREW DISSATISFIED WITH THE RESULT OF THE INTERVIEW
lbi-4570-102353-0007 THE QUARTERMASTER GENERAL ON HEARING OF THIS CONVERSATION HASTENED TO INFORM ME THAT IT WAS ALL A MISTAKE THAT THE APPOINTEE TO THE OFFICE HAD BEEN CONFOUNDED WITH HIS FATHER WHO WAS A WELL KNOWN WHIG BUT THAT HE THE SON WAS A DEMOCRAT
lbi-4570-102353-0008 I ASSURED THE GENERAL THAT THIS WAS ALTOGETHER IMMATERIAL ADDING THAT IT WAS A VERY PRETTY QUARREL AS IT STOOD AND THAT I HAD NO DESIRE TO EFFECT A SETTLEMENT OF IT ON ANY INFERIOR ISSUE
lbi-4570-14911-0000 NEVERTHELESS IN GENERAL APPEARANCE THE HARRIER AND THE FOXHOUND ARE VERY MUCH ALIKE THE ONE OBVIOUS DISTINCTION BEING THAT OF SIZE
lbi-4570-14911-0001 IF YOU WANT TO HUNT YOUR HARRIERS ON FOOT SIXTEEN INCHES IS QUITE BIG ENOUGH ALMOST TOO BIG TO RUN WITH BUT IF YOU ARE RIDING TO THEM TWENTY INCHES IS A USEFUL HEIGHT OR EVEN NINETEEN INCHES
lbi-4570-14911-0002 IT IS USELESS TO LAY DOWN ANY HARD AND FAST RULE AS TO COLOUR IT IS SO MUCH A MATTER OF INDIVIDUAL TASTE
lbi-4570-14911-0003 BUT PUPPIES ARE USUALLY SENT OUT TO WALK AND MAY EASILY BE PROCURED TO BE KEPT AND REARED UNTIL THEY ARE OLD ENOUGH TO BE ENTERED TO THEIR WORK
lbi-4570-14911-0004 HE IS OF COURSE FINER BUT WITH THE LENGTH OF NECK SO PERFECT IN THE BIGGER HOUND THE LITTLE SHOULDERS OF THE SAME PATTERN AND THE TYPICAL QUARTERS AND SECOND THIGHS
lbi-4570-14911-0005 AND WHEN HE IS FAIRLY ON A LINE OF COURSE HE STICKS TO IT AS THE SAYING IS LIKE A BEAGLE
lbi-4570-14911-0006 IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THEREFORE THAT THE BEAGLE WAS CROSSED WITH THE WELSH SOUTHERN OR OTTERHOUND TO GET MORE SIZE AND POWER AS THERE CERTAINLY WAS A WELSH ROUGH COATED BEAGLE OF GOOD EIGHTEEN INCHES AND AN ALMOST IDENTICAL CONTEMPORARY THAT WAS CALLED THE ESSEX BEAGLE
lbi-4570-14911-0007 THAT A GREAT MANY OF THE TRUE ORDER WERE BRED BECAME VERY MANIFEST AS SOON AS THE HARRIER AND BEAGLE ASSOCIATION WAS FORMED AND MORE PARTICULARLY WHEN A SECTION OF THE PETERBOROUGH HOUND SHOW WAS RESERVED FOR THEM
lbi-4570-14911-0008 THEN THEY SEEMED TO SPRING FROM EVERY PART OF THE COUNTRY
lbi-4570-14911-0009 ONE HEARS NOW OF THE CHAUSTON THE HALSTEAD PLACE VERY NOTED INDEED THE HULTON THE LEIGH PARK THE STOKE PLACE THE EDINBURGH THE SURBITON THE TRINITY FOOT THE WOODDALE MISSUS G W HILLIARD'S MISSUS PRICE'S AND MISSUS TURNER'S
lbi-4570-14911-0010 EYES BROWN DARK HAZEL OR HAZEL NOT DEEP SET NOR BULGY AND WITH A MILD EXPRESSION
lbi-4570-14911-0011 EARS LONG SET ON LOW FINE IN TEXTURE AND HANGING IN A GRACEFUL FOLD CLOSE TO THE CHEEK
lbi-4570-14911-0012 NECK MODERATELY LONG SLIGHTLY ARCHED THE THROAT SHOWING SOME DEWLAP
lbi-4570-14911-0013 SHOULDERS CLEAN AND SLIGHTLY SLOPING
lbi-4570-14911-0014 FORE LEGS QUITE STRAIGHT WELL UNDER THE DOG OF GOOD SUBSTANCE AND ROUND IN THE BONE
lbi-4570-14911-0015 FEET ROUND WELL KNUCKLED UP AND STRONGLY PADDED
lbi-4570-14911-0016 COAT SMOOTH VARIETY SMOOTH VERY DENSE AND NOT TOO FINE OR SHORT
lbi-4570-14911-0017 HEIGHT NOT EXCEEDING SIXTEEN INCHES
lbi-4570-24733-0000 ALL THINGS WHICH FOLLOW FROM THE ABSOLUTE NATURE OF ANY ATTRIBUTE OF GOD MUST ALWAYS EXIST AND BE INFINITE OR IN OTHER WORDS ARE ETERNAL AND INFINITE THROUGH THE SAID ATTRIBUTE
lbi-4570-24733-0001 PROOF CONCEIVE IF IT BE POSSIBLE SUPPOSING THE PROPOSITION TO BE DENIED THAT SOMETHING IN SOME ATTRIBUTE OF GOD CAN FOLLOW FROM THE ABSOLUTE NATURE OF THE SAID ATTRIBUTE AND THAT AT THE SAME TIME IT IS FINITE AND HAS A CONDITIONED EXISTENCE OR DURATION FOR INSTANCE THE IDEA OF GOD EXPRESSED IN THE ATTRIBUTE THOUGHT
lbi-4570-24733-0002 IN ITS NATURE INFINITE
lbi-4570-24733-0003 MUST NECESSARILY EXIST
lbi-4570-24733-0004 WE HAVE NOW GRANTED THEREFORE THOUGHT NOT CONSTITUTING THE IDEA OF GOD AND ACCORDINGLY THE IDEA OF GOD DOES NOT NATURALLY FOLLOW FROM ITS NATURE IN SO FAR AS IT IS ABSOLUTE THOUGHT FOR IT IS CONCEIVED AS CONSTITUTING AND ALSO AS NOT CONSTITUTING THE IDEA OF GOD WHICH IS AGAINST OUR HYPOTHESIS
lbi-4570-24733-0005 AND BEYOND THE LIMITS OF THE DURATION OF THE IDEA OF GOD SUPPOSING THE LATTER AT SOME TIME NOT TO HAVE EXISTED OR NOT TO BE GOING TO EXIST THOUGHT WOULD PERFORCE HAVE EXISTED WITHOUT THE IDEA OF GOD WHICH IS CONTRARY TO OUR HYPOTHESIS FOR WE SUPPOSED THAT THOUGHT BEING GIVEN THE IDEA OF GOD NECESSARILY FLOWED THEREFROM
lbi-4570-24733-0006 BEAR IN MIND THAT THE SAME PROPOSITION MAY BE AFFIRMED OF ANYTHING WHICH IN ANY ATTRIBUTE NECESSARILY FOLLOWS FROM GOD'S ABSOLUTE NATURE
lbi-4570-24733-0007 COROLLARY HENCE IT FOLLOWS THAT GOD IS NOT ONLY THE CAUSE OF THINGS COMING INTO EXISTENCE BUT ALSO OF THEIR CONTINUING IN EXISTENCE THAT IS IN SCHOLASTIC PHRASEOLOGY GOD IS CAUSE OF THE BEING OF THINGS ESSENDI RERUM
lbi-4570-24733-0008 COROLLARY INDIVIDUAL THINGS ARE NOTHING BUT MODIFICATIONS OF THE ATTRIBUTES OF GOD OR MODES BY WHICH THE ATTRIBUTES OF GOD ARE EXPRESSED IN A FIXED AND DEFINITE MANNER
lbi-4570-56594-0000 SUCH A CORPS SUCH A TIME YOU NEVER DID SEE
lbi-4570-56594-0001 I WAS WISHING SOMEBODY WOULD GIVE THE CONVERSATION A START WHEN INDIANY MADE A BREAK

lbi-4570-56594-0003 NO SIR SAYS THE OLD GENTLEMAN
lbi-4570-56594-0004 THERE'S VERY LITTLE GRAZING HERE AND THE RANGE IS PRETTY MUCH WORE OUT
lbi-4570-56594-0005 THE YOUNG LADY SMILED THROUGH HER VEIL AND THE OLD LADY SNAPPED HER EYES AND LOOKED SIDEWAYS AT THE SPEAKER
lbi-4570-56594-0006 I'M GWINE DOWN TO ORLEANS TO SEE IF I CAN'T GIT A CONTRACT OUT OF UNCLE SAM TO FEED THE BOYS WHAT'S BEEN LICKIN THEM INFERNAL MEXICANS SO BAD
lbi-4570-56594-0007 I'VE READ SOME ACCOUNTS OF THE BATTLE SAYS THE OLD GENTLEMAN THAT DIDN'T GIVE A VERY FLATTERING ACCOUNT OF THE CONDUCT OF SOME OF OUR TROOPS
lbi-4570-56594-0008 THE OLD PREACHER LISTENED TO HIM WITH EVIDENT SIGNS OF DISPLEASURE TWISTIN AND GROANIN TILL HE COULDN'T STAND IT NO LONGER
lbi-4570-56594-0009 HE SHUT HIS MOUTH RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF WHAT HE WAS SAYIN AND LOOKED AT THE PREACHER WHILE HIS FACE GOT AS RED AS FIRE
lbi-4570-56594-0010 SWEARIN SAYS THE OLD PREACHER IS A TERRIBLE BAD PRACTICE AND THERE AIN'T NO USE IN IT NOHOW
lbi-4570-56594-0011 UMPHS BUT INDIANY KEPT SHADY HE APPEARED TO BE COWED DOWN
lbi-4570-56594-0012 THE OLD GENTLEMAN WITH THE CANE TOOK A PART IN THE CONVERSATION AND THE HOOSIER LISTENED WITHOUT EVER OPENING HIS HEAD
lbi-4570-56594-0013 HE WAS AT SODOM AND GOMORROW AND SEEN THE PLACE WHAR LOT'S WIFE FELL AH
