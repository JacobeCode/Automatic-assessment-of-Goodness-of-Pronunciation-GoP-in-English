lbi-6841-88294-0000 AT THIS MOMENT THE HEAVY BEAT OF THE STORM ON THE ROOF CEASED WITH MIRACULOUS SUDDENNESS LEAVING THE OUTSIDE WORLD EMPTY OF SOUND SAVE FOR THE DRIP DRIP DRIP OF EAVES
lbi-6841-88294-0001 WE HAD EVERY SORT OF PEOPLE WITH US OFF AND ON AND AS I WAS LOOKOUT AT A POPULAR GAME I SAW THEM ALL
lbi-6841-88294-0002 AT THE SAME INSTANT I HEARD THE RIP OF STEEL THROUGH CLOTH AND FELT A SHARP STAB IN MY LEFT LEG
lbi-6841-88294-0003 THEN I SCOUTED TO SEE WHAT HAD CUT ME AND FOUND THAT THE FELLOW HAD LOST A HAND
lbi-6841-88294-0004 IN PLACE OF IT HE WORE A SHARP STEEL HOOK
lbi-6841-88294-0005 THERE WAS NO DOUBT OF HIS BEING ALIVE FOR HE WAS BREATHING HARD LIKE A MAN DOES WHEN HE GETS HIT OVER THE HEAD IT DIDN'T SOUND GOOD
lbi-6841-88294-0006 WHEN A MAN BREATHES THAT WAY HE'S MOSTLY ALL GONE
lbi-6841-88294-0007 MEN GOT BATTED OVER THE HEAD OFTEN ENOUGH IN THOSE DAYS
lbi-6841-88294-0008 SOUR WINE IS FINE TO PUT A WOUND IN SHAPE TO HEAL BUT IT'S NO SOOTHING SYRUP
lbi-6841-88294-0009 THEIR COFFIN WAS THEIR SHIP AND THEIR GRAVE IT WAS THE SEA BLOW HIGH BLOW LOW WHAT CARE WE AND THE QUARTER THAT WE GAVE THEM WAS TO SINK THEM IN THE SEA DOWN ON THE COAST OF THE HIGH BARBAREE
lbi-6841-88294-0010 IT FAIR MADE MY HAIR RISE TO HEAR HIM WITH THE BIG STILL SOLEMN DESERT OUTSIDE AND THE QUIET MOONLIGHT AND THE SHADOWS AND HIM SITTING UP STRAIGHT AND GAUNT HIS EYES BLAZING EACH SIDE HIS BIG EAGLE NOSE AND HIS SNAKY HAIR HANGING OVER THE RAW CUT ACROSS HIS HEAD
lbi-6841-88294-0011 HOWEVER I MADE OUT TO GET HIM BANDAGED UP AND IN SHAPE AND PRETTY SOON HE SORT OF WENT TO SLEEP
lbi-6841-88294-0012 THEN AGAIN HE'D SING THAT BARBAREE SONG UNTIL I'D GO OUT AND LOOK AT THE OLD COLORADO FLOWING BY JUST TO BE SURE I HADN'T DIED AND GONE BELOW OR ELSE HE'D JUST TALK
lbi-6841-88294-0013 HE BEGAN WHEN HE WAS A KID AND HE GAVE HIS SIDE OF CONVERSATIONS PAUSING FOR REPLIES
lbi-6841-88294-0014 I USED TO LISTEN BY THE HOUR BUT I NEVER MADE OUT ANYTHING REALLY IMPORTANT AS TO WHO THE MAN WAS OR WHERE HE'D COME FROM OR WHAT HE'D DONE
lbi-6841-88294-0015 I DIDN'T PAY ANY ATTENTION TO HIM FOR HE WAS QUIET
lbi-6841-88294-0016 USUALLY I DIDN'T BOTHER WITH HIS TALK FOR IT DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING BUT SOMETHING IN HIS VOICE MADE ME TURN
lbi-6841-88294-0017 HE WAS LYING ON HIS SIDE THOSE BLACK EYES OF HIS BLAZING AT ME BUT NOW BOTH OF THEM SAW THE SAME DISTANCE
lbi-6841-88294-0018 WHERE ARE MY CLOTHES HE ASKED VERY INTENSE
lbi-6841-88294-0019 ONE LITTLE SQUEEZE TALK ABOUT YOUR DEADLY WEAPONS
lbi-6841-88294-0020 BUT HE'D BEEN TOO SICK AND TOO LONG ABED
lbi-6841-88294-0021 IN A MINUTE OR SO HE CAME TO
lbi-6841-88294-0022 NOW YOU'RE A NICE SWEET PROPOSITION SAID I AS SOON AS I WAS SURE HE COULD UNDERSTAND ME
lbi-6841-88294-0023 THEY'RE SAFE ENOUGH LET ME HAVE THEM HE BEGGED
lbi-6841-88294-0024 NOW LOOK HERE SAID I YOU CAN'T GET UP TO DAY YOU AIN'T FIT
lbi-6841-88294-0025 I KNOW HE PLEADED BUT LET ME SEE THEM
lbi-6841-88294-0026 JUST TO SATISFY HIM I PASSED OVER HIS OLD DUDS
lbi-6841-88294-0027 I'VE BEEN ROBBED HE CRIED
lbi-6841-88294-0028 WHERE'S MY COAT HE ASKED
lbi-6841-88294-0029 YOU HAD NO COAT WHEN I PICKED YOU UP I REPLIED
lbi-6841-88294-0030 HE LOOKED AT ME MIGHTY SUSPICIOUS BUT DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING MORE HE WOULDN'T EVEN ANSWER WHEN I SPOKE TO HIM
lbi-6841-88294-0031 AFTER HE'D EATEN A FAIR MEAL HE FELL ASLEEP
lbi-6841-88294-0032 WHEN I CAME BACK THAT EVENING THE BUNK WAS EMPTY AND HE WAS GONE
lbi-6841-88294-0033 I DIDN'T SEE HIM AGAIN FOR TWO DAYS
lbi-6841-88294-0034 THEN I CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM QUITE A WAYS OFF
lbi-6841-88294-0035 GUESS HE SUSPICIONS I STOLE THAT OLD COAT OF HIS THINKS I AND AFTERWARDS I FOUND THAT MY SURMISE HAD BEEN CORRECT
lbi-6841-88294-0036 HOWEVER HE DIDN'T STAY LONG IN THAT FRAME OF MIND
lbi-6841-88294-0037 I RAN UP PULLING MY GUN
lbi-6841-88294-0038 THE MEX WAS FLAT ON HIS FACE HIS ARMS STRETCHED OUT
lbi-6841-88294-0039 ON THE MIDDLE OF HIS BACK KNELT MY ONE ARMED FRIEND
lbi-6841-88294-0040 ANYWAY I THRUST THE MUZZLE OF MY COLT'S INTO THE SAILOR'S FACE WHAT'S THIS I ASKED
lbi-6841-88294-0041 I WEEN HEEM AT MONTE OFF ANTONIO CURVEZ SAID HE
lbi-6841-88294-0042 THE GLEAM DIED FROM HIS EYE THE SNARL LEFT HIS LIPS
lbi-6841-88294-0043 IN ANY CASE HE FLEW POCO PRONTO LEAVING ME AND MY FRIEND TOGETHER
lbi-6841-88294-0044 DURING THE NEXT TWO MONTHS HE WAS A GOOD DEAL ABOUT TOWN MOSTLY DOING ODD JOBS I SAW HIM OFF AND ON
lbi-6841-88294-0045 HOWEVER I DIDN'T PAY MUCH ATTENTION TO THAT BEING AT THE TIME ALMIGHTY BUSY HOLDING DOWN MY CARD GAMES
lbi-6841-88294-0046 THAT'S ALL RIGHT SAID I BUT YOU BETTER STAY RIGHT THERE
lbi-6841-88294-0047 I WANT TO MAKE UP TO YOU FOR YOUR TROUBLE SAID HE
lbi-6841-88294-0048 WHAT KIND OF A GOOD THING I ASKED TREASURE SAID HE
lbi-6841-88294-0049 HE LOOKED ALL RIGHT ENOUGH NEITHER DRUNK NOR LOCO
lbi-6841-88294-0050 SIT DOWN SAID I OVER THERE THE OTHER SIDE THE TABLE
lbi-6841-88294-0051 HE DID SO NOW FIRE AWAY SAID I
lbi-6841-88294-0052 AND IT'S A BIG THING SAID HANDY SOLOMON TO ME FOR THEY'S NOT ONLY GOLD BUT ALTAR JEWELS AND DIAMONDS
lbi-6841-88294-0053 IT WILL MAKE US RICH AND A DOZEN LIKE US AND YOU CAN KISS THE BOOK ON THAT
lbi-6841-88294-0054 THAT MAY ALL BE TRUE SAID I BUT WHY DO YOU TELL ME
lbi-6841-88294-0055 WHY DON'T YOU GET YOUR TREASURE WITHOUT THE NEED OF DIVIDING IT
lbi-6841-88294-0056 WHY MATE HE ANSWERED IT'S JUST PLAIN GRATITUDE
lbi-6841-88294-0057 DIDN'T YOU SAVE MY LIFE AND NUSS ME AND TAKE CARE OF ME WHEN I WAS NIGH KILLED
lbi-6841-88294-0058 LOOK HERE ANDERSON OR HANDY SOLOMON OR WHATEVER YOU PLEASE TO CALL YOURSELF I REJOINED TO THIS IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO BUSINESS WITH ME AND I DO NOT UNDERSTAND YET JUST WHAT IT IS YOU WANT OF ME YOU'LL HAVE TO TALK STRAIGHT
lbi-6841-88294-0059 IT'S ALL VERY WELL TO SAY GRATITUDE BUT THAT DON'T GO WITH ME
lbi-6841-88294-0060 THE DEVIL'S A PREACHER IF YOU AIN'T LOST YOUR PINFEATHERS SAID HE
lbi-6841-88294-0061 WELL IT'S THIS THEN I GOT TO HAVE A BOAT TO GET THERE AND SHE MUST BE STOCKED
lbi-6841-88294-0062 AND I GOT TO HAVE HELP WITH THE TREASURE IF IT'S LIKE THIS FELLOW SAID IT WAS
lbi-6841-88294-0063 IT'S MONEY I GOT TO HAVE AND IT'S MONEY I HAVEN'T GOT AND CAN'T GET UNLESS I LET SOMEBODY IN AS PARDNER
lbi-6841-88294-0064 WHY ME I ASKED WHY NOT HE RETORTED
lbi-6841-88294-0065 WE TALKED THE MATTER OVER AT LENGTH
lbi-6841-88294-0066 I STOOD OUT FOR A LARGER PARTY
lbi-6841-88294-0067 HE STRONGLY OPPOSED THIS AS DEPRECIATING THE SHARES BUT I HAD NO INTENTION OF GOING ALONE INTO WHAT WAS THEN CONSIDERED A WILD AND DANGEROUS COUNTRY FINALLY WE COMPROMISED
lbi-6841-88294-0068 A THIRD OF THE TREASURE WAS TO GO TO HIM A THIRD TO ME AND THE REST WAS TO BE DIVIDED AMONG THE MEN WHOM I SHOULD SELECT THIS SCHEME DID NOT APPEAL TO HIM
lbi-700-122866-0000 JUNIOR AVONLEA FOUND IT HARD TO SETTLE DOWN TO HUMDRUM EXISTENCE AGAIN
lbi-700-122866-0001 PERHAPS AFTER A WHILE I'LL GET USED TO IT BUT I'M AFRAID CONCERTS SPOIL PEOPLE FOR EVERYDAY LIFE
lbi-700-122866-0002 I SUPPOSE THAT IS WHY MARILLA DISAPPROVES OF THEM
lbi-700-122866-0003 I FEEL JUST NOW THAT I MAY GROW UP TO BE SENSIBLE YET
lbi-700-122866-0004 I JUST LAY AWAKE AND IMAGINED THE CONCERT OVER AND OVER AGAIN
lbi-700-122866-0005 EVENTUALLY HOWEVER AVONLEA SCHOOL SLIPPED BACK INTO ITS OLD GROOVE AND TOOK UP ITS OLD INTERESTS
lbi-700-122866-0006 NONE OF THE SLOANES WOULD HAVE ANY DEALINGS WITH THE BELLS BECAUSE THE BELLS HAD DECLARED THAT THE SLOANES HAD TOO MUCH TO DO IN THE PROGRAM AND THE SLOANES HAD RETORTED THAT THE BELLS WERE NOT CAPABLE OF DOING THE LITTLE THEY HAD TO DO PROPERLY
lbi-700-122866-0007 THE WINTER WEEKS SLIPPED BY
lbi-700-122866-0008 ON ANNE'S BIRTHDAY THEY WERE TRIPPING LIGHTLY DOWN IT KEEPING EYES AND EARS ALERT AMID ALL THEIR CHATTER FOR MISS STACY HAD TOLD THEM THAT THEY MUST SOON WRITE A COMPOSITION ON A WINTER'S WALK IN THE WOODS AND IT BEHOOVED THEM TO BE OBSERVANT
lbi-700-122866-0009 I CAN SCARCELY REALIZE THAT I'M IN MY TEENS
lbi-700-122866-0010 IT'S A GREAT COMFORT TO THINK THAT I'LL BE ABLE TO USE BIG WORDS THEN WITHOUT BEING LAUGHED AT
lbi-700-122866-0011 RUBY GILLIS THINKS OF NOTHING BUT BEAUS SAID ANNE DISDAINFULLY
lbi-700-122866-0012 SHE'S ACTUALLY DELIGHTED WHEN ANYONE WRITES HER NAME UP IN A TAKE NOTICE FOR ALL SHE PRETENDS TO BE SO MAD
lbi-700-122866-0013 I'M TRYING TO BE AS MUCH LIKE MISSUS ALLAN AS I POSSIBLY CAN FOR I THINK SHE'S PERFECT
lbi-700-122866-0014 IF I HAD ALICE BELL'S CROOKED NOSE SAID ANNE DECIDEDLY I WOULDN'T BUT THERE
lbi-700-122866-0015 I'M AFRAID I THINK TOO MUCH ABOUT MY NOSE EVER SINCE I HEARD THAT COMPLIMENT ABOUT IT LONG AGO
lbi-700-122866-0016 OH DIANA LOOK THERE'S A RABBIT
lbi-700-122866-0017 THEY'RE SO WHITE AND STILL AS IF THEY WERE ASLEEP AND DREAMING PRETTY DREAMS
lbi-700-122866-0018 I WROTE IT LAST MONDAY EVENING
lbi-700-122866-0019 IT'S CALLED THE JEALOUS RIVAL OR IN DEATH NOT DIVIDED
lbi-700-122866-0020 I READ IT TO MARILLA AND SHE SAID IT WAS STUFF AND NONSENSE
lbi-700-122866-0021 IT'S A SAD SWEET STORY
lbi-700-122866-0022 CORDELIA WAS A REGAL BRUNETTE WITH A CORONET OF MIDNIGHT HAIR AND DUSKLY FLASHING EYES
lbi-700-122866-0023 YOU KNOW SO MUCH MORE THAN YOU DID WHEN YOU WERE ONLY TWELVE
lbi-700-122866-0024 THEY GREW IN BEAUTY SIDE BY SIDE UNTIL THEY WERE SIXTEEN
lbi-700-122866-0025 I ASKED RUBY GILLIS IF SHE KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT HOW MEN PROPOSED BECAUSE I THOUGHT SHE'D LIKELY BE AN AUTHORITY ON THE SUBJECT HAVING SO MANY SISTERS MARRIED
lbi-700-122866-0026 BUT SHE PRETENDED TO BE GERALDINE'S FRIEND THE SAME AS EVER
lbi-700-122866-0027 LET YOU AND ME HAVE A STORY CLUB ALL OUR OWN AND WRITE STORIES FOR PRACTICE
lbi-700-122866-0028 YOU OUGHT TO CULTIVATE YOUR IMAGINATION YOU KNOW MISS STACY SAYS SO
lbi-700-122866-0029 ONLY WE MUST TAKE THE RIGHT WAY
lbi-700-122866-0030 THIS WAS HOW THE STORY CLUB CAME INTO EXISTENCE
lbi-700-122866-0031 NO BOYS WERE ALLOWED IN IT ALTHOUGH RUBY GILLIS OPINED THAT THEIR ADMISSION WOULD MAKE IT MORE EXCITING AND EACH MEMBER HAD TO PRODUCE ONE STORY A WEEK
lbi-700-122866-0032 EACH GIRL HAS TO READ HER STORY OUT LOUD AND THEN WE TALK IT OVER
lbi-700-122866-0033 MINE IS ROSAMOND MONTMORENCY ALL THE GIRLS DO PRETTY WELL
lbi-700-122866-0034 I'M SURE THAT MUST HAVE A WHOLESOME EFFECT
lbi-700-122866-0035 THE MORAL IS THE GREAT THING MISTER ALLAN SAYS SO
lbi-700-122866-0036 I READ ONE OF MY STORIES TO HIM AND MISSUS ALLAN AND THEY BOTH AGREED THAT THE MORAL WAS EXCELLENT
lbi-700-122866-0037 JANE AND RUBY ALMOST ALWAYS CRY WHEN I COME TO THE PATHETIC PARTS
lbi-700-122866-0038 MISS JOSEPHINE BARRY WROTE BACK THAT SHE HAD NEVER READ ANYTHING SO AMUSING IN HER LIFE
lbi-700-122866-0039 I'M SURE MISSUS ALLAN WAS NEVER SUCH A SILLY FORGETFUL LITTLE GIRL AS YOU ARE
lbi-700-122866-0040 I FELT SO ENCOURAGED WHEN I HEARD THAT
lbi-700-122866-0041 MISSUS LYNDE SAYS SHE ALWAYS FEELS SHOCKED WHEN SHE HEARS OF ANYONE EVER HAVING BEEN NAUGHTY NO MATTER HOW SMALL THEY WERE
lbi-700-122866-0042 NOW I WOULDN'T HAVE FELT THAT WAY
