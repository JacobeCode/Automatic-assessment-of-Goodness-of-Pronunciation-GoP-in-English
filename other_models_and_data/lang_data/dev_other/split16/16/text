lbi-8254-115543-0000 THE NEXT DAY EVERYBODY IN THE HOUSE BEGAN TO MAKE PREPARATIONS FOR THE JOURNEY
lbi-8254-115543-0001 EVERYTHING WAS DONE VERY LEISURELY THOUGH THERE WAS A LOT OF TALKING AND DISPUTING AND THE GIVING OF CONTRARY ORDERS
lbi-8254-115543-0002 THE OLD PORTER WAS THERE DIRECTING AND SCOLDING THE SERVANTS AS THEY PILED THE RUGS AND BLANKETS AND BAGS OF FOOD AND POTS AND PANS AND DISHES INTO THE WAGON
lbi-8254-115543-0003 THERE WAS QUITE A PROCESSION WHEN AT LAST THE BIG WAGON RUMBLED OUT THROUGH THE GATEWAY
lbi-8254-115543-0004 BEHIND IT CAME THE GRANDMOTHER IN HER DHOOLIE DAK A SORT OF A LITTER OR EASY CHAIR SWUNG BETWEEN TWO LONG POLES
lbi-8254-115543-0005 BESIDES THE FAMILY THERE WERE MANY SERVANTS AND SEVERAL OTHERS WALKED BESIDE THE SLOW MOVING WAGON
lbi-8254-115543-0006 THE COOK TOO WENT WITH THEM
lbi-8254-115543-0007 GOOD BYE SHOUTED LITTLE NAO FROM HIS GARDEN WALL AS THEY WENT BY GOOD BYE
lbi-8254-115543-0008 THEY SHOUTED GREETINGS TO THEIR FRIEND THE POTTER AS THEY PASSED HIM AND ALSO TO THE OLD FAKIR SMEARED ALL OVER WITH ASHES WHO SAT IN A LITTLE BRICK HUT BY THE BRIDGE AND PRETENDED TO MAKE WONDERFUL CURES
lbi-8254-115543-0009 THIS IS MORE FUN THAN GOING TO SCHOOL SAID CHOLA AS THE OXEN PLODDED ALONG THROUGH CLOUDS OF DUST
lbi-8254-115543-0010 THESE LOVELY BIRDS ARE FOUND NEARLY EVERYWHERE IN INDIA AND IN SOME PARTS RUN QUITE WILD
lbi-8254-115543-0011 HIS LONG MATTED HAIR HUNG ON HIS SHOULDERS AND HE WAS SAYING HIS PRAYERS WITH THE HELP OF A ROSARY OF BEADS WHICH HE CONTINUALLY PASSED THROUGH HIS HANDS
lbi-8254-115543-0012 AS THE WAGON CAME UP A YOUNG MAN WHO ACCOMPANIED THE HOLY MAN RAN UP AND HELD OUT A BEGGING BOWL SAYING GIVE OH CHARITABLE PEOPLE TO THIS HOLY ONE
lbi-8254-115543-0013 NO COUNTRY IN THE WORLD HAS SO MANY BEGGARS AS INDIA
lbi-8254-115543-0014 MANY OF THEM ARE CALLED HOLY MEN BECAUSE THEY DO NOTHING BUT MAKE PILGRIMAGES FROM ONE SACRED PLACE TO ANOTHER LIVING SOLELY ON THE ALMS THAT ARE GIVEN TO THEM
lbi-8254-115543-0015 WHEN THEY HAD EATEN THEIR LUNCH THE YOUNG PEOPLE WENT TO EXPLORE THE GARDEN NEAR THEM
lbi-8254-115543-0016 PERHAPS THERE ARE DOGS SAID MAHALA A LITTLE FEARFULLY BUT THEY FORGOT ABOUT DOGS WHEN THEY SAW A THICKET OF SUGAR CANE DOWN BY A STREAM
lbi-8254-115543-0017 PERHAPS WE CAN BUY SOME FROM THE MAN THERE HE IS NOW PLOUGHING BY THE STREAM SAID CHOLA
lbi-8254-115543-0018 IT IS LOOKING FOR WATER SAID THE FARMER AS HE TOOK A LONG STALK OF CANE AND GENTLY GUIDED IT DOWN TO THE STREAM
lbi-8254-115543-0019 THE SNAKE IS ANOTHER SACRED ANIMAL OF THE HINDUS AND THEY WOULD NOT KILL OR INJURE ONE FOR ANYTHING
lbi-8254-115543-0020 AS THEY WERE ABOUT TO MOVE ON AGAIN THEY SAW A GREAT CLOUD OF DUST DOWN THE ROAD
lbi-8254-115543-0021 IT TURNED OUT THAT IT WAS A GREAT AND POWERFUL RAJAH GOING IN STATE ON A JOURNEY TO VISIT ANOTHER RAJAH OR RULER OF ONE OF THE SMALL KINGDOMS OR STATES OF WHICH MODERN INDIA WAS FORMERLY MADE UP
lbi-8254-115543-0022 FIRST THERE CAME A BIG ELEPHANT ALL DECORATED WITH SILK AND GOLD AND SILVER
lbi-8254-115543-0023 ON THE ELEPHANT'S BACK WAS A HOWDAH WHICH IS LIKE A BIG CHAIR WITH A CANOPY OVER IT AND IN THIS SITTING CROSS LEGGED WAS THE RAJAH A BIG FAT FELLOW DRESSED IN COLOURED SILKS AND JEWELS WITH A GREAT DIAMOND SET PLUME IN HIS TURBAN
lbi-8254-115543-0024 BEHIND THE HOWDAH STOOD A SERVANT HOLDING A BIG UMBRELLA OF FINE FEATHERS OVER THE RAJAH'S HEAD
lbi-8254-115543-0025 THE DRIVER SAT ON THE NECK OF THE ELEPHANT AND GUIDED THE BIG BEAST BY PRODDING HIM ON ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER WITH AN IRON SHOD STICK OR GOAD
lbi-8254-115543-0026 ISN'T IT FINE TO RIDE LIKE THAT ON A BIG ELEPHANT
lbi-8254-115543-0027 AND ALL THE REST OF THE DAY THE LITTLE FOLK TALKED OF NOTHING BUT THE GREAT RAJAH AND HIS ESCORT
lbi-8254-115543-0028 OUR PARTY CAME TO A HALT AMONG MANY OTHER BULLOCK CARTS THE OWNERS OF WHICH WERE ALREADY SITTING AROUND ON THE GROUND COOKING THEIR SUPPERS OR BARGAINING FOR FOOD AT THE LITTLE BOOTHS
lbi-8254-115543-0029 THESE THEY USED FOR PLATES HEAPING THEM UP WITH THEIR BOILED RICE AND CURRY AND FISH AND ALL SORTS OF PUDDINGS AND SWEETS
lbi-8254-115543-0030 AS SUPPER WAS BEING EATEN ANOTHER PARTY STOPPED AT THE PARAO AND CAMPED NOT FAR AWAY
lbi-8254-115543-0031 WHEN THE LITTER WAS PUT DOWN A YOUNG BOY STEPPED OUT LOOKING VERY PROUD AND HAUGHTY
lbi-8254-115543-0032 HIS SERVANTS AT ONCE SPREAD A HANDSOME RUG ON THE GROUND FOR HIM TO SIT ON AND RUSHED ABOUT WAITING ON HIM TAKING GOOD CARE TO KEEP EVERY ONE AT A DISTANCE
lbi-8254-115543-0033 YES AND HOW HE ORDERS EVERY ONE ABOUT HIM
lbi-8254-115543-0034 AROUND THE LITTLE BRAHMIN'S NECK WAS A THIN CORD OR THREAD WHICH WAS THE SIGN OF HIS HIGH CASTE
lbi-8254-115543-0035 MEANWHILE THE HAUGHTY LITTLE BRAHMIN ATE HIS SUPPER WITH HIS HEAD TURNED AWAY SO NO ONE COULD SEE HIM EAT AND THEN GROWING TIRED OF RESPECTFUL GLANCES OF THE CROWD AROUND HIM HE GOT INTO HIS LITTER AGAIN AND THE SERVANTS FASTENED THE CURTAINS TIGHTLY AROUND HIM
lbi-8254-115543-0036 EVERYBODY SLEPT SOUNDLY IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT ONE OF THE SERVANTS WAS BEATING A DRUM MOST OF THE NIGHT WHICH THEY REALLY BELIEVED WAS THE WAY TO KEEP OFF EVIL SPIRITS
lbi-8254-115543-0037 OH THE THIEVES HE CRIED
lbi-8254-115543-0038 THEY ARE AS BAD AS THE BEGGARS

lbi-8254-115543-0040 HE AND CHOLA WERE WALKING BESIDE THE WAGON FOR A CHANGE
lbi-8254-115543-0041 THE LATTICES WERE RAISED SO SHRIYA AND HER MOTHER AND AUNT COULD ENJOY THE FRESH AIR
lbi-8254-115543-0042 THEY ARE MY DOLLS SAID THE LITTLE GIRL SADLY AS SHE PATTED THE BUNDLE BESIDE HER
lbi-8254-115543-0043 I TAKE THEM AS AN OFFERING TO THE HOLY RIVER POOR LITTLE WOMAN
lbi-8254-115543-0044 MUST THOU SACRIFICE THY TOYS TOO
