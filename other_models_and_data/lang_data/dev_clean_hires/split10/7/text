lbi-5536-43363-0000 REINCARNATION AND THE CONVERSE OF SPIRITS
lbi-5536-43363-0001 THEREFORE HE COURTS DEATH IN BATTLE ON THE OTHER HAND HE WOULD REGARD IT AS DISGRACEFUL TO BE KILLED IN A PRIVATE QUARREL
lbi-5536-43363-0002 THE MEN BLACKEN THEIR FACES AND WIDOWS OR BEREAVED PARENTS SOMETIMES GASH THEIR ARMS AND LEGS TILL THEY ARE COVERED WITH BLOOD
lbi-5536-43363-0003 GIVING THEMSELVES UP WHOLLY TO THEIR GRIEF THEY ARE NO LONGER CONCERNED ABOUT ANY EARTHLY POSSESSION AND OFTEN GIVE AWAY ALL THAT THEY HAVE TO THE FIRST COMERS EVEN TO THEIR BEDS AND THEIR HOME
lbi-5536-43363-0004 IT WAS PREPARED BY DRESSING IN THE FINEST CLOTHES TOGETHER WITH SOME PERSONAL POSSESSIONS AND ORNAMENTS WRAPPED IN SEVERAL ROBES AND FINALLY IN A SECURE COVERING OF RAW HIDE
lbi-5536-43363-0005 AS A SPECIAL MARK OF RESPECT THE BODY OF A YOUNG WOMAN OR A WARRIOR WAS SOMETIMES LAID OUT IN STATE IN A NEW TEEPEE WITH THE USUAL HOUSEHOLD ARTICLES AND EVEN WITH A DISH OF FOOD LEFT BESIDE IT NOT THAT THEY SUPPOSED THE SPIRIT COULD USE THE IMPLEMENTS OR EAT THE FOOD BUT MERELY AS A LAST TRIBUTE
lbi-5536-43363-0006 IF A MAN WERE SLAIN IN BATTLE IT WAS AN OLD CUSTOM TO PLACE HIS BODY AGAINST A TREE OR ROCK IN A SITTING POSITION ALWAYS FACING THE ENEMY TO INDICATE HIS UNDAUNTED DEFIANCE AND BRAVERY EVEN IN DEATH
lbi-5536-43363-0007 AT EVERY MEAL TIME A DISH OF FOOD WAS PLACED UNDER IT AND SOME PERSON OF THE SAME SEX AND AGE AS THE ONE WHO WAS GONE MUST AFTERWARD BE INVITED IN TO PARTAKE OF THE FOOD
lbi-5536-43363-0008 AT THE END OF A YEAR FROM THE TIME OF DEATH THE RELATIVES MADE A PUBLIC FEAST AND GAVE AWAY THE CLOTHING AND OTHER GIFTS WHILE THE LOCK OF HAIR WAS INTERRED WITH APPROPRIATE CEREMONIES
lbi-5536-43363-0009 IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT THE AMERICAN INDIAN HAD SOMEHOW DEVELOPED OCCULT POWER AND ALTHOUGH IN THE LATTER DAYS THERE HAVE BEEN MANY IMPOSTORS AND ALLOWING FOR THE VANITY AND WEAKNESS OF HUMAN NATURE IT IS FAIR TO ASSUME THAT THERE MUST HAVE BEEN SOME EVEN IN THE OLD DAYS YET THERE ARE WELL ATTESTED INSTANCES OF REMARKABLE PROPHECIES AND OTHER MYSTIC PRACTICE
lbi-5536-43363-0010 NO DOUBT MANY PREDICTIONS HAVE BEEN COLORED TO SUIT THE NEW AGE AND UNQUESTIONABLY FALSE PROPHETS FAKIRS AND CONJURERS HAVE BECOME THE PEST OF THE TRIBES DURING THE TRANSITION PERIOD
lbi-5536-43363-0011 THIS WAS CARRIED OUT TO THE LETTER
lbi-5536-43363-0012 THIS WAS ONLY ONE OF HIS REMARKABLE PROPHECIES
lbi-5536-43363-0013 ANOTHER FAMOUS MEDICINE MAN WAS BORN ON THE RUM RIVER ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS AGO AND LIVED TO BE OVER A CENTURY OLD
lbi-5536-43363-0014 AT THE AGE OF ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE YEARS HE SAVED HIS BAND FROM UTTER DESTRUCTION AT THE HANDS OF THEIR ANCESTRAL ENEMIES BY SUDDENLY GIVING WARNING RECEIVED IN A DREAM OF THE APPROACH OF A LARGE WAR PARTY
lbi-5536-43363-0015 FIVE YEARS LATER HE REPEATED THE SERVICE AND AGAIN SAVED HIS PEOPLE FROM AWFUL SLAUGHTER
lbi-5536-43363-0016 THERE ARE MANY TRUSTWORTHY MEN AND MEN OF CHRISTIAN FAITH TO VOUCH FOR THESE AND SIMILAR EVENTS OCCURRING AS FORETOLD
lbi-5536-43363-0017 AT ANOTHER TIME WHEN I WAS FOURTEEN YEARS OLD WE HAD JUST LEFT FORT ELLIS ON THE ASSINIBOINE RIVER AND MY YOUNGEST UNCLE HAD SELECTED A FINE SPOT FOR OUR NIGHT CAMP
lbi-5536-43363-0018 MANY OF THE INDIANS BELIEVED THAT ONE MAY BE BORN MORE THAN ONCE AND THERE WERE SOME WHO CLAIMED TO HAVE FULL KNOWLEDGE OF A FORMER INCARNATION
lbi-5536-43363-0019 THERE WAS A WELL KNOWN SIOUX WAR PROPHET WHO LIVED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LAST CENTURY SO THAT HE IS STILL REMEMBERED BY THE OLD MEN OF HIS BAND
lbi-5694-64025-0000 SHILOH
lbi-5694-64025-0001 THIS WAS THE FIRST BIG BATTLE IN WHICH OUR REGIMENT HAD EVER BEEN ENGAGED
lbi-5694-64025-0002 I DO NOT PRETEND TO TELL OF WHAT COMMAND DISTINGUISHED ITSELF OF HEROES OF BLOOD AND WOUNDS OF SHRIEKS AND GROANS OF BRILLIANT CHARGES OF CANNON CAPTURED ET CETERA
lbi-5694-64025-0003 ABOUT DAYLIGHT ON SUNDAY MORNING CHALMERS BRIGADE RELIEVED GLADDEN'S
lbi-5694-64025-0004 AS GLADDEN RODE BY US A COURIER RODE UP AND TOLD HIM SOMETHING
lbi-5694-64025-0005 ON SUNDAY MORNING A CLEAR BEAUTIFUL AND STILL DAY THE ORDER WAS GIVEN FOR THE WHOLE ARMY TO ADVANCE AND TO ATTACK IMMEDIATELY
lbi-5694-64025-0006 WE WERE SUPPORTING AN ALABAMA BRIGADE
lbi-5694-64025-0007 THAT'S RIGHT MY BRAVE FIRST TENNESSEE GIVE EM HAIL COLUMBIA
lbi-5694-64025-0008 THE FACT WAS KEPT FROM THE TROOPS
lbi-5694-64025-0009 WE HAD TO PASS OVER THE GROUND WHERE TROOPS HAD BEEN FIGHTING ALL DAY
lbi-5694-64025-0010 I HAD HEARD AND READ OF BATTLEFIELDS SEEN PICTURES OF BATTLEFIELDS OF HORSES AND MEN OF CANNON AND WAGONS ALL JUMBLED TOGETHER WHILE THE GROUND WAS STREWN WITH DEAD AND DYING AND WOUNDED BUT I MUST CONFESS THAT I NEVER REALIZED THE POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE OF THE THING CALLED GLORIOUS WAR UNTIL I SAW THIS
lbi-5694-64025-0011 I HAD BEEN FEELING MEAN ALL THE MORNING AS IF I HAD STOLEN A SHEEP BUT WHEN THE ORDER TO CHARGE WAS GIVEN I GOT HAPPY
lbi-5694-64025-0012 OFFICERS COULD NOT CURB THE MEN TO KEEP IN LINE
lbi-5694-64025-0013 ON MONDAY THE TIDE WAS REVERSED
lbi-5694-64025-0014 BUT AS I SAID BEFORE READER A PRIVATE SOLDIER IS BUT AN AUTOMATON AND KNOWS NOTHING OF WHAT IS GOING ON AMONG THE GENERALS AND I AM ONLY GIVING THE CHRONICLES OF LITTLE THINGS AND EVENTS THAT CAME UNDER MY OWN OBSERVATION AS I SAW THEM THEN AND REMEMBER THEM NOW
lbi-5694-64025-0015 SHOULD YOU DESIRE TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THE BATTLE I REFER YOU TO HISTORY
lbi-5694-64025-0016 ABOUT THE TIME HE PULLED TRIGGER A STRAY BALL FROM SOME DIRECTION STRUCK HIM IN THE SIDE AND HE FELL OFF DEAD AND HIS HORSE BECOMING FRIGHTENED GALLOPED OFF DRAGGING HIM THROUGH THE CONFEDERATE LINES
lbi-5694-64025-0017 ON MONDAY MORNING I TOO CAPTURED ME A MULE
lbi-5694-64025-0018 HE WAS WISE IN HIS OWN CONCEIT
lbi-5694-64025-0019 I FREQUENTLY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE PLEASANT TO SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE WITH THAT MULE AND I WOULD GLADLY HAVE DONE SO IF I COULD HAVE GOTTEN ONE HALF OF HIS NO
lbi-5694-64025-0020 MULE DID NOT DESIRE TO CROSS WHILE I WAS TRYING TO PERSUADE HIM WITH A BIG STICK A ROCK IN HIS EAR AND A TWISTER ON HIS NOSE
lbi-5694-64025-0021 SO HE GOT A LARGE TWO INCH ROPE TIED ONE END AROUND THE MULE'S NECK AND THE OTHER TO THE CAISSON AND ORDERED THE DRIVER TO WHIP UP
lbi-5694-64025-0022 THE ROPE HOWEVER WAS STRONGER THAN THE MULE'S NO AND HE WAS FINALLY PREVAILED UPON BY THE STRENGTH OF THE ROPE TO CROSS THE CREEK
lbi-5694-64025-0023 ON MY TAKING THE ROPE OFF HE SHOOK HIMSELF AND SEEMED TO SAY YOU THINK THAT YOU ARE MIGHTY SMART FOLKS BUT YOU ARE A LEETLE TOO SMART
lbi-5694-64029-0000 WE REMAINED SEVERAL MONTHS BUT SOON WE WERE ON THE TRAMP AGAIN
lbi-5694-64029-0001 THE FEDERAL ARMY WAS CONCENTRATING AT NASHVILLE THERE WAS NO REST FOR THE WEARY
lbi-5694-64029-0002 OUR ARMY STOPPED AT MURFREESBORO
lbi-5694-64029-0003 FROM TIME TO TIME DIFFERENT REGIMENTS WERE SENT FORWARD TO DO PICKET DUTY
lbi-5694-64029-0004 THE YANKEE PICKET LINES WERE NOT A HALF MILE OFF
lbi-5694-64029-0005 I AM A VIDET YOU KNOW THE RESPONSIBILITY RESTING ON ME
lbi-5694-64029-0006 SAYS HE I WOULD NOT TRUST A SECESH ON HIS WORD OATH OR BOND MARCH I SAY
lbi-5694-64029-0007 I SOON FOUND OUT THAT HE HAD CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE RELIEF ON THE ROAD AND WAS AFRAID TO SHOOT I QUICKLY MADE UP MY MIND
lbi-5694-64029-0008 MY GUN WAS AT MY FEET AND ONE STEP WOULD GET IT
lbi-5694-64029-0009 I MADE A QUICK GLANCE OVER MY SHOULDER AND GRABBED AT MY GUN
lbi-5694-64029-0010 HE DIVINED MY MOTIVE AND FIRED THE BALL MISSED ITS AIM
lbi-5694-64029-0011 I THINK WE MUST HAVE KILLED A GOOD MANY IN THE OLD FIELD BECAUSE WE WERE FIRING ALL THE TIME AT THE SOLID LINE AS THEY ADVANCED UPON US
lbi-5694-64029-0012 WE KEPT FALLING BACK AND FIRING ALL DAY AND WERE RELIEVED BY ANOTHER REGIMENT ABOUT DARK WE REJOINED OUR REGIMENT
lbi-5694-64029-0013 LINE OF BATTLE WAS FORMED ON THE NORTH BANK OF STONE'S RIVER ON THE YANKEE SIDE
lbi-5694-64029-0014 BAD GENERALSHIP I THOUGHT IT WAS CHRISTMAS
lbi-5694-64029-0015 THE PRIVATE COULD BUT HE WAS NO GENERAL YOU SEE
lbi-5694-64029-0016 I CALLED LIEUTENANT COLONEL FRIERSON'S ATTENTION TO THE YANKEES AND HE REMARKED WELL I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THEY ARE YANKEES OR NOT BUT IF THEY ARE THEY WILL COME OUT OF THERE MIGHTY QUICK
lbi-5694-64029-0017 THE YANKEES MARCHED OVER THE HILL OUT OF SIGHT
lbi-5694-64029-0018 WE WERE ORDERED FORWARD TO THE ATTACK
lbi-5694-64029-0019 WE WERE RIGHT UPON THE YANKEE LINE ON THE WILKERSON TURNPIKE
lbi-5694-64029-0020 WE WERE NOT TWENTY YARDS OFF FROM THE YANKEES AND THEY WERE POURING THE HOT SHOT AND SHELLS RIGHT INTO OUR RANKS AND EVERY MAN WAS YELLING AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE CEASE FIRING YOU ARE FIRING ON YOUR OWN MEN CEASE FIRING YOU ARE FIRING ON YOUR OWN MEN
lbi-5694-64029-0021 OAKLEY COLOR BEARER OF THE FOURTH TENNESSEE REGIMENT RAN RIGHT UP IN THE MIDST OF THE YANKEE LINE WITH HIS COLORS BEGGING HIS MEN TO FOLLOW
lbi-5694-64029-0022 THE LEADEN HAIL STORM SWEPT THEM OFF THE FIELD THEY FELL BACK AND RE FORMED
lbi-5694-64029-0023 WE WERE AT THAT TIME AT LEAST A HUNDRED YARDS IN ADVANCE OF THE BRIGADE CHEATHAM ALL THE TIME CALLING UPON THE MEN TO COME ON
lbi-5694-64029-0024 I SAW AND FELT THAT HE WAS NOT FIGHTING FOR GLORY BUT THAT HE WAS FIGHTING FOR HIS COUNTRY BECAUSE HE LOVED THAT COUNTRY AND HE WAS WILLING TO GIVE HIS LIFE FOR HIS COUNTRY AND THE SUCCESS OF OUR CAUSE
lbi-5694-64029-0025 I THOUGHT IT HAD BEEN TORN FROM MY SHOULDER
lbi-5694-64029-0026 AS I WENT BACK TO THE FIELD HOSPITAL I OVERTOOK ANOTHER MAN WALKING ALONG
lbi-5694-64029-0027 I LOOKED AT IT PRETTY CLOSE AND I SAID GREAT GOD
lbi-5694-64029-0028 HE WAS WALKING ALONG WHEN ALL AT ONCE HE DROPPED DOWN AND DIED WITHOUT A STRUGGLE OR A GROAN
lbi-5694-64029-0029 BUT I COULD NOT BEAR THE THOUGHT OF WEARING DEAD MEN'S SHOES
lbi-5694-64029-0030 HE WAS STONE DEAD BUT I DROPPED THAT FOOT QUICK
lbi-5694-64029-0031 BEFORE WE ARRIVED AT THE HOUSE WE SAW A BODY OF YANKEES APPROACHING AND AS WE STARTED TO RUN BACK THEY FIRED UPON US
lbi-5694-64029-0032 OUR PICKETS HAD RUN IN AND REPORTED A NIGHT ATTACK
lbi-5694-64038-0000 ADVANCE INTO TENNESSEE
lbi-5694-64038-0001 YANK SAYS WHAT YOU DOING JOHNNY
lbi-5694-64038-0002 WE PASSED AROUND ATLANTA CROSSED THE CHATTAHOOCHEE AND TRAVELED BACK OVER THE SAME ROUTE ON WHICH WE HAD MADE THE ARDUOUS CAMPAIGN UNDER JOE JOHNSTON
lbi-5694-64038-0003 OUTSIDE OF THESE OCCASIONAL REMINDERS WE COULD SEE NO EVIDENCE OF THE DESOLATION OF THE TRACK OF AN INVADING ARMY
lbi-5694-64038-0004 WE SAW THE UNITED STATES FLAG FLYING FROM THE RAMPARTS AND THOUGHT THAT YANK WOULD PROBABLY BE ASLEEP OR CATCHING LICE OR MAYBE ENGAGED IN A GAME OF SEVEN UP
lbi-5694-64038-0005 HE WALKED UP AND SAYS HELLO BOYS WHAT IS IT BOSS
lbi-5694-64038-0006 A YANKEE ALWAYS SAYS NAGER
lbi-5694-64038-0007 THEY PERSUADED ELOQUENTLY
lbi-5694-64038-0008 A MAN IN THE WELL
lbi-5694-64038-0009 THE VOICE APPEARED TO BE OVERHEAD
lbi-5694-64038-0010 RIGHT BEFORE ME I SAW THE LONG DRY GRASS ALL BENDING TOWARD A COMMON CENTER AND I KNEW THAT IT WAS AN OLD WELL AND THAT MY COMRADE HAD FALLEN IN IT
lbi-5694-64038-0011 BUT HOW TO GET HIM OUT WAS THE UNSOLVED PROBLEM
lbi-5694-64038-0012 THE POOR FELLOW STAYED IN THAT WELL ALL NIGHT
lbi-5694-64038-0013 WE LOOKED ALL AROUND AND THOUGHT THAT THE COAST WAS CLEAR
lbi-5694-64038-0014 I DON'T THINK HIS GUN WAS LOADED THOUGH BECAUSE WE DID NOT HEAR THE BALL WHISTLE
lbi-5694-64038-0015 WE WALKED OVER THIS FLOATING BRIDGE AND SOON FOUND OURSELVES ON THE TENNESSEE SIDE OF TENNESSEE RIVER
lbi-5694-64038-0016 WE HAD BEEF FOR SUPPER THAT NIGHT
lbi-5694-64038-0017 HOW EVERY PULSE DID BEAT AND LEAP AND HOW EVERY HEART DID THROB WITH EMOTIONS OF JOY WHICH SEEMED NEARLY AKIN TO HEAVEN WHEN WE RECEIVED THE GLAD INTELLIGENCE OF OUR ONWARD MARCH TOWARD THE LAND OF PROMISE AND OF OUR LOVED ONES
lbi-5694-64038-0018 WE WERE INURED TO PRIVATIONS AND HARDSHIPS HAD BEEN UPON EVERY MARCH IN EVERY BATTLE IN EVERY SKIRMISH IN EVERY ADVANCE IN EVERY RETREAT IN EVERY VICTORY IN EVERY DEFEAT
lbi-5694-64038-0019 HE WANTED TO GO BY HOME AND TELL HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN GOOD BYE AND TO GET HIS CLOTHES IT WAS NO GO
lbi-5694-64038-0020 BUT AFTER AWHILE JIM SAYS GENTLEMEN AY GANNY THE LAW
lbi-5694-64038-0021 YOU SEE JIM KNOWED THE LAW
lbi-5694-64038-0022 THOSE OLD SOLDIERS HAD LONG LONG AGO FORGOTTEN ABOUT THAT OLD LAW OF THE LONG GONE PAST BUT JIM HAD TREASURED IT UP IN HIS MEMORY LO THESE MANY YEARS AND HE THOUGHT IT WOULD SERVE HIM NOW AS IT HAD NO DOUBT FREQUENTLY DONE IN THE PAST
lbi-5694-64038-0023 THE THIRD DAY IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE YANKEES HAD TAKEN POSITION ON THE MURFREESBORO PIKE
lbi-5694-64038-0024 A REGIMENT WAS SENT TO THE ATTACK IT WAS JIM'S REGIMENT
lbi-5694-64038-0025 HE HADN'T SEEN ANYTHING TO SHOOT AT BUT HE BLAZED AWAY HE LOADED AND FIRED THE SECOND TIME WHEN THEY WERE ORDERED TO RETREAT
lbi-5895-34615-0000 BUT IS LAUGHTER A SYNONYM OF JOY
lbi-5895-34615-0001 SUCH PERFECT COMPLETENESS IS NOT IN NATURE
lbi-5895-34615-0002 HAD GWYNPLAINE WHEN A CHILD BEEN SO WORTHY OF ATTENTION THAT HIS FACE HAD BEEN SUBJECTED TO TRANSMUTATION WHY NOT
lbi-5895-34615-0003 ACCORDING TO ALL APPEARANCE INDUSTRIOUS MANIPULATORS OF CHILDREN HAD WORKED UPON HIS FACE
lbi-5895-34615-0004 IT SEEMED EVIDENT THAT A MYSTERIOUS AND PROBABLY OCCULT SCIENCE WHICH WAS TO SURGERY WHAT ALCHEMY WAS TO CHEMISTRY HAD CHISELLED HIS FLESH EVIDENTLY AT A VERY TENDER AGE AND MANUFACTURED HIS COUNTENANCE WITH PREMEDITATION
lbi-5895-34615-0005 GWYNPLAINE WAS A MOUNTEBANK
lbi-5895-34615-0006 HE SHOWED HIMSELF ON THE PLATFORM
lbi-5895-34615-0007 IT WAS GWYNPLAINE'S LAUGH WHICH CREATED THE LAUGHTER OF OTHERS YET HE DID NOT LAUGH HIMSELF
lbi-5895-34615-0008 THE OUTSIDE DID NOT DEPEND ON THE INTERIOR
lbi-5895-34615-0009 NO ONE COULD ESCAPE FROM THIS RICTUS
lbi-5895-34615-0010 ALL HIS EMOTIONS WHATEVER THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN AUGMENTED HIS STRANGE FACE OF JOY OR TO SPEAK MORE CORRECTLY AGGRAVATED IT
lbi-5895-34615-0011 AN EVERLASTING LAUGH
lbi-5895-34615-0012 THE MANICHAEANS BELIEVED THE ABSOLUTE OCCASIONALLY GIVES WAY AND THAT GOD HIMSELF SOMETIMES ABDICATES FOR A TIME SO ALSO OF THE WILL
lbi-5895-34615-0013 THE WHOLE OF EXISTENCE RESEMBLES A LETTER MODIFIED IN THE POSTSCRIPT
lbi-5895-34615-0014 WITH THIS EXCEPTION GWYNPLAINE'S LAUGH WAS EVERLASTING
lbi-5895-34615-0015 THE JOYOUS CONVULSION OF LAUGHTER WAS AS A TRIBUTE PAID THEY SUBMITTED TO IT GLADLY BUT ALMOST MECHANICALLY
lbi-5895-34615-0016 BESIDES WE MUST REMEMBER THAT THEY HAD IN THOSE TIMES MEANS OF PUTTING PATIENTS TO SLEEP AND OF SUPPRESSING ALL SUFFERING ONLY THEN IT WAS CALLED MAGIC WHILE NOW IT IS CALLED ANAESTHESIA
lbi-5895-34615-0017 BESIDES THIS FACE THOSE WHO HAD BROUGHT HIM UP HAD GIVEN HIM THE RESOURCES OF A GYMNAST AND AN ATHLETE
lbi-5895-34615-0018 GWYNPLAINE HAD YELLOW HAIR
lbi-5895-34615-0019 HIS HAIR HAVING PROBABLY BEEN DYED WITH SOME CORROSIVE PREPARATION HAD LEFT IT WOOLLY AND ROUGH TO THE TOUCH
lbi-5895-34615-0020 ITS YELLOW BRISTLES RATHER A MANE THAN A HEAD OF HAIR COVERED AND CONCEALED A LOFTY BROW EVIDENTLY MADE TO CONTAIN THOUGHT
lbi-5895-34615-0021 THE OPERATION WHATEVER IT HAD BEEN WHICH HAD DEPRIVED HIS FEATURES OF HARMONY AND PUT ALL THEIR FLESH INTO DISORDER HAD HAD NO EFFECT ON THE BONY STRUCTURE OF HIS HEAD
lbi-5895-34622-0000 WHAT TRUE THINGS ARE TOLD IN STORIES
lbi-5895-34622-0001 IN GWYNPLAINE EVIL THOUGHTS NEVER RIPENED AND HE HAD THEREFORE NO REMORSE
lbi-5895-34622-0002 WHAT WAS THIS NOTHING
lbi-5895-34622-0003 FROM SIXTEEN EIGHTY TO SEVENTEEN O FOUR A GREAT CHANGE HAD TAKEN PLACE
lbi-5895-34622-0004 THE WHEELS WERE ALL OF THE SAME SIZE AND HIGH AS WAGON WHEELS
lbi-5895-34622-0005 THIS GREEN COLOUR HAD SUCCEEDED IN DRAWING ATTENTION TO THE CARRIAGE WHICH WAS KNOWN IN ALL THE FAIR GROUNDS AS THE GREEN BOX
lbi-5895-34622-0006 ON THE ROOF FROM A TUBE PAINTED GREEN LIKE THE REST SMOKE AROSE
lbi-5895-34622-0007 THE ASTONISHMENT WITH WHICH THE VILLAGERS REGARDED THIS MACHINE WAS OVERWHELMING
lbi-5895-34622-0008 THIS WAS THE OLD ESTABLISHMENT OF URSUS ITS PROPORTIONS AUGMENTED BY SUCCESS AND IMPROVED FROM A WRETCHED BOOTH INTO A THEATRE
lbi-5895-34622-0009 UNKNOWN PEOPLE HAD WORKED UPON HIS FACE HE ON THE OTHER HAND HAD WORKED ON HIS MIND AND BEHIND THIS WELL EXECUTED MASK HE HAD PLACED ALL THAT HE COULD OF THOUGHT
lbi-5895-34622-0010 THE EFFECT OF HIS APPEARANCE HAD BEEN SURPRISING
lbi-5895-34622-0011 SOME BELIEVED IT TO BE NATURAL OTHERS DECLARED IT TO BE ARTIFICIAL AND AS CONJECTURE WAS ADDED TO REALITY EVERYWHERE AT EVERY CROSS ROAD ON THE JOURNEY IN ALL THE GROUNDS OF FAIRS AND FETES THE CROWD RAN AFTER GWYNPLAINE
lbi-5895-34622-0012 THE CURIOSITY OF ONE PLACE EXHAUSTED THEY PASSED ON TO ANOTHER
lbi-5895-34622-0013 THIS FORTUNE HAD ALLOWED URSUS WHO WAS THE ADMINISTRATOR OF GWYNPLAINE'S SUCCESS TO HAVE THE CHARIOT OF HIS DREAMS CONSTRUCTED THAT IS TO SAY A CARAVAN LARGE ENOUGH TO CARRY A THEATRE AND TO SOW SCIENCE AND ART IN THE HIGHWAYS
lbi-5895-34622-0014 FOR THESE READ FIBI AND VINOS THAT WE MAY CONFORM TO ENGLISH PRONUNCIATION
lbi-5895-34622-0015 PHOEBE COOKED VENUS SCRUBBED THE TEMPLE
lbi-5895-34622-0016 URSUS AND HOMO TOOK CHARGE OF EACH OTHER
lbi-5895-34622-0017 THIS HUT IN A CORNER AT THE BACK TO THE RIGHT OF THE DOOR SERVED AS BEDCHAMBER AND DRESSING ROOM TO URSUS AND GWYNPLAINE
lbi-5895-34622-0018 THE CARAVAN WAS DIVIDED INTO THREE COMPARTMENTS PARTITIONED FROM EACH OTHER
lbi-5895-34622-0019 A LOFT UNDER THE ARCH OF THE ROOF CONTAINED THE SCENES AND ON OPENING A TRAP DOOR LAMPS APPEARED PRODUCING WONDERS OF LIGHT
lbi-5895-34622-0020 URSUS WAS THE POET OF THESE MAGICAL REPRESENTATIONS HE WROTE THE PIECES
lbi-5895-34622-0021 THEN I LOOK PERHAPS LIKE WHAT I AM
lbi-5895-34622-0022 THIS OPENING LOOKED FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE A MOUTH OF HELL IN THE WORDS OF THE ITINERANT PURITAN PREACHERS WHO TURNED AWAY FROM IT WITH HORROR
lbi-5895-34622-0023 URSUS WAS IN EVERYTHING IN THE PIECE IN THE COMPANY IN THE KITCHEN IN THE ORCHESTRA
lbi-5895-34629-0000 IT WAS ESTABLISHED AT SOUTHWARK
lbi-5895-34629-0001 THE DOME OF SAINT PAUL'S WAS A DELIGHT TO URSUS
lbi-5895-34629-0002 SAINT PAUL IS A SAINT ONLY WITH EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES
lbi-5895-34629-0003 HE ENTERED HEAVEN ONLY BY THE ARTISTS DOOR
lbi-5895-34629-0004 IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN ORDERED FOR THE GREEN BOX
lbi-5895-34629-0005 IT WAS A THEATRE READY MADE
lbi-5895-34629-0006 AGAINST THIS WALL WAS PLACED THE GREEN BOX WHICH THEY WERE ABLE TO DRAW INTO THE YARD OWING TO THE HEIGHT OF THE GATE
lbi-5895-34629-0007 THE PLACARD GWYNPLAINE THE LAUGHING MAN TAKEN FROM ITS NAIL IN THE GREEN BOX WAS HUNG UP CLOSE TO THE SIGN OF THE INN
lbi-5895-34629-0008 BY THE SIDE OF THE DOOR WAS CONSTRUCTED OFF HAND BY MEANS OF AN EMPTY BARREL A BOX FOR THE MONEY TAKER WHO WAS SOMETIMES FIBI AND SOMETIMES VINOS
lbi-5895-34629-0009 WE ARE IN LONDON SAID URSUS WE MUST BE PREPARED FOR THE GENTRY
lbi-5895-34629-0010 THEY BEGAN THEIR PERFORMANCES
lbi-5895-34629-0011 WITH THAT EXCEPTION THEIR SUCCESS BECAME SO GREAT THAT NO MOUNTEBANK MEMORY COULD RECALL ITS PARALLEL
lbi-5895-34629-0012 ALL SOUTHWARK RAN IN CROWDS TO ADMIRE THE LAUGHING MAN
lbi-5895-34629-0013 THE MERRY ANDREWS AND MOUNTEBANKS OF TARRINZEAU FIELD WERE AGHAST AT GWYNPLAINE
lbi-5895-34629-0014 GWYNPLAINE ATE UP THEIR PUBLIC
lbi-5895-34629-0015 BESIDES THE SMALL FRY THE SWALLOWERS OF SWORDS AND THE GRIMACE MAKERS REAL PERFORMANCES TOOK PLACE ON THE GREEN
lbi-5895-34629-0016 EVEN THIS COMEDIAN OF JAWS AND CLAWS WAS ECLIPSED IN SUCCESS
lbi-5895-34629-0017 THAT SUCCESS WAS PRODIGIOUS STILL IT REMAINED LOCAL
lbi-5895-34629-0018 IT TOOK A HUNDRED AND THIRTY YEARS FOR THE NAME OF SHAKESPEARE TO PENETRATE FROM ENGLAND INTO FRANCE
lbi-5895-34629-0019 THE GLORY OF GWYNPLAINE HAD NOT PASSED LONDON BRIDGE
lbi-5895-34629-0020 THESE WERE REMARKABLE TALENTS
lbi-5895-34629-0021 BESIDES THIS HE HARANGUED LIKE CICERO AS WE HAVE JUST SEEN SOLD HIS DRUGS ATTENDED SICKNESS AND EVEN HEALED THE SICK
lbi-5895-34629-0022 URSUS WAS SATISFIED WITH THE APPLAUSE OF SOUTHWARK BUT BY NO MEANS ASTONISHED
lbi-5895-34629-0023 AT EVERY PERFORMANCE THE YARD OF THE INN TRANSFORMED INTO A PIT WAS FILLED WITH A RAGGED AND ENTHUSIASTIC AUDIENCE
lbi-5895-34629-0024 THE EMPTYING OF TANKARDS DID NOT DECREASE THEIR SUCCESS
lbi-5895-34629-0025 THIS CONNOISSEUR WAS SUDDENLY FASCINATED AND HAD ADOPTED THE LAUGHING MAN
lbi-5895-34629-0026 HE DID NOT COME EVERY EVENING BUT WHEN HE CAME HE LED THE PUBLIC APPLAUSE GREW INTO ACCLAMATION SUCCESS ROSE NOT TO THE ROOF FOR THERE WAS NONE BUT TO THE CLOUDS FOR THERE WERE PLENTY OF THEM
lbi-5895-34629-0027 WHICH CLOUDS SEEING THAT THERE WAS NO ROOF SOMETIMES WEPT OVER THE MASTERPIECE OF URSUS
lbi-5895-34629-0028 HIS ENTHUSIASM CAUSED URSUS TO REMARK THIS MAN AND GWYNPLAINE TO OBSERVE HIM
lbi-5895-34629-0029 THEY HAD A GREAT FRIEND IN THIS UNKNOWN VISITOR
lbi-5895-34629-0030 ONE EVENING URSUS WAS IN THE SIDE SCENE WHICH WAS THE KITCHEN DOOR OF THE GREEN BOX SEEING MASTER NICLESS STANDING BY HIM SHOWED HIM THIS MAN IN THE CROWD AND ASKED HIM
lbi-5895-34629-0031 WHAT A PITY THAT HE SHOULD NOT BE A LORD
lbi-5895-34629-0032 HE WOULD MAKE A FAMOUS SCOUNDREL
lbi-5895-34629-0033 AT THAT HOUR THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE FAIR GROUND EXCEPT PERHAPS SOME REELING DRUNKARD MAKING STAGGERING SHADOWS IN DARK CORNERS
lbi-6241-61943-0000 ON THE SECOND OF THE MONTH AT TWO IN THE MORNING OUR PRECIOUS CARGO OF LUGGAGE WAS TAKEN ON BOARD THE GOOD SHIP VALKYRIE
lbi-6241-61943-0001 BUT IN THE CAUSE OF SCIENCE MEN ARE EXPECTED TO SUFFER
lbi-6241-61943-0002 WELL AND HAVE WE A FAIR WIND
lbi-6241-61943-0003 MY UNCLE WAS DELIGHTED FOR MYSELF MOODY AND DISSATISFIED I APPEARED ALMOST TO EXPECT A GLIMPSE OF THE GHOST OF HAMLET
lbi-6241-61943-0004 BUT NO GHOST OR ANYTHING ELSE APPEARED UPON THE ANCIENT WALLS
lbi-6241-61943-0005 THE FACT IS THE CASTLE IS MUCH LATER THAN THE TIME OF THE HEROIC PRINCE OF DENMARK
lbi-6241-61943-0006 NO MISTER HARDWIGG SAID THE CAPTAIN NO FEAR OF THAT
lbi-6241-61943-0007 AT ALL EVENTS WE SHALL GET THERE SOME DAY
lbi-6241-61943-0008 ON THE ELEVENTH DAY WE SIGHTED CAPE PORTLAND OVER WHICH TOWERED MOUNT MYRDALS YOKUL WHICH THE WEATHER BEING CLEAR WE MADE OUT VERY READILY
lbi-6241-61943-0009 THE VALKYRIE KEPT OFF THE COAST STEERING TO THE WESTWARD
lbi-6241-61943-0010 ON ALL SIDES WERE TO BE SEEN WHOLE SCHOOLS OF WHALES AND SHARKS
lbi-6241-61943-0011 NEARLY THE WHOLE POPULATION OF THE TOWN WAS ON FOOT TO SEE US LAND
lbi-6241-61943-0012 THE FACT WAS THAT SCARCELY ANY ONE OF THEM BUT EXPECTED SOME GOODS BY THE PERIODICAL VESSEL
lbi-6241-61943-0013 THEN WITHOUT FURTHER REMARK HE PUT HIS FINGER TO HIS LIPS FROWNED DARKLY AND DESCENDED INTO THE SMALL BOAT WHICH AWAITED US
lbi-6241-61943-0014 HE WAS HOWEVER BUT A CIVIL SERVANT A MAGISTRATE THE GOVERNOR OF THE ISLAND BARON TRAMPE
lbi-6241-61943-0015 THE PROFESSOR KNEW WHOM HE HAD TO DEAL WITH
lbi-6241-61943-0016 THIS MODEST SCHOLAR SPOKE NO LANGUAGES SAVE ICELANDIC AND LATIN
lbi-6241-61943-0017 WHEN THEREFORE HE ADDRESSED HIMSELF TO ME IN THE LANGUAGE OF HORACE WE AT ONCE CAME TO UNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER
lbi-6241-61943-0018 NOW HARRY SAID MY UNCLE RUBBING HIS HANDS AN GOES WELL THE WORSE DIFFICULTY IS NOW OVER
lbi-6241-61943-0019 IN THE MEANTIME THERE IS NOT AN HOUR TO LOSE
lbi-6241-61943-0020 VERY LIKELY I MAY FIND THERE SOME MANUSCRIPTS FROM THE HAND OF SAKNUSSEMM
lbi-6241-61943-0021 I SHALL BE GLAD TO CONSULT THEM
lbi-6241-61943-0022 THEY WERE NOW HOWEVER ABSENT ON DUTY
lbi-6241-61943-0023 THOUGH NOT VERY LARGE IT APPEARED NOT LIKELY TO BE FILLED FOR CENTURIES
lbi-6241-61943-0024 I HAVE NOT THE SLIGHTEST DOUBT THAT IN HIGH WINDS ITS RED TILES WERE BLOWN OUT TO THE GREAT ANNOYANCE OF THE PASTOR AND CONGREGATION
lbi-6241-61943-0025 THANKS TO THE HEAT OF THESE RESIDENCES GRASS GROWS ON THE ROOF WHICH GRASS IS CAREFULLY CUT FOR HAY
lbi-6241-61943-0026 I SAW BUT FEW INHABITANTS DURING MY EXCURSION BUT I MET A CROWD ON THE BEACH DRYING SALTING AND LOADING CODFISH THE PRINCIPAL ARTICLE OF EXPORTATION
lbi-6241-61943-0027 THE MEN APPEARED ROBUST BUT HEAVY FAIR HAIRED LIKE GERMANS BUT OF PENSIVE MIEN EXILES OF A HIGHER SCALE IN THE LADDER OF HUMANITY THAN THE ESKIMOS BUT I THOUGHT MUCH MORE UNHAPPY SINCE WITH SUPERIOR PERCEPTIONS THEY ARE COMPELLED TO LIVE WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE POLAR CIRCLE
lbi-6241-61946-0000 I BEGAN TO ENJOY THE EXHILARATING DELIGHT OF TRAVELING A LIFE OF DESIRE GRATIFICATION AND LIBERTY
lbi-6241-61946-0001 HANS OUR EXTRAORDINARY GUIDE WENT FIRST WALKING WITH A STEADY RAPID UNVARYING STEP
lbi-6241-61946-0002 OUR TWO HORSES WITH THE LUGGAGE FOLLOWED OF THEIR OWN ACCORD WITHOUT REQUIRING WHIP OR SPUR
lbi-6241-61946-0003 GEOGRAPHERS HAVE DIVIDED IT INTO FOUR PARTS AND WE HAD TO CROSS THE SOUTHWEST QUARTER WHICH IN THE VERNACULAR IS CALLED SUDVESTR FJORDUNGR
lbi-6241-61946-0004 WE TOOK OUR WAY THROUGH POOR AND SPARSE MEADOWS WHICH MADE A DESPERATE EFFORT EVERY YEAR TO SHOW A LITTLE GREEN
lbi-6241-61946-0005 THEY VERY RARELY SUCCEED IN A GOOD SHOW OF YELLOW
lbi-6241-61946-0006 I COULD NOT HELP SMILING TO SEE HIM LOOK SO BIG ON HIS LITTLE HORSE HIS LONG LEGS NOW AND THEN TOUCHING THE GROUND MADE HIM LOOK LIKE A SIX FOOTED CENTAUR
lbi-6241-61946-0007 SNOW TEMPEST IMPRACTICABLE ROADS ROCKS ICEBERGS NOTHING STOPS HIM
lbi-6241-61946-0008 WE MAY DO SO WAS MY REPLY BUT WHAT ABOUT OUR WORTHY GUIDE
lbi-6241-61946-0009 I SHOULD HAVE A VIOLENT ATTACK OF THE CRAMP IF I WERE NOT TO HAVE SOME SORT OF EXERCISE
lbi-6241-61946-0010 MY ARMS ARE RIGHT BUT MY LEGS ARE GETTING A LITTLE STIFF
lbi-6241-61946-0011 HERE AND THERE COULD BE SEEN AN ISOLATED FARM SOME SOLITARY BUR OR ICELANDIC HOUSE BUILT OF WOOD EARTH FRAGMENTS OF LAVA LOOKING LIKE BEGGARS ON THE HIGHWAY OF LIFE
lbi-6241-61946-0012 A FEW STRAY COWS AND SHEEP WERE ONLY SEEN OCCASIONALLY
lbi-6241-61946-0013 LITTLE DID I EXPECT HOWEVER THE SPECTACLE WHICH AWAITED US WHEN WE REACHED THE PENINSULA OF SNEFFELS WHERE AGGLOMERATIONS OF NATURE'S RUINS FORM A KIND OF TERRIBLE CHAOS
lbi-6241-61946-0014 IT CONSISTS SIMPLY OF A FEW HOUSES NOT WHAT IN ENGLAND OR GERMANY WE SHOULD CALL A HAMLET
lbi-6241-61946-0015 I TOOK OCCASION TO CONSULT THE MAP TO SEE WHERE GARDAR WAS TO BE FOUND
lbi-6241-61946-0016 THESE SACRED EDIFICES ARE HOWEVER VERY MUCH LIKE THESE PEOPLE WHO DO WITHOUT WATCHES AND NEVER MISS THEM
lbi-6241-61946-0017 TO RIDE OVER SALT WATER UPON THE BACK OF A LITTLE HORSE SEEMED TO ME ABSURD
lbi-6241-61946-0018 IN ANY CASE I SHALL TRUST RATHER TO MY OWN INTELLIGENCE THAN THEIRS
lbi-6241-61946-0019 BUT MY UNCLE WAS IN NO HUMOR TO WAIT
lbi-6241-61946-0020 AT LENGTH THE STURDY LITTLE PONY SPREADING OUT HIS LEGS IN A STIFF AND LUDICROUS ATTITUDE GOT FROM UNDER THE PROFESSOR'S LEGS AND LEFT HIM STANDING WITH BOTH FEET ON A SEPARATE STONE LIKE THE COLOSSUS OF RHODES
lbi-6241-61946-0021 HE SAYS TIDE REPLIED MY UNCLE TRANSLATING THE DANISH WORD FOR MY INFORMATION
lbi-6241-61946-0022 I THOROUGHLY UNDERSTOOD AND APPRECIATED THE NECESSITY FOR WAITING BEFORE CROSSING THE FJORD FOR THAT MOMENT WHEN THE SEA AT ITS HIGHEST POINT IS IN A STATE OF SLACK WATER
lbi-6241-61946-0023 ACCUSTOMED AS I HAD BEEN TO THE STEAM FERRY BOATS OF THE ELBE I FOUND THE LONG OARS OF THE BOATMEN BUT SORRY MEANS OF LOCOMOTION
lbi-6241-66616-0000 BUT THIS POWER OF DISCERNMENT WAS DENIED THEM AND ONLY IN AFTER YEARS WITH THE LOVED ONES OF THEIR OWN FIRESIDES CLOSE ABOUT THEM WAS THE WHOLE PICTURE REVEALED
lbi-6241-66616-0001 ONE DARK NIGHT AT THE HEAD OF A SCORE OF HIS TRIBE HE FELL UPON WABIGOON'S CAMP HIS OBJECT BEING THE ABDUCTION OF THE PRINCESS
lbi-6241-66616-0002 WHILE THE ATTACK WAS SUCCESSFUL IN A WAY ITS MAIN PURPOSE FAILED
lbi-6241-66616-0003 A COUNTER ATTACK WAS MADE UPON WOONGA AND HE WAS DRIVEN DEEP INTO THE WILDERNESS WITH GREAT LOSS
lbi-6241-66616-0004 THREE DAYS LATER MINNETAKI BECAME NEWSOME'S WIFE AT THE HUDSON BAY POST
lbi-6241-66616-0005 FROM THAT HOUR DATED ONE OF THE MOST SANGUINARY FEUDS IN THE HISTORY OF THE GREAT TRADING COMPANY A FEUD WHICH AS WE SHALL SEE WAS DESTINED TO LIVE EVEN UNTO THE SECOND GENERATION
lbi-6241-66616-0006 MEANWHILE TWO CHILDREN CAME TO BLESS THE HAPPY UNION OF NEWSOME AND HIS LOVELY INDIAN WIFE
lbi-6241-66616-0007 THE OTHER WAS A GIRL THREE YEARS YOUNGER AND NEWSOME INSISTED THAT SHE BE CALLED MINNETAKI
lbi-6241-66616-0008 CURIOUSLY ENOUGH THE BLOOD OF WABI RAN ALMOST PURE TO HIS INDIAN FOREFATHERS WHILE MINNETAKI AS SHE BECAME OLDER DEVELOPED LESS OF THE WILD BEAUTY OF HER MOTHER AND MORE OF THE SOFTER LOVELINESS OF THE WHITE RACE HER WEALTH OF SOFT JET BLACK HAIR AND HER GREAT DARK EYES CONTRASTING WITH THE LIGHTER SKIN OF HER FATHER'S BLOOD
lbi-6241-66616-0009 WABI ON THE OTHER HAND WAS AN INDIAN IN APPEARANCE FROM HIS MOCCASINS TO THE CROWN OF HIS HEAD SWARTHY SINEWY AS AGILE AS A LYNX AND WITH EVERY INSTINCT IN HIM CRYING FOR THE LIFE OF THE WILD
lbi-6241-66616-0010 ONE OF NEWSOME'S CHIEF PLEASURES IN LIFE HAD BEEN THE EDUCATING OF HIS WOODLAND BRIDE AND IT WAS THE AMBITION OF BOTH THAT THE LITTLE MINNETAKI AND HER BROTHER BE REARED IN THE WAYS OF WHITE CHILDREN
lbi-6241-66616-0011 CONSEQUENTLY BOTH MOTHER AND FATHER BEGAN THEIR EDUCATION AT THE POST THEY WERE SENT TO THE FACTOR'S SCHOOL AND TWO WINTERS WERE PASSED IN PORT ARTHUR THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF THOROUGHLY EQUIPPED SCHOOLS
lbi-6241-66616-0012 THE CHILDREN PROVED THEMSELVES UNUSUALLY BRIGHT PUPILS AND BY THE TIME WABI WAS SIXTEEN AND MINNETAKI TWELVE ONE WOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN FROM THEIR MANNER OF SPEECH THAT INDIAN BLOOD RAN IN THEIR VEINS
lbi-6241-66616-0013 IT WAS AT ABOUT THIS TIME IN THEIR LIVES THAT THE WOONGAS BECAME ESPECIALLY DARING IN THEIR DEPREDATIONS
lbi-6241-66616-0014 AT LAST SO DARING DID HE BECOME THAT THE PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT PLACED A PRICE UPON HIS HEAD AND UPON THOSE OF A NUMBER OF HIS MOST NOTORIOUS FOLLOWERS
lbi-6241-66616-0015 BUT EACH WEEK ADDED TO HIS LONELINESS AND HIS LONGINGS FOR MINNETAKI AND HIS FORESTS
lbi-6241-66616-0016 NECESSITY HAD BECOME HIS GRIM MASTER AND THE FOLLOWING WEEK HE WAS GOING TO WORK
lbi-6241-66616-0017 A THOUSAND PLANS WERE MADE A THOUSAND ADVENTURES PICTURED AND THE MOTHER WOULD SMILE AND LAUGH AND PLAN WITH THEM
lbi-6241-66616-0018 BUT IN TIME THE END OF IT ALL CAME AND WABI WENT BACK TO THE PRINCESS MOTHER TO MINNETAKI AND TO HIS FORESTS
lbi-6241-66616-0019 THERE WERE TEARS IN THE BOYS EYES WHEN THEY PARTED AND THE MOTHER CRIED FOR THE INDIAN BOY WHO WAS RETURNING TO HIS PEOPLE
lbi-6241-66616-0020 SPRING CAME AND PASSED AND THEN SUMMER
lbi-6241-66616-0021 WE SHALL MAKE MORE MONEY UP HERE THIS WINTER THAN YOU COULD EARN IN DETROIT IN THREE YEARS
lbi-6241-66616-0022 WE WILL HUNT WOLVES THE COUNTRY IS ALIVE WITH THEM AND THE GOVERNMENT GIVES A BOUNTY OF FIFTEEN DOLLARS FOR EVERY SCALP TAKEN
lbi-6241-66616-0023 THREE WEEKS LATER CAME WABIGOON'S REPLY
lbi-6241-66616-0024 ON THE TENTH OF OCTOBER HE WOULD MEET ROD AT SPRUCEWOOD ON THE BLACK STURGEON RIVER
lbi-6241-66616-0025 THERE WAS LITTLE TIME TO LOSE IN MAKING PREPARATIONS AND THE FOURTH DAY FOLLOWING THE RECEIPT OF WABI'S LETTER FOUND ROD AND HIS MOTHER WAITING FOR THE TRAIN WHICH WAS TO WHIRL THE BOY INTO HIS NEW LIFE
lbi-6295-244435-0000 CHAPTER SEVEN THE HOMECOMING
lbi-6295-244435-0001 COLONEL LEONIDAS TALBOT REGARDED THE WHITE FLAG WITH FEELINGS IN WHICH TRIUMPH AND SADNESS WERE MINGLED STRANGELY
lbi-6295-244435-0002 BUT THE EMOTIONS OF HARRY AND HIS COMRADES WERE FOR THE MOMENT THOSE OF VICTORY ONLY
lbi-6295-244435-0003 BOATS PUT OUT BOTH FROM THE FORT AND THE SHORE
lbi-6295-244435-0004 THE SMOKE ITSELF WHICH HAD FORMED A VAST CLOUD OVER HARBOR FORTS AND CITY WAS NOW DRIFTING OUT TO SEA LEAVING ALL THINGS ETCHED SHARPLY IN THE DAZZLING SUNLIGHT OF A SOUTHERN SPRING DAY
lbi-6295-244435-0005 THAT WHITE FLAG AND THOSE BOATS GOING OUT MEAN THAT SUMTER IS OURS
lbi-6295-244435-0006 BUT THE NEGOTIATIONS WERE SOON COMPLETED
lbi-6295-244435-0007 ALL THE AMENITIES WERE PRESERVED BETWEEN THE CAPTURED GARRISON AND THEIR CAPTORS
lbi-6295-244435-0008 THE GREAT STATE OF VIRGINIA MOTHER OF PRESIDENTS WENT OUT OF THE UNION AT LAST AND NORTH CAROLINA TENNESSEE AND ARKANSAS FOLLOWED HER BUT MARYLAND KENTUCKY AND MISSOURI STILL HUNG IN THE BALANCE
lbi-6295-244435-0009 LINCOLN HAD CALLED FOR VOLUNTEERS TO PUT DOWN A REBELLION BUT HARRY HEARD EVERYWHERE IN CHARLESTON THAT THE CONFEDERACY WAS NOW SECURE
lbi-6295-244435-0010 THE PROGRESS OF PRESIDENT DAVIS TO THE NEW CAPITAL SET IN THE VERY FACE OF THE FOE WAS TO BE ONE HUGE TRIUMPH OF FAITH AND LOYALTY
lbi-6295-244435-0011 THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE NOTE OF GLOOM
lbi-6295-244435-0012 EUROPE WHICH MUST HAVE ITS COTTON WOULD FAVOR THE SUCCESS OF THE SOUTH
lbi-6295-244435-0013 AN EXTRAORDINARY WAVE OF EMOTION SWEPT OVER THE SOUTH CARRYING EVERYBODY WITH IT
lbi-6295-244435-0014 BEAUREGARD AT ONCE WROTE AN ORDER
lbi-6295-244435-0015 COLONEL KENTON WRITES WISELY
lbi-6295-244435-0016 WE NEED KENTUCKY AND I UNDERSTAND THAT A VERY LITTLE MORE MAY BRING THE STATE TO US GO WITH YOUR FATHER I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE BEEN A BRAVE YOUNG SOLDIER HERE AND MAY YOU DO AS WELL UP THERE
lbi-6295-244435-0017 HARRY FEELING PRIDE BUT NOT SHOWING IT SALUTED AND LEFT THE ROOM GOING AT ONCE TO MADAME DELAUNAY'S WHERE HE HAD LEFT HIS BAGGAGE
lbi-6295-244435-0018 HE INTENDED TO LEAVE EARLY IN THE MORNING BUT FIRST HE SOUGHT HIS FRIENDS AND TOLD THEM GOOD BYE
lbi-6295-244435-0019 HARRY GAVE HIS FAREWELLS WITH DEEP AND GENUINE REGRET
lbi-6295-244435-0020 WHETHER THEIR MANNER WAS GRAVE OR FRIVOLOUS HE KNEW THAT THESE WERE GOOD FRIENDS OF HIS AND HE SINCERELY HOPED THAT HE WOULD MEET THEM AGAIN
lbi-6295-244435-0021 IT WAS A DIFFERENT HARRY WHO STARTED HOME LATE IN APRIL
lbi-6295-244435-0022 FOUR MONTHS HAD MADE GREAT CHANGES HE BORE HIMSELF MORE LIKE A MAN HIS MANNER WAS MUCH MORE CONSIDERED AND GRAVE
lbi-6295-244435-0023 HE HAD SEEN GREAT THINGS AND HE HAD DONE HIS SHARE OF THEM
lbi-6295-244435-0024 HE GAZED UPON A WORLD FULL OF RESPONSIBILITIES AND PERILS
lbi-6295-244435-0025 BUT HE LOOKED BACK AT CHARLESTON THE GAY THE VOLATILE AND THE BEAUTIFUL WITH REAL AFFECTION
lbi-6295-244435-0026 IT WAS ALMOST BURIED NOW IN FLOWERS AND FOLIAGE
lbi-6295-244435-0027 HE WAS GOING HOME AFTER VICTORY
lbi-6295-244435-0028 HE SOON LEFT CHARLESTON OUT OF SIGHT
lbi-6295-244435-0029 HE FELT THE DIFFERENCE AS SOON AS HE REACHED THE HILLS OF HIS NATIVE STATE
lbi-6295-244435-0030 PEOPLE WERE COOLER HERE AND THEY WERE MORE PRONE TO LOOK AT THE TWO SIDES OF A QUESTION
lbi-6295-244435-0031 THE AIR TOO WAS UNLIKE THAT OF SOUTH CAROLINA THERE WAS A SHARPER TANG TO IT
lbi-6295-244435-0032 IT WHIPPED HIS BLOOD AS IT BLEW DOWN FROM THE SLOPES AND CRESTS
lbi-6295-244435-0033 IT WAS AFTERNOON WHEN HE REACHED THE LITTLE STATION OF WINTON AND LEFT THE TRAIN A TALL STURDY BOY THE SUPERIOR OF MANY A MAN IN SIZE STRENGTH AND AGILITY
lbi-6295-244435-0034 THERE WERE NEVER BEFORE SUCH TIMES IN OLD KENTUCKY
lbi-6295-244435-0035 BILL SKELLY AN HIS GANG THEM MOUNTAINEERS ARE UP
lbi-6295-244435-0036 HE DID NOT SAY THE LAST AS A BOAST BUT MERELY AS AN ASSURANCE TO THE LIVERYMAN WHO HE SAW WAS ANXIOUS ON HIS ACCOUNT
lbi-6295-244435-0037 IF YOU'VE GOT PISTOLS JUST YOU THINK ONCE BEFORE YOU SHOOT SAID COLLINS
lbi-6295-244435-0038 HARRY THANKED HIM THREW HIS SADDLE BAGS ACROSS THE HORSE A POWERFUL BAY AND GIVING A FINAL WAVE OF HIS HAND TO THE SYMPATHETIC LIVERYMAN RODE AWAY
lbi-6295-244435-0039 THIS WAS NOT THE FASHION OF A YEAR AGO WHEN THEY EXCHANGED A FRIENDLY WORD OR TWO BUT HARRY KNEW ITS CAUSE NOW NOBODY COULD TRUST ANYBODY ELSE
lbi-6295-244435-0040 BUT HE SAW NOTHING THAT MOVED THERE NO SIGNAL LIGHTS TWINKLED
