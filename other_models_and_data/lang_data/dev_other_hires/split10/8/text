lbi-6455-67804-0028 BAROLD STOOD GNAWING HIS MUSTACHE AND MADE NO REPLY HE WAS NOT VERY COMFORTABLE
lbi-6455-67804-0029 HE FELT HIMSELF ILL USED BY FATE AND RATHER WISHED HE HAD RETURNED TO LONDON FROM BROADOAKS INSTEAD OF LOITERING IN SLOWBRIDGE
lbi-6455-67804-0030 HE HAD AMUSED HIMSELF AT FIRST BUT IN TIME HE HAD BEEN SURPRISED TO FIND HIS AMUSEMENT LOSE SOMETHING OF ITS ZEST
lbi-6455-67804-0031 IT'S DEUCEDLY BAD FORM ON HIS PART HE SAID MENTALLY WHAT DOES HE MEAN BY IT

lbi-6455-67804-0039 SHE BEGAN TO MOVE THE MANACLES ON HER RIGHT WRIST
lbi-6455-67804-0040 SHE HAD NOT BROUGHT LUCIA UP UNDER HER OWN EYE FOR NOTHING
lbi-6467-56885-0000 HIS BODY WAS LONG AND SLENDER HARD AND AGILE HIS SIGHT KEEN HIS AIM UNERRING
lbi-6467-56885-0001 IN THE MONTH OF AGRAHAYAN KANTI HAD GONE OUT SHOOTING NEAR THE SWAMP OF NYDIGHI WITH A FEW SPORTING COMPANIONS
lbi-6467-56885-0002 ONE MORNING AS KANTI WAS SEATED IN HIS BOAT CLEANING A FAVOURITE GUN HE SUDDENLY STARTED AT WHAT HE THOUGHT WAS THE CRY OF WILD DUCK LOOKING UP HE SAW A VILLAGE MAIDEN COMING TO THE WATER'S EDGE WITH TWO WHITE DUCKLINGS CLASPED TO HER BREAST
lbi-6467-56885-0003 THE GIRL PUT THE BIRDS INTO THE WATER AND WATCHED THEM ANXIOUSLY
lbi-6467-56885-0004 LOOKING ROUND KANTI SAW ONE OF HIS MEN POINTING AN UNLOADED GUN AT THE DUCKS
lbi-6467-56885-0005 KANTI WENT ON CLEANING HIS GUN
lbi-6467-56885-0006 AFTER KANTI HAD EATEN AND DRUNK THE BRAHMIN BEGGED HIM TO INTRODUCE HIMSELF KANTI GAVE HIS OWN NAME HIS FATHER'S NAME AND THE ADDRESS OF HIS HOME AND THEN SAID IN THE USUAL WAY IF I CAN BE OF ANY SERVICE SIR I SHALL DEEM MYSELF FORTUNATE
lbi-6467-56885-0007 SO SAYING KANTI REPEATED HIS SALUTE AND WENT BACK
lbi-6467-56885-0008 THE BRICK BUILT MANSION OF THE MAZUMDARS HAD BEEN BORROWED FOR THE WEDDING CEREMONY WHICH WAS FIXED FOR NEXT MAGH AS KANTI DID NOT WISH TO DELAY
lbi-6467-56885-0009 IN DUE TIME THE BRIDEGROOM ARRIVED ON HIS ELEPHANT WITH DRUMS AND MUSIC AND WITH A TORCHLIGHT PROCESSION AND THE CEREMONY BEGAN
lbi-6467-56885-0010 IN THAT BASHFUL DOWNCAST FACE CROWNED WITH THE WEDDING CORONET AND BEDECKED WITH SANDAL PASTE HE COULD SCARCELY RECOGNISE THE VILLAGE MAIDEN OF HIS FANCY AND IN THE FULNESS OF HIS EMOTION A MIST SEEMED TO BECLOUD HIS EYES
lbi-6467-56885-0011 THE LIGHT OF THE LAMPS SEEMED TO GROW DIM AND DARKNESS TO TARNISH THE FACE OF THE BRIDE HERSELF

lbi-6467-56885-0016 THE INCREASING LAUGHTER IN THE ROOM BETOKENED AN AMUSING JOKE
lbi-6467-56885-0017 WITH A SIGH OF INTENSE RELIEF AS OF ESCAPE FROM CALAMITY HE LOOKED ONCE MORE INTO THE FACE OF HIS BRIDE

lbi-6467-94831-0045 OH YOU CAN'T JOKE ME NO MORE
lbi-6467-97061-0000 ONE NIGHT WHEN BOTH WERE SLEEPING THE PRINCE HAD A REMARKABLE DREAM
lbi-6467-97061-0001 THEY RUSHED INTO THE ROOM ADDED THEIR CRIES TO HERS AND FORGETTING ALL THEIR FORMER PRECAUTIONS LEFT THE DOORS OPEN SO THAT THE GUARDS OUTSIDE HEARING THE CLAMOUR ENTERED AND SAW THE PRINCE
lbi-6467-97061-0002 SHE IS A DISGRACE TO HER FAMILY AND SHALL SOON SEE HER HUSBAND IMPALED ON A STAKE
lbi-6467-97061-0003 THEN WITH HIS FOREHEAD DISFIGURED BY A FEARFUL FROWN HE CONTINUED TO ABUSE THE PRINCE AND HAVING TIED HIS HANDS BEHIND HIM DRAGGED HIM FROM THE ROOM
lbi-6467-97061-0004 TREATED THUS LIKE SOME WILD BEAST ROUGHLY SHAKEN AND NEGLECTED RAJAVAHANA WOULD HAVE SUFFERED GREATLY HAD HE NOT BEEN PROTECTED BY THE MAGIC JEWEL GIVEN TO HIM IN PATALA AND WHICH HE HAD CONTRIVED TO CONCEAL IN HIS HAIR
lbi-6467-97061-0005 ADVANCING THEREFORE WITH A LARGE ARMY HE PREPARED TO BESIEGE CHAMPA THE CAPITAL CITY
lbi-6467-97061-0006 A TERRIBLE BATTLE ENSUED IN WHICH BOTH KINGS PERFORMED PRODIGIES OF VALOUR
lbi-6467-97061-0007 SHOULD THERE BE ANY PITY FOR THE VIOLATOR OF THE HAREM
lbi-6467-97061-0008 IF THE OLD KING MY FATHER NOW IN HIS DOTAGE WAS FOOLISH ENOUGH TO FAVOUR THE CRIMINAL FOR THE SAKE OF HIS WORTHLESS DAUGHTER YOU HAD NO NEED OF HIS PERMISSION AND OUGHT NOT TO HAVE BEEN INFLUENCED BY HIM
lbi-6467-97061-0009 LET THAT VILE SEDUCER BE IMMEDIATELY PUT TO DEATH BY TORTURE AND HIS PARAMOUR BE SHUT UP IN PRISON TILL I COME
lbi-6467-97061-0010 HAVE READY ALSO A FIERCE ELEPHANT SUITABLY EQUIPPED WHICH I SHALL MOUNT IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE WEDDING TO OVERTAKE MY ARMY IN MARCH AGAINST THE ENEMY AND AS I SET OUT I WILL MAKE THE ELEPHANT TRAMPLE THE LIFE OUT OF THAT CRIMINAL
lbi-6467-97061-0011 WHILE HE STOOD THERE CALMLY AWAITING DEATH WHICH NOW SEEMED INEVITABLE HE SUDDENLY FELT HIS FEET FREE AND A BEAUTIFUL LADY APPEARED BEFORE HIM
lbi-6467-97061-0012 SHE HUMBLY BOWING DOWN SAID LET MY LORD PARDON HIS SERVANT FOR THE INJURY WHICH SHE HAS UNCONSCIOUSLY CAUSED
lbi-6467-97061-0013 I AM AN APSARAS BORN FROM THE RAYS OF THE MOON
lbi-6467-97061-0014 ONE DAY AS I WAS FLYING THROUGH THE AIR WEARING A WHITE DRESS A SWAN MISTAKING ME FOR A LOTUS FLOWER ATTACKED ME
lbi-6467-97061-0015 IN HIS ANGER HE CURSED ME SAYING O WICKED ONE FOR THIS OFFENCE YOU ARE CONDEMNED TO BE CHANGED INTO A PIECE OF UNCONSCIOUS METAL
lbi-6467-97061-0016 THE CHANGE TOOK PLACE IMMEDIATELY AND I FELL TO THE GROUND TURNED INTO A SILVER CHAIN
lbi-6467-97061-0017 ON HIS WAY HE SAW THE SILVER FETTER DESCENDED TO THE GROUND PICKED IT UP AND CONTINUED HIS FLIGHT
lbi-6467-97061-0018 THE SLAYER OF CHANDAVARMA HEARING THIS CAME OUT OF THE PALACE AND QUICKLY MOUNTING THE ELEPHANT WHO HELD DOWN HIS TRUNK TO RECEIVE HIM PLACED HIMSELF BEHIND THE PRINCE
lbi-6467-97061-0019 GREAT WAS THEIR MUTUAL ASTONISHMENT AND JOY WHEN THEY RECOGNISED EACH OTHER THE PRINCE EXCLAIMING IS IT POSSIBLE
lbi-6467-97061-0020 IS IT REALLY YOU MY DEAR FRIEND APAHARAVARMA WHO HAVE DONE THIS DEED
lbi-6467-97061-0021 THROUGH THESE THEY FORCED THEIR WAY EMPLOYING WITH GOOD EFFECT THE WEAPONS PLACED ON THE ELEPHANT FOR THE USE OF CHANDAVARMA
lbi-6467-97061-0022 BEFORE HOWEVER THEY HAD GONE FAR THEY HEARD THE NOISE OF BATTLE AT A DISTANCE AND SAW THE SOLDIERS IN FRONT OF THEM SCATTERED IN ALL DIRECTIONS
lbi-6467-97061-0023 WE HAVE JUST NOW ENCOUNTERED AND UTTERLY DEFEATED THE ENEMY SO THAT THERE IS NO FEAR OF ANY FURTHER RESISTANCE
lbi-6467-97061-0024 RAJAVAHANA AGREED TO THIS
lbi-6599-38590-0000 WHATEVER HAND IT WAS THAT SHOT DOWN BOURBON ROME AFTER HIS DEATH WAS PLUNDERED DEVASTATED AND RAVAGED BY A BRUTAL GREEDY LICENTIOUS AND FANATICAL SOLDIERY

lbi-6599-38590-0008 THE PEACE OF CAMBRAI WAS CALLED THE LADIES PEACE IN HONOR OF THE TWO PRINCESSES WHO HAD NEGOTIATED IT THOUGH MORALLY DIFFERENT AND OF VERY UNEQUAL WORTH THEY BOTH HAD MINDS OF A RARE ORDER AND TRAINED TO RECOGNIZE POLITICAL NECESSITIES AND NOT TO ATTEMPT ANY BUT POSSIBLE SUCCESSES
lbi-6599-38590-0009 ALL THE GREAT POLITICAL ACTORS SEEMED HURRYING AWAY FROM THE STAGE AS IF THE DRAMA WERE APPROACHING ITS END
lbi-6599-38591-0000 IN FIFTEEN SIXTY TWO AT THE BATTLE OF DREUX HE WAS AGED AND SO ILL THAT NONE EXPECTED TO SEE HIM ON HORSEBACK
lbi-6599-38591-0001 HE FULLY ARMED SAVE ONLY HIS HEAD ANSWERED HIM RIGHT WELL SIR THIS IS THE REAL MEDICINE THAT HATH CURED ME FOR THE BATTLE WHICH IS TOWARD AND A PREPARING FOR THE HONOR OF GOD AND OUR KING
lbi-6599-38591-0002 THE LADIES PEACE CONCLUDED AT CAMBRAI IN FIFTEEN TWENTY NINE LASTED UP TO FIFTEEN THIRTY SIX INCESSANTLY TROUBLED HOWEVER BY FAR FROM PACIFIC SYMPTOMS PROCEEDINGS AND PREPARATIONS
lbi-6599-38591-0003 AT LAST HE DECIDED UPON RETREATING
lbi-6599-38591-0004 IT WAS GARCILASO DE LA VEGA THE PRINCE OF SPANISH POESY THE SPANISH PETRARCH ACCORDING TO HIS FELLOW COUNTRYMEN
lbi-6599-38591-0005 MONTMORENCY SIGNED A SIMILAR ONE FOR PIEDMONT
lbi-6599-38591-0006 THEY ALL REPAIRED TOGETHER TO THE HOUSE PREPARED FOR THEIR RECEPTION AND AFTER DINNER THE EMPEROR BEING TIRED LAY DOWN TO REST ON A COUCH QUEEN ELEANOR BEFORE LONG WENT AND TAPPED AT HIS DOOR AND SENT WORD TO THE KING THAT THE EMPEROR WAS AWAKE
lbi-6599-38591-0007 FRANCIS WITH THE CARDINAL DE LORRAINE AND THE CONSTABLE DE MONTMORENCY SOON ARRIVED
lbi-6599-38591-0008 ON ENTERING THE CHAMBER HE FOUND THE EMPEROR STILL LYING DOWN AND CHATTING WITH HIS SISTER THE QUEEN WHO WAS SEATED BESIDE HIM ON A CHAIR
lbi-6599-38591-0009 YES SAID CHARLES I HAD MADE SUCH CHEER THAT I WAS OBLIGED TO SLEEP IT OFF
lbi-6599-38591-0010 FRANCIS DID THE CONVERSE WITH HIS OWN COLLAR
lbi-6599-38591-0011 ONLY SEVEN OF THE ATTENDANTS REMAINED IN THE EMPEROR'S CHAMBER AND THERE THE TWO SOVEREIGNS CONVERSED FOR AN HOUR AFTER WHICH THEY MOVED TO THE HALL WHERE A SPLENDID SUPPER AWAITED THEM
lbi-6599-38591-0012 THE GHENTESE PLEADED THEIR PRIVILEGE OF NOT BEING LIABLE TO BE TAXED WITHOUT THEIR OWN CONSENT
lbi-6599-38591-0013 ORDERS HAD BEEN SENT EVERYWHERE TO RECEIVE HIM AS KINGS OF FRANCE ARE RECEIVED ON THEIR JOYOUS ACCESSION
lbi-6841-88291-0000 BUT SINCE THERE EXISTED FOR US NO RESPONSIBILITY WE EACH REPORTED DUTIFULLY AT THE ROLL CALL OF HABIT AND DROPPED BACK INTO OUR BLANKETS WITH A GRATEFUL SIGH
lbi-6841-88291-0001 I REMEMBER THE MOON SAILING A GOOD GAIT AMONG APPARENTLY STATIONARY CLOUDLETS I RECALL A DEEP BLACK SHADOW LYING BEFORE DISTANT SILVERY MOUNTAINS I GLANCED OVER THE STARK MOTIONLESS CANVASES EACH OF WHICH CONCEALED A MAN THE AIR TREMBLED WITH THE BELLOWING OF CATTLE IN THE CORRALS
lbi-6841-88291-0002 SEEMINGLY BUT A MOMENT LATER THE COOK'S HOWL BROUGHT ME TO CONSCIOUSNESS AGAIN
lbi-6841-88291-0003 THREE WERE TO CARE FOR THE REMUDA FIVE WERE TO MOVE THE STRAY HERD FROM THE CORRALS TO GOOD FEED THREE BRANDING CREWS WERE TOLD TO BRAND THE CALVES WE HAD COLLECTED IN THE CUT OF THE AFTERNOON BEFORE THAT TOOK UP ABOUT HALF THE MEN
lbi-6841-88291-0004 THE REST WERE TO MAKE A SHORT DRIVE IN THE SALT GRASS
lbi-6841-88291-0005 WE WERE THE ONLY ONES WHO DID GO AFOOT HOWEVER ALTHOUGH THE CORRALS WERE NOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YARDS DISTANT
lbi-6841-88291-0006 BETWEEN THE UPRIGHT BARS OF GREASEWOOD WE COULD SEE THE CATTLE AND NEAR THE OPPOSITE SIDE THE MEN BUILDING A FIRE NEXT THE FENCE
lbi-6841-88291-0007 WE PUSHED OPEN THE WIDE GATE AND ENTERED
lbi-6841-88291-0008 ONE STOOD WAITING FOR THEM TO FINISH A SHEAF OF LONG J H STAMPING IRONS IN HIS HAND
lbi-6841-88291-0009 ALL THE REST SQUATTED ON THEIR HEELS ALONG THE FENCE SMOKING CIGARETTES AND CHATTING TOGETHER
lbi-6841-88291-0010 THE FIRST RAYS OF THE SUN SLANTED ACROSS IN ONE GREAT SWEEP FROM THE REMOTE MOUNTAINS
lbi-6841-88291-0011 HOMER WOODEN AND OLD CALIFORNIA JOHN RODE IN AMONG THE CATTLE
lbi-6841-88291-0012 AS THE LOOP SETTLED HE JERKED SHARPLY UPWARD EXACTLY AS ONE WOULD STRIKE TO HOOK A BIG FISH
lbi-6841-88291-0013 HOMER WRAPPED THE ROPE TWICE OR THRICE ABOUT THE HORN AND SAT OVER IN ONE STIRRUP TO AVOID THE TIGHTENED LINE AND TO PRESERVE THE BALANCE
lbi-6841-88291-0014 NOBODY PAID ANY ATTENTION TO THE CALF
lbi-6841-88291-0015 BEHIND HIM FOLLOWED HIS ANXIOUS MOTHER HER HEAD SWINGING FROM SIDE TO SIDE NEAR THE FIRE THE HORSE STOPPED
lbi-6841-88291-0016 THE TWO BULL DOGGERS IMMEDIATELY POUNCED UPON THE VICTIM
lbi-6841-88291-0017 IT WAS PROMPTLY FLOPPED OVER ON ITS RIGHT SIDE
lbi-6841-88291-0018 THUS THE CALF WAS UNABLE TO STRUGGLE
lbi-6841-88291-0019 WHEN ONCE YOU HAVE HAD THE WIND KNOCKED OUT OF YOU OR A RIB OR TWO BROKEN YOU CEASE TO THINK THIS UNNECESSARILY ROUGH
lbi-6841-88291-0020 HOT IRON YELLED ONE OF THE BULL DOGGERS
lbi-6841-88291-0021 MARKER YELLED THE OTHER
lbi-6841-88291-0022 THE BRANDER PRESSED THE IRON SMOOTHLY AGAINST THE FLANK
lbi-6841-88291-0023 PERHAPS THE CALF BLATTED A LITTLE AS THE HEAT SCORCHED
lbi-6841-88291-0024 THE BRAND SHOWED CHERRY WHICH IS THE PROPER COLOUR TO INDICATE DUE PEELING AND A SUCCESSFUL MARK
lbi-6841-88291-0025 THEN HE NICKED OUT A SWALLOW TAIL IN THE OTHER
lbi-6841-88291-0026 IT SEEMS TO ME THAT A GREAT DEAL OF UNNECESSARY TWADDLE IS ABROAD AS TO THE EXTREME CRUELTY OF BRANDING
lbi-6841-88291-0027 UNDOUBTEDLY IT IS TO SOME EXTENT PAINFUL AND COULD SOME OTHER METHOD OF READY IDENTIFICATION BE DEVISED IT MIGHT BE AS WELL TO ADOPT IT IN PREFERENCE
lbi-6841-88291-0028 INEXTINGUISHABLE LAUGHTER FOLLOWED THE SPREAD OF THIS DOCTRINE THROUGH ARIZONA
lbi-6841-88291-0029 IMAGINE A PUNCHER DESCENDING TO EXAMINE POLITELY THE EAR TAGS OF WILD CATTLE ON THE OPEN RANGE OR IN A ROUND UP
lbi-6841-88291-0030 A CALF USUALLY BELLOWS WHEN THE IRON BITES BUT AS SOON AS RELEASED HE ALMOST INVARIABLY GOES TO FEEDING OR TO LOOKING IDLY ABOUT
lbi-6841-88291-0031 BESIDES WHICH IT HAPPENS BUT ONCE IN A LIFETIME AND IS OVER IN TEN SECONDS A COMFORT DENIED TO THOSE OF US WHO HAVE OUR TEETH FILLED
lbi-6841-88291-0032 ONE OF THE LITTLE ANIMALS WAS BUT A FEW MONTHS OLD SO THE RIDER DID NOT BOTHER WITH ITS HIND LEGS BUT TOSSED HIS LOOP OVER ITS NECK
lbi-6841-88291-0033 MISTER FROST'S BULL CALF ALONE IN PICTORIAL HISTORY SHOWS THE ATTITUDES
lbi-6841-88291-0034 AND THEN OF COURSE THERE WAS THE GORGEOUS CONTRAST BETWEEN ALL THIS FRANTIC AND UNCOMPREHENDING EXCITEMENT AND THE ABSOLUTE MATTER OF FACT IMPERTURBABILITY OF HORSE AND RIDER
lbi-6841-88291-0035 AS HE KNEW HIS BUSINESS AND AS THE CALF WAS A SMALL ONE THE LITTLE BEAST WENT OVER PROMPTLY BIT THE GROUND WITH A WHACK AND WAS POUNCED UPON AND HELD
lbi-6841-88291-0036 HE WOULD CATCH HIMSELF ON ONE FOOT SCRAMBLE VIGOROUSLY AND END BY STRUGGLING BACK TO THE UPRIGHT
lbi-6841-88291-0037 YOU CAN IMAGINE WHAT HAPPENED NEXT
lbi-6841-88291-0038 THIS IS PRODUCTIVE OF SOME FUN IF IT FAILS
lbi-6841-88291-0039 BY NOW THE BRANDING WAS IN FULL SWING
lbi-6841-88291-0040 WHEN THE NOOSES FELL THEY TURNED AND WALKED TOWARD THE FIRE AS A MATTER OF COURSE RARELY DID THE CAST FAIL
lbi-6841-88291-0041 MEN RAN TO AND FRO BUSY AND INTENT
lbi-6841-88291-0042 SOMETIMES THREE OR FOUR CALVES WERE ON THE GROUND AT ONCE
lbi-6841-88291-0043 DUST EDDIED AND DISSIPATED
lbi-6841-88291-0044 NO MORE NECKED CALVES THEY ANNOUNCED
lbi-6841-88291-0045 THEN HE WOULD SPIT ON HIS HANDS AND GO AT IT ALONE
lbi-6841-88291-0046 IF LUCK ATTENDED HIS FIRST EFFORT HIS SARCASM WAS PROFOUND THERE'S YORE LITTLE CALF SAID HE
lbi-6841-88291-0047 WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE ME TOTE IT TO YOU OR DO YOU RECKON YOU COULD TODDLE THIS FAR WITH YORE LITTLE OLD IRON
lbi-6841-88291-0048 TOWARD NOON THE WORK SLACKED
lbi-6841-88291-0049 FINALLY HOMER RODE OVER TO THE CATTLEMAN AND REPORTED THE BRANDING FINISHED
lbi-6841-88291-0050 THE LATTER COUNTED THE MARKS IN HIS TALLY BOOK
lbi-6841-88291-0051 ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX HE ANNOUNCED
lbi-6841-88291-0052 THE MARKERS SQUATTED ON THEIR HEELS TOLD OVER THE BITS OF EARS THEY HAD SAVED
lbi-6841-88291-0053 THE TOTAL AMOUNTED TO BUT AN HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE
lbi-6841-88291-0054 FINALLY WOODEN DISCOVERED IT IN HIS HIP POCKET
lbi-6841-88291-0055 THEY HAD BEEN DOING A WRESTLER'S HEAVY WORK ALL THE MORNING BUT DID NOT SEEM TO BE TIRED
lbi-6841-88291-0056 I SAW ONCE IN SOME CRANK PHYSICAL CULTURE PERIODICAL THAT A COWBOY'S LIFE WAS PHYSICALLY ILL BALANCED LIKE AN OARSMAN'S IN THAT IT EXERCISED ONLY CERTAIN MUSCLES OF THE BODY
lbi-6841-88294-0000 AT THIS MOMENT THE HEAVY BEAT OF THE STORM ON THE ROOF CEASED WITH MIRACULOUS SUDDENNESS LEAVING THE OUTSIDE WORLD EMPTY OF SOUND SAVE FOR THE DRIP DRIP DRIP OF EAVES
lbi-6841-88294-0001 WE HAD EVERY SORT OF PEOPLE WITH US OFF AND ON AND AS I WAS LOOKOUT AT A POPULAR GAME I SAW THEM ALL
lbi-6841-88294-0002 AT THE SAME INSTANT I HEARD THE RIP OF STEEL THROUGH CLOTH AND FELT A SHARP STAB IN MY LEFT LEG
lbi-6841-88294-0003 THEN I SCOUTED TO SEE WHAT HAD CUT ME AND FOUND THAT THE FELLOW HAD LOST A HAND
lbi-6841-88294-0004 IN PLACE OF IT HE WORE A SHARP STEEL HOOK
lbi-6841-88294-0005 THERE WAS NO DOUBT OF HIS BEING ALIVE FOR HE WAS BREATHING HARD LIKE A MAN DOES WHEN HE GETS HIT OVER THE HEAD IT DIDN'T SOUND GOOD
lbi-6841-88294-0006 WHEN A MAN BREATHES THAT WAY HE'S MOSTLY ALL GONE
lbi-6841-88294-0007 MEN GOT BATTED OVER THE HEAD OFTEN ENOUGH IN THOSE DAYS
lbi-6841-88294-0008 SOUR WINE IS FINE TO PUT A WOUND IN SHAPE TO HEAL BUT IT'S NO SOOTHING SYRUP
lbi-6841-88294-0009 THEIR COFFIN WAS THEIR SHIP AND THEIR GRAVE IT WAS THE SEA BLOW HIGH BLOW LOW WHAT CARE WE AND THE QUARTER THAT WE GAVE THEM WAS TO SINK THEM IN THE SEA DOWN ON THE COAST OF THE HIGH BARBAREE
lbi-6841-88294-0010 IT FAIR MADE MY HAIR RISE TO HEAR HIM WITH THE BIG STILL SOLEMN DESERT OUTSIDE AND THE QUIET MOONLIGHT AND THE SHADOWS AND HIM SITTING UP STRAIGHT AND GAUNT HIS EYES BLAZING EACH SIDE HIS BIG EAGLE NOSE AND HIS SNAKY HAIR HANGING OVER THE RAW CUT ACROSS HIS HEAD
lbi-6841-88294-0011 HOWEVER I MADE OUT TO GET HIM BANDAGED UP AND IN SHAPE AND PRETTY SOON HE SORT OF WENT TO SLEEP
lbi-6841-88294-0012 THEN AGAIN HE'D SING THAT BARBAREE SONG UNTIL I'D GO OUT AND LOOK AT THE OLD COLORADO FLOWING BY JUST TO BE SURE I HADN'T DIED AND GONE BELOW OR ELSE HE'D JUST TALK
lbi-6841-88294-0013 HE BEGAN WHEN HE WAS A KID AND HE GAVE HIS SIDE OF CONVERSATIONS PAUSING FOR REPLIES
lbi-6841-88294-0014 I USED TO LISTEN BY THE HOUR BUT I NEVER MADE OUT ANYTHING REALLY IMPORTANT AS TO WHO THE MAN WAS OR WHERE HE'D COME FROM OR WHAT HE'D DONE
lbi-6841-88294-0015 I DIDN'T PAY ANY ATTENTION TO HIM FOR HE WAS QUIET
lbi-6841-88294-0016 USUALLY I DIDN'T BOTHER WITH HIS TALK FOR IT DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING BUT SOMETHING IN HIS VOICE MADE ME TURN
lbi-6841-88294-0017 HE WAS LYING ON HIS SIDE THOSE BLACK EYES OF HIS BLAZING AT ME BUT NOW BOTH OF THEM SAW THE SAME DISTANCE
lbi-6841-88294-0018 WHERE ARE MY CLOTHES HE ASKED VERY INTENSE
lbi-6841-88294-0019 ONE LITTLE SQUEEZE TALK ABOUT YOUR DEADLY WEAPONS
lbi-6841-88294-0020 BUT HE'D BEEN TOO SICK AND TOO LONG ABED
lbi-6841-88294-0021 IN A MINUTE OR SO HE CAME TO
lbi-6841-88294-0022 NOW YOU'RE A NICE SWEET PROPOSITION SAID I AS SOON AS I WAS SURE HE COULD UNDERSTAND ME
lbi-6841-88294-0023 THEY'RE SAFE ENOUGH LET ME HAVE THEM HE BEGGED
lbi-6841-88294-0024 NOW LOOK HERE SAID I YOU CAN'T GET UP TO DAY YOU AIN'T FIT
lbi-6841-88294-0025 I KNOW HE PLEADED BUT LET ME SEE THEM
lbi-6841-88294-0026 JUST TO SATISFY HIM I PASSED OVER HIS OLD DUDS
lbi-6841-88294-0027 I'VE BEEN ROBBED HE CRIED
lbi-6841-88294-0028 WHERE'S MY COAT HE ASKED
lbi-6841-88294-0029 YOU HAD NO COAT WHEN I PICKED YOU UP I REPLIED
lbi-6841-88294-0030 HE LOOKED AT ME MIGHTY SUSPICIOUS BUT DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING MORE HE WOULDN'T EVEN ANSWER WHEN I SPOKE TO HIM
lbi-6841-88294-0031 AFTER HE'D EATEN A FAIR MEAL HE FELL ASLEEP
lbi-6841-88294-0032 WHEN I CAME BACK THAT EVENING THE BUNK WAS EMPTY AND HE WAS GONE
lbi-6841-88294-0033 I DIDN'T SEE HIM AGAIN FOR TWO DAYS
lbi-6841-88294-0034 THEN I CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM QUITE A WAYS OFF
lbi-6841-88294-0035 GUESS HE SUSPICIONS I STOLE THAT OLD COAT OF HIS THINKS I AND AFTERWARDS I FOUND THAT MY SURMISE HAD BEEN CORRECT
lbi-6841-88294-0036 HOWEVER HE DIDN'T STAY LONG IN THAT FRAME OF MIND
lbi-6841-88294-0037 I RAN UP PULLING MY GUN
lbi-6841-88294-0038 THE MEX WAS FLAT ON HIS FACE HIS ARMS STRETCHED OUT
lbi-6841-88294-0039 ON THE MIDDLE OF HIS BACK KNELT MY ONE ARMED FRIEND
lbi-6841-88294-0040 ANYWAY I THRUST THE MUZZLE OF MY COLT'S INTO THE SAILOR'S FACE WHAT'S THIS I ASKED
lbi-6841-88294-0041 I WEEN HEEM AT MONTE OFF ANTONIO CURVEZ SAID HE
lbi-6841-88294-0042 THE GLEAM DIED FROM HIS EYE THE SNARL LEFT HIS LIPS
lbi-6841-88294-0043 IN ANY CASE HE FLEW POCO PRONTO LEAVING ME AND MY FRIEND TOGETHER
lbi-6841-88294-0044 DURING THE NEXT TWO MONTHS HE WAS A GOOD DEAL ABOUT TOWN MOSTLY DOING ODD JOBS I SAW HIM OFF AND ON
lbi-6841-88294-0045 HOWEVER I DIDN'T PAY MUCH ATTENTION TO THAT BEING AT THE TIME ALMIGHTY BUSY HOLDING DOWN MY CARD GAMES
lbi-6841-88294-0046 THAT'S ALL RIGHT SAID I BUT YOU BETTER STAY RIGHT THERE
lbi-6841-88294-0047 I WANT TO MAKE UP TO YOU FOR YOUR TROUBLE SAID HE
lbi-6841-88294-0048 WHAT KIND OF A GOOD THING I ASKED TREASURE SAID HE
lbi-6841-88294-0049 HE LOOKED ALL RIGHT ENOUGH NEITHER DRUNK NOR LOCO

lbi-6841-88294-0055 WHY DON'T YOU GET YOUR TREASURE WITHOUT THE NEED OF DIVIDING IT
lbi-6841-88294-0056 WHY MATE HE ANSWERED IT'S JUST PLAIN GRATITUDE

lbi-6841-88294-0060 THE DEVIL'S A PREACHER IF YOU AIN'T LOST YOUR PINFEATHERS SAID HE
lbi-6841-88294-0061 WELL IT'S THIS THEN I GOT TO HAVE A BOAT TO GET THERE AND SHE MUST BE STOCKED

lbi-6841-88294-0066 I STOOD OUT FOR A LARGER PARTY
lbi-6841-88294-0067 HE STRONGLY OPPOSED THIS AS DEPRECIATING THE SHARES BUT I HAD NO INTENTION OF GOING ALONE INTO WHAT WAS THEN CONSIDERED A WILD AND DANGEROUS COUNTRY FINALLY WE COMPROMISED
lbi-6841-88294-0068 A THIRD OF THE TREASURE WAS TO GO TO HIM A THIRD TO ME AND THE REST WAS TO BE DIVIDED AMONG THE MEN WHOM I SHOULD SELECT THIS SCHEME DID NOT APPEAL TO HIM
