021680237	ANY REPORTS ON THE CONTENTS OF THE PIE
021680246	MAN PILLAR IS THE BEST
021680249	FACTS ARE OF NO IMPORTANCE TO THEM
021680251	MAYBE IT'S THE SAME MENU
021680266	LOVE COMING TO THE BRAVES GAME
021680288	UNLUCKY NOT TO GO ON AND WIN THE GAME TODAY
021680297	WE HAD A LITTLE TROUBLE FINDING YOU

021680332	THAT WAS WHY WE SHIFTED
021680369	HERE IT IS YOU SEE SIR

021700240	VERY IMPORTANT VICTORY WE ARE ON THE RIGHT WAY
021700277	GOING TO DO SOME WORK IN A BIT

021700291	THAT WAS A GREAT CHAPTER
021700300	ALL I CAN DO IS SIT BACK AND LAUGH
021700362	AND THE ANSWER IS YES
021700379	MARK IS A BAD CORRESPONDENT
021790008	JIM WENT TO SEE KANGAROO

021790169	HE WOULD GO OUT BUT WHEN
021790173	YOU HAVE NO IDEAS HAVE YOU
022080028	I THOUGHT IT WAS PRETTY SIMPLE
022080038	I THINK THE KEY WORD IS PROBABLY
022080085	THERE WAS NO RECORD OF ADOPTION
022080100	I WANT TO WIN IT VERY MUCH

022080202	TIGERS ARE ON THE BOARD
022080204	UNTIL THEN YOU ARE BLOCKED
022080210	ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO BE PART OF THE CHRISTIAN RIGHT
022080294	AND WHO IS THE JUDGE
022080299	I'D LOVE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE NEXT ONE
022080340	BECAUSE WHY WOULD ANYBODY CHOOSE TO BE UNHAPPY
022080341	HIS FIRST BOW TO THE PUBLIC
022360092	SO THAT IS PROBABLY AN UPPER LIMIT
022360126	THE ONLY THING HAVE TO PAY IS ATTENTION
022360147	YOU ALL IN MY PRAYERS
022360159	ARE YOU NOT GOING TO TOUR
022360185	WHAT A GREAT FRIDAY EVENING
022360186	GLAD YOU LIKE THE SONG

022360265	AND WHAT WILL YOU DO TO GET THERE
022360293	I WAS SO PROUD OF MYSELF
022360310	HER MOTHER WHO HAD MADE HER WAS NO HUMAN
022360311	COME TO THE HOUSE AND STAY
022360321	THERE'S NOTHING THAT UNUSUAL ABOUT THE STRUCTURE OF THE PLAN
022360326	WILL FIND THIS OUT SOME DAY
022360350	I WILL GO AND LOOK FOR IT
022420015	IT MADE ME FEEL GOOD
022420045	ONLY THE BOATS ARE ARMED LIGHTLY
022420067	IT'S NOT GOING TO KILL THEM
022420073	YET ALL IT TAKES IS THREE TWO ONE
022420086	SATURDAY WINNING COLORS WILL BECOME THE SECOND
022420106	EVERYONE CAN WIN AT HOME
022420129	STILL ONE OF MY FEARS
022420138	IF YOU NEED A REMINDER
022420146	THE SPRING MARKET IS STRONG
022420164	SURE IT COULD HAPPEN TO ANYONE
022420168	IT'S NICE TO GET BACK INTO IT AGAIN
022420172	BLUE WAS READY TO GO
022420273	HOW ARE YOU GETTING ON WITH YOUR BIKE
022420288	WE HAVE TO MAKE A STAND NOW
022420292	MY HOME IS IN THE STARS
022420306	IT IS MY LOVE THAT IS BOLD
022420342	WAS HE NOT HAPPY TOO
022420346	WE NEITHER OF US KNOW MUCH ABOUT IT
022420348	THERE WAS ALWAYS A DAY WHEN SHE CALLED TIME
022420362	THEY BOTH LAUGHED AND FOR A LONG TIME
022440038	INSURANCE IS A MAJOR CONSIDERATION IN MOVING
022440039	HE KNOWS BETTER THAN TO TELL ME ABOUT THOSE THINGS
022440062	AFTER THAT COMES THE UNITED STATES AND THE WORLD
022440073	THE DANGERS OF HANGING OUT IN PUBLIC PLACES
022440126	SO YOU SHOULD BE FINE
022440134	THEY HAVE HAD THEIR CHANCE FOR MONTHS
022440139	POP IT ON THE LIST
022440144	SO YOU KNOW THE USUAL
022440165	SEEING YOU LIKE THIS IS NOT PRETTY
022440180	NOTHING BETTER THAN A DAY AT THE BEACH
022440189	IT'S UP TO YOU TO MAKE SURE THEY NEVER FORGET
022440215	YOU WILL BE THERE IN SPIRIT
022440277	PLEASE KEEP IN TOUCH WITH ME
022440286	WHAT'S THE BEST WAY TO GET A HOLD OF YOU
022440312	IT'S AS STEADY AS A ROCK
022440337	WHEN SHE LOOKED UP SHE BEAMED
022440340	THE TRAIL THOUGH WOULD BE EXTENSIVE
022440352	A THOUSAND YEARS AGO IT SEEMED
022440361	BUT ONLY IF SHE COULD HANDLE THE HEAT
022440362	AS IF SHE WANTED HIM TO LEAVE
022510066	BUT WE WOULD ASK MORE OF YOU
022510069	THAT'S WHY IT IS SO DIFFICULT
022510089	BUT WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS
022510093	WE MIGHT GET BEAT AND WE MIGHT WIN
022510095	THEY ALL LIVED IN THE SAME STREET
022510122	YOU KNOW THIS COULD BE TRUE
022510152	TAG A FRIEND YOU WISH YOU WERE HERE WITH
022510166	FASHION IS IN A TERRIBLE STATE
022510190	IT'S A BIT OF A FEAR FOR ME THAT
022510211	HOW ABOUT THIS FOR A CHANGE
022510230	THAT WAY PEOPLE WOULD LOVE TO SEE IT LIVE
022510237	I THINK WE SHOULD GET HIM ON THE SHOW
022510255	I MAY STILL BE TIRED
022510266	VIDEO ABOUT THE NEW LOCATION
022510276	REMEMBER THAT WE ARE ALL EQUAL
022510291	MATCH OF THE YEAR SO FAR
022510300	I THINK IT IS TIME
022510320	KEEPING MY HAND IN MY POCKET
022510323	SHE WANTS TO GET CAUGHT
022510368	BUT HOW MANY WILL NEVER SEE IT
022820020	THE MAN YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT HAD A BROWN JACKET
022820021	SOME WORKERS WERE BACK ON THE JOB
022820026	THEY WOULD NOT STAND FOR IT
022820042	SOMEBODY WHO CAN HIT HOME RUNS AND DRIVE IN RUNS
022820062	HE PROBABLY IS THE MOST TALENTED IN THE SECONDARY
022820072	IF THERE WERE GAMES WE WOULD BENEFIT FROM THEM
022820079	I WAS WATCHING BACK AND FIRTH BACK AND FIRTH
022820106	MANY OF THE TROOPS WERE BADLY BURNED
022820107	I JUST WANTED TO PLAY STEADY
022820121	ANIMAL KINGDOM DAY AND NIGHT
022820134	WHAT A GREAT SUNDAY MORNING
022820142	THEY HAD A GOOD SEASON
022820155	QUICK CHANGE HOW DO YOU DO IT
022820191	GOING TO TRY AND MAKE IT
022820197	FIRST GAME DAY OF THE YEAR
022820281	WE ARE IN THE BACK
022820291	I READ A LOT OF FICTION
022820293	EDGE OF TOMORROW IS GOOD TIME
022820317	WE CAN TALK ABOUT THIS LATER
022820357	HERE'S THE GREAT MAN HIMSELF
023800015	I AM SO SORRY TO ALL OF YOU
023800042	THE OTHERS WERE TREATED IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM
023800056	HE MAY HAVE ALREADY STARTED
023800093	THAT'S A GOOD WAY TO APPROACH IT I THINK
023800114	HE SHOULD HAVE LET THE ORGANIZATION AND THE MANAGER KNOW
023800124	WE HAVE TO LET THEM KNOW THEY ARE SPECIAL
023800160	GOING TO ANY OTHER GAMES
023800186	I MADE IT TO THE FINALE
023800242	CERTAINLY YOU CAN BE MORE SPECIFIC
023800260	HOW MUCH TIME DO YOU SPEND DOING
023800277	BUT NO NEED FOR THAT NOW
023800278	I WAS ABLE TO DEFEND AGAINST IT SUCCESSFULLY
023800280	HOPE SHE HAD A GOOD DAY MATE
023800298	PLANTS GROW TO THE SIZE OF THE POT
023800326	THAT KID HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT
023800330	IT WAS PROBABLY ABOUT FIVE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
023800338	THIS IS NO FANCY SKETCH BUT THE TRUTH
023800352	SHE WAS LARGE AND SHE WAS KIND
023800363	THUS FAR THEREFORE ALL WAS WELL
023800368	THE HOUSE WAS VERY STILL
024020047	ARE YOU GOING TO HAVE ANOTHER DRINK
024020051	AS OF MONDAY MORNING THE POST IS STILL UP
024020053	THAT'S A LONG WAY TO RUN
024020069	THERE WAS NO REQUEST MADE FOR THE GUARD TODAY
024020084	HE'S HONEST TO BE THE BONE
024020142	INTERESTED IN LEARNING MORE ABOUT THE EVENTS I PRODUCE
024020158	WELL TIME FOR ME TO GO TO SLEEP
024020175	ALCOHOL IS ALWAYS THE ANSWER
024020176	PUMPED FOR THE RETURN OF THE KING TODAY
024020205	IT SHOULD BE A GOOD NIGHT
024020233	SO THIS SEEMS LIKE A PRETTY BIG DEAL
024020238	SEE ALL I HAD TO DO WAS COMPLAIN
024020253	SPIRITUAL FORMATION IS NOT SOMETHING WE MASTER
024020256	WINNING IS SO MUCH FUN
024020260	BLESS SUGAR RAY AND HIS FAMILY
024020265	HANGING OUT AT THE BEACH
024020291	THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN IN THE UNIVERSE
024020321	IT IS NOW TWO O'CLOCK
024020328	HE WAS TWENTY WHEN HE LEARNED THE TRUTH ABOUT HIMSELF
024020337	I WISH YOU TO TAKE CARE OF THESE TWO LETTERS
024270011	MORE SNOW WAS IN THE FORECAST FOR MONDAY NIGHT
024270019	IN THIS CASE IT'S NOT NECESSARY
024270028	TODAY THEY ARE MORE DYNAMIC AND MORE HUMANE
024270051	OTHERS ARE NOT QUITE SO SURE HOWEVER
024270053	THEY ARE SO DEEP IN TALENT
024270057	EACH TEAM STARTS AT THE SAME TIME
024270077	BUT I SAW IT AGAIN
024270127	WE WERE TALKING ABOUT SOCCER
024270155	BACK AND AT JUST THE RIGHT TIME
024270168	WHAT DO YOU THINK THOSE ARE
024270176	STILL WAITING FOR IT TO HAPPEN
024270178	LOOKS TO BE WORTH THE WAIT
024270183	FEELS SO GOOD TO BE BACK TOGETHER
024270197	LISTEN TO IT IN ALL ITS GLORY
024270206	MASKS ARE PART OF UNIFORM
024270245	WHEN IS IT TIME TO TALK ABOUT GUNS
024270270	THIS IS NOT A NICE STORY IT'S TRUE
024270292	WE SHOULD TOTALLY GO FOR A WALK
024270313	BUT THEY MUST DO IT
024270336	AND NOW IT'S MY TURN
024300001	THERE MAY BE A WAY TO CHANGE ALL THAT
024300052	NOW HE'S OPEN HE CAN SELL IT TO YOU
024300061	IT WAS A NEW MARKET
024300063	COULD YOU PUT HIM ON THE BOARD
024300065	HE WAS NOT SUPPORTED BY THE PARTY THERE
024300068	SO THEY HAVE TO GO WITH MORE SOPHISTICATE POSITIONING
024300080	BUT IS NOT NOW
024300082	NOW BECAUSE OF DRAGONS LOOK WHERE HE IS TODAY
024300093	THERE IS ALWAYS THE QUESTION OF WHAT WILL FOLLOW
024300099	THE ECONOMY IS FAR FROM SOUND
024300118	KEEP IN TOUCH HAVE A GREAT WEEKEND
024300131	I MEAN IT WAS THE LAST SUPPER
024300132	WELL THANKS FOR THE CONSIDERATION
024300135	HE ALWAYS KNOWS HOW TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER
024300189	IT'S WEDNESDAY YOU KNOW THE DRILL
024300221	ENOUGH OF THE TIME LOOP
024300270	IT IS SUCH A GOOD FIRM
024300330	AT FIRST HE COULD NOT SPEAK
024300345	AND NOW I GO DOWN TO LOOK AT IT
024300360	SHE WAS BROAD AT THIS SHOULDERS
024500006	THREE AND FOUR ARE THE BEST
024500021	HE AND HIS PARENTS SAY THEY ARE NO LONGER SPEAKING
024500033	ENOUGH OF THE TECHNICAL STUFF
024500095	WE ALL KNOW THIS IS A TOUGH RACE TRACK
024500126	YOU MUST HAVE A LOT
024500139	BUT I KNOW WHAT YOU ARE
024500141	THIS WOULD BE A VERY BUSY DAY
024500147	I COME FROM A FAMILY OF TEACHERS
024500151	SORRY FOR BEING A PLASTIC
024500156	WHAT DO YOU SAY THE MOST
024500164	WHAT AND HOW DO YOU SING
024500228	WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO BE READY TO PLAY
024500250	DO YOU LIKE THE COLOR OF THE SKY
024500268	WHY IN THE WORLD AM I NOT IN THE BED
024500284	IT'S SUNDAY NIGHT NOT THE END OF THE WORLD
024500317	AND IN A SENSE YOU WERE RIGHT
024500327	AND IT IS MY OWN HAND
024500333	AS FOR THE FINAL THREE
024500350	HE STARED AT THE STUDENTS
024500363	THERE'S NOTHING TO DO BUT GET DRUNK
026210005	THANK YOU AND GOD BLESS YOU ALL
026210047	YOU TRY NOT TO THINK ABOUT THOSE KIND OF THINGS
026210096	IT'S A VICTORY LAP FOR ME
026210123	JUST WONDERING WHAT TO DO WITH THE CAT
026210132	AND WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED SO FAR
026210135	COULD NOT BE SO PROUD

026210141	LOT MORE TO LIFE THAN FOOTBALL
026210157	HI ANGEL YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN
026210177	WAIT YOU CAN SEE THAT CAN YOU
026210185	HOPELESSNESS IS A GREAT SIGH
026210203	IT WAS SO GREAT TO SEE EVERYONE
026210213	THEY TALK A LOT OF SENSE
026210220	IT'S NOT AS SWEET WHEN YOU HAVE TO SHARE
026210231	A LIGHT IN THE SHADOW
026210242	HOPE TO SEE MUCH MORE OF YOU

040050281	I CAN HELP YOU WITH THE WEIGHT LOSS
040050295	WHY ARE YOU GOING TO GET ONE
040050306	I WAS GRATEFUL TO HER
040050358	BECAUSE I CAN KEEP YOU SAFE
051950005	SHALL I OPEN IT AND COME IN
051950011	ASK HIM TO LOOK IN AND SEE ME
051950018	THERE WAS A GREAT SURPRISE IN HER FACE ALSO
051950025	GO AWAY AND LEAVE ME
051950032	GO AWAY FROM THE TABLE
051950033	WAS IT IN SIX HOURS THAT THE FRENCH WERE COMING
051950038	NO THEY MUST SEE NO CHANGE
051950044	CAN THIS TALE BE TRUE
051950050	COME COME THIS WON'T DO
051950051	YOUR FATHER WAS MY FRIEND
051950067	THE FIRST DAY OF THE WAKE IS NOTHING TO IT
051950075	I SHALL GO AND LOOK FOR SOME MONEY
051950086	WHAT BILLS WILL THAT PAY
051950088	SHE FOLLOWED AND LOOKED
051950096	THE MONKEY CAN'T TAKE IT HOME
051950138	BUT WHO ELSE WAS TO DO IT
051950154	DO THEY BEGIN TO FORGET US
051950163	BUT NOW THEY WERE PARTED
051950164	IT WAS QUITE A FAMILY PARTY
051950170	I ALSO SOON LEARNED THE WAY TO BE HUNGRY
052180017	AND SHALL I TELL YOU WHY
052180027	AH I COULD SEE IT
052180028	I HAD BETTER GO ON WITH THE STORY

052180093	IN HALF AN HOUR THE DOCTOR WOULD BE BACK
052180098	WELL I WILL TELL YOU HOW I KNOW
052180104	THEY WILL BEGIN TO KNOW THEMSELVES FOR WHAT THEY ARE
052180112	I THINK THE SHAKING HURT HIS FEELINGS VERY MUCH
052180117	VERY GOOD FOR TRAVELERS
052180124	THEIR LOOKS WERE BIG WITH SOME IMPORTANT NEWS
052180137	WE SHALL NEVER SEE YOU FACE HERE AGAIN
052180143	WE HAD BECOME WELL USE TO THE CLOTHES
052180146	I SHALL NEVER BE WHAT HE WAS
052180160	THE MORNING THAT WE PARTED TOO
054010004	THE DOCTOR ASKED LEAVE TO SAY ONE WORD MORE
054010009	AFTER LUNCH SHE READS NEWSPAPERS
054010014	WITH MY OWN HAND
054010032	BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME
054010046	ELSE WHY SHOULD WE COME
054010051	I'LL TAKE CARE OF DAD
054010055	YOU'RE A NICE WOMAN
054010061	NOT THE SEA SURELY
054010072	SHALL I JUMP OUT
054010079	OF THESE THREE ALL DAUGHTERS LIVED TO GROW UP
054010091	MOTHER AND SON TALKED TOGETHER
054010095	AND WITHOUT ANY MORE GROUNDS
054010105	SHE OPEN THE WINDOW EAT
054010107	FINE FIND FINE COULD BE ONLY BE
054010123	YOUR DAUGHTER LOVES ME
054010130	WEST IS THE NAME
054010136	THESE ARE THINGS WHICH A MAN CANNOT FORGET
054010148	ALONE IN HIS ROOM
054010155	WE ARE BORN COUSINS
054010165	I'M GLAD BECAUSE I LOVE DRIVING
054080004	THEN EACH LOOKED OUT OF THE WINDOW
054080008	NOTHING BUT GOOD FROM THIS
054080011	NOW HE WAS GOING AWAY
054080019	YOU MAY TAKE HER OR LEAVE HER
054080021	THEY WERE NEVER AN HOUR ALONE
054080033	BUT A GREAT STRONG MAN
054080035	I DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO GIVE ME THEIR MONEY
054080042	IT WAS FAR FAR AWAY BY THIS TIME
054080065	AND THE THREE TURNED AWAY
054080081	YOU HAVE DONE THAT WHICH MUST MAKE A FATHER ANGRY
054080109	THE LITTLE MAN WAS DOING THE SAME FOR ME
054080123	SHALL YOU TURN ME OUT
054080138	WELL THAT WAS TRUE IN PART
054080150	AND LOOKING UP HE SAW HIM
054080151	I MUST WASH MY HANDS FIRST
054080154	BUT WHAT A CAPITAL WORLD IT IS
054080163	HE MUST LEAVE HIS MONEY TO SOMEBODY
054080165	I MUST DO SOMETHING FOR MY LIVING
054080167	THEY CAN ONLY GO BACK ON THEMSELVES
054080174	THE GREAT WORK IT SHALL BE CARRY ON
054140003	YOU SHALL GO WITH HIM
054140010	HOW COULD SHE LIVE AND WHAT WOULD SHE DO
054140015	I DON'T KNOW THEM
054140019	WE ARE NOT TOO LATE
054140021	THAT THEY COULD NOT TELL US
054140039	THEN SHALL WE LIVE
054140051	IT IS YOU WHO MUST GO
054140057	LET ME READ IT TO YOU
054140077	HOW WAS SHE TO TAKE ANY PRESENT FROM HIM NOW
054140098	BUT YOU MUST NOT FORGET ME
054140104	I NEVER PART WITH THEM
054140106	I MUST HAVE IT
054140113	I ASKED FOR NOTHING
054140115	I SHALL HAVE THINGS TO SAY
054140118	BUT I SHALL SPEAK OF HER AGAIN
054140119	WHY IS IT TOO LATE
054140122	YOU HAVE HAD YOUR OWN WAY
054140127	YOU SHALL NOT BE THE ONE TO GO
054140154	WHAT ELSE COULD ONE SAY
054140158	SHE WANTED TO SEE HIS FACE AGAIN
054180014	DON'T LET GO MY HAND
054180015	NO CLOTHES NO MONEY
054180021	YOU LIKE YOUR ART BETTER THAN YOU FRIENDS
054180022	IT HAS PASSED INTO OTHER HANDS NOW
054180029	NOTHING FOR NOTHING YOUNG MAN
054180033	HIS MIND WAS BUSY
054180059	I CAN'T BE DIFFERENT
054180063	HIS FACE WAS COLD
054180075	COULD YOU BEAR IT
054180076	FOR A TIME HE COULD NOT FIND WORDS
054180077	WHO ELSE SAYS SO
054180079	I'M NOT BIG ENOUGH
054180087	OUR MEETING COULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED BETTER
054180091	THEN THE STORY WAS FINISHED
054180096	I LIKE TO MEET HIM
054180111	I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND DRIVING
054180123	I HAD LEARNED WHAT I NEEDED
054180126	NEVER AGAIN COULD SHE CLOSE THEM
054180130	BUT THEY MUST BE NICE ONES LIKE YOURS YOU KNOW
054180174	MEET ME HERE AT THE SAME HOUR TOMORROW
054240002	AT THAT TIME TOO OF ALL OTHERS
054240025	HIS OWN GIRL MIND YOU
054240038	IT WAS PART OF OUR WORK
054240039	IN THE AFTERNOON I SAW HIM
054240048	AND I DON'T ALWAYS TRY
054240053	HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE THERE IN MY FAMILY
054240079	I CANNOT ASK YOU
054240091	COULD IT SEE HIM
054240093	WHERE MUST I GO
054240094	LOOK AT MY FACE
054240097	HERE IT IS AND YOU CAN READ FOR YOURSELF
054240099	SHE HAD NOT AGAIN I LEARNED TO LOVE HER COUSIN
054240109	YOU MUST DO YOU BEST
054240115	SHE WAS ALONE HIS LIGHT LOST
054240116	AND CAN YOU TEACH ME THEN
054240117	I SURE GET MY HAND OUT
054240125	BUT YOU SHALL LISTEN TO ME
054240126	BUT THERE WERE OTHERS ALSO PRESENT
054240138	BUT YOU MUST HAVE SOMETHING TO EAT
054240152	NO ONE SAW IT FOR A MOMENT OR SO
055510024	I HAVE LIVED IN THE PLACE
055510029	WHEN COULD WE DO IT
055510046	SHE IS BETTER OFF THAN I CAN MAKE HER
055510061	BUT SHE COULD NEVER BE CROSS WITH HIM
055510067	HE WOULD BE GOING AWAY
055510070	FOR AN HOUR THEY WALKED AND TALKED
055510078	AND NOW GO AWAY
055510079	YOU MAY SAY THAT TURNED
055510084	THEN SHE WAS LEFT ALONE
055510088	WHAT IS BIG AND WHAT IS LITTLE
055510093	AND YOU'RE THE SAME MAN TOO
055510096	SHE COULD NOT FACE IT
055510100	YOU SHALL SOON HAVE HER BACK
055510110	I COULD NEVER LOVE YOU AGAIN
055510122	FOURTEEN FIFTEEN EIGHTEEN HOURS A DAY
055510130	WAS IT NOT BY HIS DONE WILL
055510143	WHO WOULD HAVE BROKEN THE NEWS TO THE FATHER
055510156	I SHOULD CALL IT SOMETHING ELSE
055510164	FATHER IS ALONE YOU WILL BE GLAD TO SEE YOU
055510165	IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT
060100004	SHE TURNED ROUND AS THEY ENTERED
060100009	THE VOICE CAME FROM ABOVE THEM
060100031	HE IS MADE SO AS NOT TO BE AFRAID
060100034	WHAT WHAT DID HE WANT THERE
060100037	THAT'S WAS THE DIFFERENCE
060100041	THERE WHERE NO MEANS OF DOING IT
060100047	BUT SUCH IS THE WAY ALL THE GREAT
060100066	THEY ALL SAID GOODBYE
060100081	I DID MYSELF SO I KNOW WHAT THIS LIKE
060100092	I WENT OUT LAST
060100100	WOMEN SAY THOSE THINGS BUT NEVER DO THEM
060100101	THESE VISITED SHE RETURNED
060100105	IT IS SO NATURE IS MADE
060100124	AS I COULD
060100128	SOME OF THE MEN WHERE TALKING AWAY THE TABLES
060100132	MY DAUGHTER YOU MUST RETURN TO YOUR PLACE
060100147	IT WAS MY LAST WEEK THERE
060100154	HE LOOKED AROUND HIM AND BEGAN
060100159	THE OTHER HAVE ALL RETURN
060100164	AND HE WENT BACK FOR MORE
060480005	FOR THESE HE TOOK THE MONEY
060480008	WHAT DID YOU NOT LET ASK KNOW
060480012	IT OFTEN HAPPENS SO IN LIFE
060480018	BUT YOU SIDE JUST NOW
060480037	WHAT IS THERE SUCH A PLACE
060480050	I HAD HIT HIM AT LEST
060480082	LET US GO SET SHOE
060480084	HE STOPPED IN HIS WALK AND LOOKED AROUND
060480090	SHE CAME UP TO MY WITH MY SISTER
060480094	SHE DID EVERYTHING SO WELL
060480102	HE THEN WENT AWAY
060480104	AND SO HER LIFE WAS ONE OF LOVE
060480131	LITTLE BY LITTLE THE BOYS BEGAN TALKING AGAIN
060480134	SHE MAY BE PHONE
060480135	SHE WENT BACK INTO THE LIE LIBRARY
060480145	WHAT DID YOU WANT TO SEE ME ABOUT
060480147	WERE STAY AT NINE
060480148	DECIDE IT WHO CAN I CANNOT
060480168	HE KIT ME BY THE ARM
060480169	FOURTEEN FEEL AWAY AND THAT LEFT ONE
061210013	HOW COULD SHE HAVE THOUGHT THEM
061210031	NOW IT CAME TO ME
061210059	BUT HE THOUGHT BETTER OF IT
061210060	THEY HAD NO ENOUGH SPORT FOR ONE DAY
061210063	VERY WELL I HAVE NO MORE QUESTIONS TO ASK
061210068	I TOOK MY HEAD IN MY HANDS AND THOUGHT
061210069	AFTER A TIME HE TOOK UP HIS STORY
061210071	WHAT MORE DID SHE SAY
061210075	GOT THAT HAVE YOU
061210086	HE DID IT FOR ME
061210095	THAT MADE ALL THE DIFFERENCE
061210109	I PASS HALF MY LIFE IN THE WOODS
061210128	DO I NEED TO TELL YOU THAT I WONDER
061210129	OF COURSE I KNOW THAT ALL THIS IS VERY SERIOUS
061210140	HISTORY IT IS NOT
061210141	THE PRETTY NURSE LOOKED QUITE SORRY
061210142	HE TOOK UP A BOOK
061210147	MEN HOPED AND WERE AFRAID TO HOPE
061210148	AND DID YOU HEAR NOTHING
061210174	EVERYONE STARTED WITH SURPRISE
064010049	WHY BREAK EVERY TIE
064010056	THE CHILDREN PRESENTLY RETURNED
064010057	THE GIRL STOPED SHORT
064010066	OR WHY DID NOT JOB GO
064010067	THE HAND JUST WHERE HE WISHED
064010086	PROUD OLD FAMILIES I GUESS
064010092	CAMPED AT OUR OLD PLACE
064010093	AND THEN MY AUNT USE TO CRY
064010103	SHE STAMPS HER FOOT
064010107	OUR TRIP BEGAN BADLY
064010109	WOULD SHE WIN HIM
064010120	KNOWING CAME BY SEEING
064010123	PRESENTLY THE SNOW CAME
064010135	LIVELY NOW LIVELY MEN
064010141	THREE MEN IN RED COAT CAME
064010150	THE BOX WAS LARGE AND IMPORTANT NEAR THE STAGE
064010161	I WENT TO THE SEA WORLD TO SEE BEAUTIFUL FISHES
064010164	ALL MEN JUMPPED THEIR HANDS
064010172	AN EXAMPLE MUST BE MADE
064010173	MINUTE AFTER MINUTE WENT BY
065040005	WE CANNOT TAKE FROM THEM WHAT THEY HAVE NOT GOT
065040007	THEN SHE TURNED AND WENT
065040009	THERE IS ALREADY A PRETTY LARGER COLLECTION
065040011	I DID NOT GO NEAR THE TREE
065040028	I DO NOT WONDER AT HER FLYING FROM HIM
065040042	FOR YEARS THIS WENT ON
065040044	YOUR MOTHER WILL RIDE HOME WITH ME
065040045	SHE WENT OUT WITH DIRTY CAPS
065040049	YOU MUST DECIDE FOR YOURSELF
065040077	SO THEY WENT INTO THE LIBRARY
065040112	YOU FOLLOW MY MEANING
065040118	HOW ON EARTH DID HE GET THERE
065040124	THIS IS BECAUSE THEY EAT MEN
065040125	I ASK FOR THE LAST TIME
065040126	I WENT UP TO HIM
065040127	I TOOK THE BOOK FROM HER
065040133	WITH THAT FOR A START ALL MAY BE LEARNED
065040134	SHE HAD TO CHOOSE WHAT TO SAY
065040137	SHE DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO SAY
065040160	HE MADE IT HIS HOME
069120003	AND SHE TURNED AND WENT AWAY WITHOUT A WORD
069120014	WE ENTERED THE ROOM
069120020	AFTER ALL WHAT DID IT MATTER
069120025	BUT IT DID NOT COME
069120052	AND THEN WHAT DID SHE DO
069120059	THEY DID NOT SEE THEM ANY MORE
069120061	HOW WELL DID I KNOW HER
069120072	IT TURNED US TO SILK
069120083	MY FRIENDS FOUND WATER
069120087	SO PRETTY AND SO YOUNG
069120092	TOGETHER THEY HELD HIM UP
069120093	I GOT UP AND CROSSED THE ROOM TO HIM
069120094	SHE WANTED TO QUESTION HIM
069120106	THEN I TOOK HIS CHILD THERE
069120121	I WOULD NOT MYSELF SAY THAT IT IS SO
069120123	DID I PLEASE YOU
069120140	HE STOOD AWAY FROM HER IN HIS SHAME
069120151	SHE HELD HER HAND TO HIM
069120165	SHE MADE ME BETTER LAST NIGHT
069120170	BUT WE HAVE LOST THE BEST OF MEN
070010001	IT WAS GOOD FOR ME
070010002	WE HAVE CLIMBED ONE STEP UP THE LADDER
070010003	PLUS THE KIDS REALLY LIKE THE DOGS
070010004	EVEN WHEN WE LOSE IT USUALLY A VERY CLOSE GAME
070010005	MOSTLY THE AMERICAN COMMUNITY IN EUROPE FOLLOWS THE GAME
070010006	WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT WAS SPORTS IN GENERAL
070010007	WAY TO HELP US ALL OUT
070010008	LOVELY TO MAKE YOUR ACQUAINTANCE SIR
070010009	SUCCESSFUL FIRST DAY FOR COLLEGE
070010010	THIS IS A PRETTY GOOD PLACE TO START
070010011	LOVE IS A STRONG MAN IN THE MIDDLE
070010012	SOMEBODY LET ME KNOW WHEN IT'S OVER
070010013	YOU PUT IT ON WRONG
070010014	COMPETITION IS GOOD FOR THE INDUSTRY
070010015	SHE LOOKED ANXIOUSLY AT THE HOUSE AND STARTED
070010016	THEY MAY MAKE ME MORE UNHAPPY THAN I AM
070010017	SHE WOULD BE SORRY FOR HIS DEATH
070010018	MY PEOPLE WILL BRING YOU TO THE SHIP
070010019	IT WAS A PROOF OF HIS FRIENDSHIP
070010020	I FOUND I HAD NO NEED TO THINK
075510004	I SHALL END BY FALLING IN LOVE WITH HER
075510010	IT LOOKED LIKE ONE OF ALARM TO ME
075510017	YOU SAY YOU ARE A BUSINESS MAN
075510036	WE WISH ALL MAY TAKE WORRYING BY BUS
075510038	IF SO HAD YOU NOT BETTER SHOW IT
075510041	NOT ANYONE BUT YOU
075510057	HE CAN STILL BE SAVED
075510076	IS THERE ANYTHING MORE BEFORE I GO OUT
075510086	HE PUT IT BACK IN HIS POCKET
075510090	I COULD NEVER APPEAR BRIGHT BEFORE THE WORLD AGAIN
075510091	TO BEEN THING I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND
075510099	AT NIGHT I DREAM MY HANDS
075510129	WHEN IS THERE LETTER TO GO I WONDER
075510131	HE SPENDS A LOT OF TIME RUSHING ABOUT IN IT
075510137	BUT THERE WAS SOMEONE ELSE
075510142	THE WATER WAS WRONG AND WE HAD GREAT FUN
075510144	SHE WAS BETWEEN SIXTEEN AND SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD
075510163	NOTHING WILL PUT AN END OF TO HIM
075510165	I THINK I CAN GUESSED AT THE PERSON
075510167	I HUNT ALL OVER THE TOWN TO FIND IT
080020001	BUT THAT'S ANOTHER STORY ALTOGETHER
080020002	IT WAS VERY VERY STRANGE
080020003	NATIONALLY THOUGH THE TREND IS BEGINNING TO TURN UPWARD AGAIN
080020004	WORRY IS PART OF LIFE
080020005	NO NEED FOR A DOCK
080020006	TIME FOR A BIT OF HONOR
080020007	CHECK OUT FOR THE WIN
080020008	IT'S GOING TO BE A BUSY WEEK
080020009	I HAVE NO ONE BUT MYSELF TO BLAMES FOR THIS
080020010	WHAT A PERFECT ENDING TO THE DAY
080020011	LOVING LIFE AND ALL THE PEOPLE IN MINE
080020012	COOL FOR HIM TO STICK UP FOR HER
080020013	DEPENDS ON A NUMBER OF THINGS
080020014	THAT WAS HEAD TO SAY
080020015	WANT TO GO FOR A WALK
080020016	CHEERS TO A GREAT GROUP
080020017	FIRST PLACE IN THE DIVISION
080020018	MOVE THE STAR WITH MORE MOVES
080020019	IT'S BEING USED TO MAKE MORE MONEY
080020020	IT WAS DIFFICULT TO GET THERE
080570004	YOURS IS A PRETTY BUSINESS
080570009	DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING OF IT
080570013	BUT SURELY THERE IS DANGER
080570014	THEN COMES A BLANK IN THE PAPER
080570031	IT SEEMED ALL THAT HE COULD DO TO SPEAK
080570053	RUNNING BY ME BEATING MY ME
080570067	HOW SHALL I DESCRIBE WHAT WE SAW
080570071	AT LEAST I SHALL BE WITH MY OWN PEOPLE
080570072	DRESS THEM IN BLACK AND PLACE THEM OUTSIDE MY TENT
080570080	IF PEOPLE LAUGHED AT HER SHE LAUGHED WITH THEM
080570081	YES I AM A ROMANTIC
080570087	AT LEAST HE COULD KNOW
080570089	SHE HAD STORED THEM IN HER OWN ROOM
080570102	IS NOT EVERY MAN ABLE TO SAY WHAT HE LIKES
080570127	THE DREAM WAS QUITE AT AN END
080570138	SHE STOPPED FOR A MOMENT
080570143	IT WAS A FINE NIGHT AND PRESENTLY THE MOON APPEARED
080570144	GET YOUR UNCLE AND AUNT TO ASK HER DOWN
080570146	HOW IS HE GETTING ALONG THIS MORNING
080570157	THE LAND WAS STILL LONELY
085850006	COME DOWN TO ME AS SOON AS YOU CAN
085850024	ALL IN GOOD TIME MY DEAR
085850039	SHE SEEMED TO BE QUIET READY FOR THIS
085850042	WE BUY SOME NICE A CLOTHES FOR OUR SALES
085850044	YOU SAW HER ALSO I BELIEVE
085850046	YET SHE LET IT BE
085850056	THAT'S WHAT IT IS TO KNOW HOW TO PAINT
085850075	THE CHILD WAS STILL CRYING
085850088	NO ONE WILL REMEMBER YOU
085850092	THE THIRD BLOW WAS THE ONE THAT KILLED IT
085850094	THE HALL WAS VERY QUIET
085850101	PUT YOU FOOT DOWN TOO
085850108	THE WHOLE THING WAS FAR TOO REAL FOR DREAMING
085850112	NOT TO BE ABLE TO GET OUT
085850119	FOR I WAS NOT YET SAFE
085850120	HOW LONG AGO THAT SEEMED
085850138	AS OF US WE COULD HAVE SHOUTED ALONG
085850146	THEY WILL BE SURE IF ANY
085850161	I HAVE COME TO ASK HIM A FEW QUESTIONS
085850170	NEVER SAW ANYTHING LIKE IT NEVER IN MY LIFE
090340002	ALL THE REST YOU WILL SEE LATER FOR YOURSELF
090340007	OFFER HIM THAT FROM ME AND COME
090340021	BUT YOUR FRIENDS ARE PROUD AND RICH
090340032	NO CREATURE EVER WANTED SO MUCH TO LIVE
090340039	BUT THERE WAS TROUBLE ENOUGH AT THE OTHER END
090340041	THIS IS THE STUFF TO PUT LIFE IN YOU
090340043	WHAT ABOUT THAT LETTER YOU WERE SPEAKING OF AT BREAKFAST
090340054	AND THEIR HANDS MIGHT JOIN
090340071	USE ME LIKE A STAFF
090340085	I BY NO MEANS WISH TO DIE
090340088	YOU CAN SEE THE REST
090340090	BUT WHAT ELSE HAD HE A RIGHT TO EXPECT
090340108	I HAVE MY OWN PLAN
090340114	I ASKED WAS THE CAUSE OF THE TROUBLE WAS
090340126	I AM NO LONGER A PARTNER IN THE HOUSE
090340131	IT WAS MY SECRET AND HERS
090340155	BUT IN THIS WORLD WE MUST CONSIDER OTHERS
090340158	NOT ALL THAT MUCH ANYWAY
090340164	HAVE YOU HAD SIGHT OF ANYTHING
090340168	THEY REMAINED THREE HOURS AT TABLE TELLING ABOUT THEIR SPORT
090700006	HE COULD NOT SEE HIMSELF
090700008	ONE TWICE AND THE THIRD TIME DEATH
090700019	I MUST START AT ONCE
090700042	I WOULD NOT HAVE HIM BACK AGAIN IF I COULD
090700045	AN IMPORTANT PRODUCT SUCH AS THIS
090700047	MIGHT I ASK YOUR NAME
090700054	HOWEVER THERE'S NO HELP FOR IT
090700055	WOULD IT NOT BE POSSIBLE TO FIND SUCH
090700057	HERE WE ARE THEN ALL SEATED ROUND THE TABLE
090700059	IN CHURCH AND WAITING ON TRAINS LIKE
090700065	THIS WAS THE PLAN THAT SUGGESTED ITSELF
090700081	THEY ARE OUT OF THE REACH OF ACCIDENT
090700082	THEY LIVED ON PUBLIC DEATH
090700108	HE MIGHT MARRY A GIRL WITH MONEY
090700111	AT LAST HOWEVER THE PARTY WAS MADE UP
090700117	I AM AFRAID HE WILL LEAVE US WITHOUT PITY
090700127	THIS SHALL BE THE PRICE OF HIS LIFE
090700148	THE COUNTRY IS PLEASANT FOR EXERCISE
090700164	I HAD AN APPOINTMENT HERE AT HALF PAST NIGHT
090700172	I THINK WE SHOULD BUILD GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM
095560005	I WANT TO BE ON THE SPOT TO HELP
095560008	HE MUST CONSIDER WHAT TO DO NEXT
095560010	SHALL I FEET HIM DOWN
095560017	MY FATHER THINKS TO PAINT THEM
095560031	NOTHING COULD TRUE HIM FROM HIS PURPOSE
095560037	DO NOT BE ANXIOUS ALL IS WHERE
095560051	HOWEVER HE PULLED HIMSELF TOGETHER QUICKLY
095560054	HOW PLEASANT HER MANNER IS
095560069	THE HANDS POINTED FOR FOUR OH CLOTH
095560080	DO NOT EXPECT SO MUCH FOR MY KINDNESS
095560083	HOWEVER I KNOW WHAT HIS ADVICE JUST NOW WOULD BE
095560108	THESE WORDS CHEERED ME UP
095560115	WE SHELL HAVE A SOME TROUBLE
095560129	THERE WILL PROBABLY BE NONE
095560133	HE AND HIS BROTHER SEEMED TO CHANGE PLACES
095560150	HE WAS NOT A PROPER PARTNER FOR HER
095560153	I THOUGHT IT MIGHT HAVE A REACHED YOUR AIRS
095560163	I MIGHT AS WELL GO
095560164	WHEN I SEE IT REACH YOUR HAND I FINE
095560170	OH HOW PAINFUL ALL THIS IS
096000002	BUT IT IS STILL ONLY THE FIRST QUARTER
096000003	AND FOR ALL YOU KNOW YOU COULD BE RIGHT
096000004	WE ARE GOING TO KILL THEM BUT NOT THAT WAY
096000005	I HAVE LOOKED WITH MY VERY EYES ON HELL
096000006	IT WAS LIKE THEY WERE LOST OR SOMETHING
096000007	HE MADE NO MOVE IT WOULD COME WHAT WOULD COME
096000008	HE WAS THERE WHEN HIS BEST FRIEND ASKED HER OUT
096000009	WHAT WAS HE EVEN ABOUT TO SAY
096000010	I THOUGHT I WOULD NEVER SMILE AGAIN
096000011	YOU AND I WANT THE SAME THING
096000012	THIS WAS THE MAN WHO HAD KILLED HIS FATHER
096000013	THEN I SAW HIM AT ONCE
096000014	I MUST HAVE WALKED INTO IT
096000015	HE PUT HIS OTHER HAND ON THE WALL AS WELL
096000016	BUT I WAS YOUNG THEN AND A LITTLE TOO CURIOUS
096000017	SHE'S LEFT ME HERE TO FACE HIM ON MY OWN
096000018	SHE OPENED THE DOOR AND LOOKED AROUND THE BATHROOM
096000020	I DO THOUGH AND I AM TRYING TO MAKE DO
096000021	IT WAS NOT LIKE SHE HAD ANY POWER OVER ANYTHING
096000022	SHE SHOULD BE THERE IN ABOUT AN HOUR
096040001	HE JUMPED UP BUT ALL WAS STILL ABOUT HIM
096040002	SHE TURNED AND LOOKED AT HER OTHER FRIENDS
096040004	IT IS ONLY FOR YOU
096040005	THEY WOULD NEVER ACCEPT ME AS A GIRL
096040006	I COULD SEE THAT HIS HANDS WERE SHAKING TOO
096040007	SOON YOU WILL HAVE TO GO OUT ON YOUR OWN
096040008	THERE WAS NO ONE LEFT
096040009	THIS WAS NOT MY DAY
096040010	YOU JUST KNOW THAT IT MAKES YOU FEEL GOOD RIGHT
096040011	I WONDER WHAT WAS GOING ON OVER THERE
096040012	SO ARE YOU HERE TO PLAY WITH ME
096040014	IF YOU WANT TO PROVE SOMETHING THEN DO IT
096040015	THAT WAS WHEN HE SAW IT
096040016	THE MAN RUBBED HIS EYES AND LOOKED INTO IT AGAIN
096040018	AND PUT A HAND DOWN TO HELP HIM UP
096040019	THEY WALKED SLOWLY TO THE VERY END OF IT
096040021	WHAT WAS HE DOING AT THIS MOMENT
096040023	I AM RICH AND SO WAS MY FATHER BEFORE ME
096040024	SHE WAS LOOKING FOR A BREATH OF LIFE
096040025	THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE GAINED BY IT
096060001	HE HAD COME OUT ON JOBS WITH ME BEFORE
096060002	I JUST LOOK AT HIM
096060003	THE TWO OF YOU WILL NEED IT
096060004	BUT SHE IS MY LIFE
096060005	IN HIS EYES HE ONLY SAW HER
096060006	WE DO NOT WANT THAT TO HAPPEN NOW DO WE
096060007	I LOOKED OVER THEM ALL
096060008	THERE IS NO HOPE FOR ANY OF US HERE
096060009	IT WAS AN AWFUL THING YET WHAT COULD HE DO
096060010	YOU THOUGHT THE DREADFUL PLACE HAD YOU ONCE MORE
096060011	I LET THE TIME GET AWAY FROM ME
096060012	HE OPENED UP THE DOOR
096060013	THEY HAD A LITTLE GIRL
096060014	I TURNED TO GO THE OTHER WAY
096060015	SHE WANTED TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THIS
096060016	THIS IS WHEN ALL OF THE GUARDS BUT ONE LEFT
096060017	HE MUST TURN AROUND TO SEE IF IT IS HER
096060019	I SHOULD NEVER DO IT AGAIN
096060020	I ASKED AS HE MADE A LONG PAUSE
096060022	THAT WAS ALL SHE NEEDED TO DO RIGHT
096070002	BUT THERE WAS NO ONE COMING HIS WAY
096070003	HE WOULD DO IT FOR THEM YES FOR THEM
096070005	I COULD TELL THEY WERE PLOTTING SOMETHING BUT WHAT
096070006	IT WAS ALWAYS ABOUT HIM
096070007	I AM NOT HAPPY WITH YOU RIGHT NOW
096070008	THEY THOUGHT SHE WAS GOING TO WALK OUT AGAIN
096070011	I LIKE TO SEE A MAN ENJOY HIMSELF
096070012	WE ARE LOOKING FOR YOU
096070013	THE OTHER TURNED BACK TO THE DOOR SHAKING HIS HEAD
096070014	HE WALKED INTO THE ROOM HE HAD JUMPED FROM
096070015	HE THEN ASKED ME IF I WAS AN ENGLISHMAN
096070016	THAT WAS WHEN SHE SAW IT
096070017	SHE HAD HER HAND OVER HER LEFT CHECK
096070018	THIS IS THE END OF THE FIRST CHAPTER
096070019	IT WAS TOO MUCH TO TAKE
096070020	APART FROM THAT I HAVE VERY LITTLE TO SAY
096070021	HE STILL HAD TO MAKE IT THROUGH THE NIGHT
096070022	SHE STOPPED TO LOOK DOWN ON HIM
096070023	HE TURNED AROUND AND LOOKED AT ME WHAT
096070024	SHE WAS NOTHING BUT A MURDERER AFTER ALL
096090001	IF HE WAS CALLED UP AGAIN HE WOULD GO AGAIN
096090003	THE GIRL THEN LOOKED AT HER HAND
096090005	WHAT WILL THEY DO IF SOMETHING HAPPENS TO ME
096090006	WE HAVE THE BEST PEOPLE ON THIS
096090007	IT WAS AS MUCH AS MY LIFE WAS WORTH
096090008	THERE WAS NO WAY TO TELL FOR SURE
096090010	I WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED BUT NOT NOW
096090011	I COULD JUST BARELY SEE IT FROM HERE
096090014	I MADE HIM LOOK ME INTO THE EYES
096090015	THIS IS NOT GOING TO WORK
096090017	I WAS COMPLETELY IN MY OWN WORLD RIGHT NOW
096090018	THAT MUST NOT BE IT
096090019	I WAS FOUND BY THEM WHEN I WAS A BABY
096090020	BUT EVEN THAT IS PUTTING HER WILL FIRST
096090021	SO I WILL MAKE A BARGAIN WITH YOU
096090023	I HAVE WATCHED YOU LONG ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT
096090024	SHE HAD ALWAYS THOUGHT OF ME AS AN ENEMY
096090025	BUT WHERE WAS SHE THAT SHE SEEMED SO ABSENT
096090026	HE WAS AT A BETTER PLACE
096090027	SHE ACCEPTED IT AND PUT IT WITH HER THINGS
096110001	THEY JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE I WAS ALL RIGHT
096110002	HE COULD SEE IT WISH HE COULD NOT
096110003	BUT THE EYES WERE THE THING
096110004	AND A GIRL AT THAT
096110005	IT IS YOU WHO IS NO MATCH FOR ME
096110006	YOU GET TO DO THIS JOB ON YOUR OWN
096110008	NO ONE HAD TO KNOW
096110009	I SAY AS I TAKE OUT MY PAPERS
096110011	HE LEFT THEM THERE FOR A LONG TIME HANGING THERE
096110012	I BELIEVE WE SHOULD ALL COME WITH YOU
096110013	I THOUGHT ABOUT IT MORE
096110014	I HAD TO TURN MYSELF AROUND AND GO BACK
096110015	I TURNED TO LOOK BEHIND ME AND SAW NOTHING
096110016	IT WAS THE JAPANESE MAN FROM THE OTHER NIGHT
096110017	HE SEEMED MADE TO LIVE WITH NO ONE BUT HIMSELF
096110018	THIS WAS GOING TO BE A GOOD FIGHT
096110019	WHY WOULD SHE WANT HIM IN THE FIRST PLACE
096110021	BUT THAN THERE WAS STILL HER FATHER
096110022	WHAT ELSE IS THERE TO DO HERE
096110023	BUT I THINK HE MIGHT BE A LITTLE MORE ENTHUSIASTIC
096130001	I WANTED TO SEE THE WORLD
096130002	THAT WAS ALL HE COULD THINK
096130003	HE LOOKED AT HER FOR A LONG TIME
096130004	AND WHAT OF THAT MAN
096130005	SHE HAD LOVED BEFORE BUT NOT LIKE THIS
096130006	BUT SHE WOULD BE BACK
096130007	THERE IS NO PLACE FOR ME IN HIS HEART
096130008	I KEEP MY EYES ON HIM
096130009	IT SOUNDED AS IF HE WERE GOING TO SAY MORE
096130010	THE BEST ONE I HAVE
096130011	I JUST NEED TO GO THERE
096130012	THEN SHE SAW THE WAY OUT
096130013	HE THOUGHT ABOUT SOMETHING AND THEN HE ASKED
096130014	HE WAS HE ADMITTED NEVER VERY GOOD WITH HIS HANDS
096130016	I HAVE A GUN TO YOUR HEAD RIGHT NOW
096130017	AND HERE YOU ARE AND YOU ARE SO PRETTY
096130018	I WALKED INTO THE ROOM MY HAND ON HER SHOULDER
096130019	HE TURNED AROUND TO FACE HER
096130020	THE FIRST THING IS TO GET HIM AWAY
096130021	I LOOK UP AT THE HOUSE
096140002	I NEVER THOUGHT YOU WOULD BE ONE FOR THE SUBURBS
096140003	AND THERE WAS A STRANGE LOOK IN HER EYES
096140004	THE STUDENT THEN TURNED HIS HEAD AND LOOKED AT ME
096140005	BUT THAT IS WHY WE ARE HERE
096140006	SHE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS
096140007	IT WAS SOME TIME BEFORE HE COULD SEE ANYTHING
096140008	THERE WAS NO WAY THEY SAW HIM
096140009	NO I DO NOT OWN THEM
096140010	THEY WERE UP TO SOMETHING
096140011	YOU COULD ALWAYS TELL WHAT WAS ON MY MIND
096140012	I ASKED AS SHE CLOSED THE DOOR
096140014	HE WILL COME BACK IN A LITTLE WHILE
096140015	HE WALKED AROUND TO THE OTHER SIDE OF HER BED
096140016	THAT WAS THE FIRST THING ABOUT HER THAT ATTRACTED ME
096140017	I MUST HAVE AN END PUT TO ALL THIS
096140018	IF NOT HOW SHOULD THEY KNOW HE WAS DEAD
096140019	WHAT ELSE WOULD I WANT TO HAVE
096140020	HE LOOKED OVER HIS HAND AND SMILED
096140021	I AM THE ONE WHO MADE YOU
096140022	I WOULD LOVE FOR US TO STAY THERE ONCE AGAIN
096150003	I ASKED WITH A SMILE ON MY FACE
096150005	BUT SHE HAD LEFT THAT LIFE BEHIND NOW TOO
096150006	THERE WAS NO WAY SOMETHING LIKE THIS COULD BE REALITY
096150007	SHE HAD MADE UP HER MIND IN ALL GOOD FAITH
096150009	THEY WERE GOING TO SEND HER BACK IN TIME
096150010	THE WOMAN TURNED HER HEAD TO LOOK OUT THE WINDOW
096150011	THIS GIRL SHE WAS EVERYTHING I NEVER WAS
096150012	THERE WAS ONCE AGAIN SILENCE SO I LET IT BE
096150013	I HAVE TO GO SAY HI TO SOME MORE PEOPLE
096150016	HE THEN LOOKED DOWN AT HIS HANDS
096150017	I HAD VERY LITTLE OF MY OWN
096150018	HE ONE THE OTHER HAND WAS DIFFERENT
096150019	I HAVE NO PLACE IN YOUR HEART
096150020	IT WAS AN AFFAIR THAT BUT OF A MOMENT
096150021	I LOOKED INTO HER EYES AND FOUND THE TRUTH
096150024	IT WAS THE LITERATURE OF LOVE NOT OF THE LOVE
096150025	I WAS VERY NERVOUS FOR A LONG TIME AFTER THIS
096150026	I ACTUALLY OPENED MY EYES AND SAW WHERE I WAS
096150027	HE WAS EVER THE SAME TO ME
096150028	SHE MUST BE COMING FOR ME AGAIN
096160001	HE LOOKED UP AND SAW A MAN
096160002	ALL OF YOU WILL BE THERE
096160003	SHE COULD JUST SEE IT
096160004	BUT NO WAY TO FIND WHAT THEY NEED
096160005	THE FIRST ONE WAS HIS EYES
096160006	THERE WERE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE CARRIAGE WITH THEM
096160007	YOU CAN GO BACK TO THE STORY NOW
096160008	I DROPPED MY HAND AND PUT IT ON MY SIDE
096160009	AND TO THINK I COULD GET AWAY FROM WORK
096160010	THEY OPENED THE DOOR AND WALKED IN
096160011	IT'S A GOOD THING NO ONE WAS AROUND THE PLACE
096160012	IF YOU ARE GOING TO COME IN THEN COME IN
096160013	I WANT TO FEEL YOU MORE AND MORE
096160014	NOW I COULD NEVER DO ANY OF THAT AGAIN
096160015	I WOULD LIKE TO LIVE A LONG LIFE
096160016	I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT THROUGH
096160017	IT SEEMED THAT WAS WHERE IT WAS COMING FROM
096160018	HE WOULD NOT LET THE CONVENTION END LIKE THIS
096160019	BUT EVEN THIS WAS AS NOTHING
096160020	HE STARTED TO ASK IF I WAS ALL RIGHT
096190001	HE WANTED TO DO THIS RIGHT
096190002	BUT THERE WAS NO ONE
096190003	AND YOU OF ALL PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW
096190004	HOW COULD HE JUST FIND ME LIKE THAT
096190005	THEN SHE OPENED HER EYES AND LOOKED AT HER WATCH
096190006	IT IS WHAT HE WOULD WANT
096190007	THE GIRL SEEMED TO SEE THEM FOR THE FIRST TIME
096190008	THERE WAS NOTHING HERE TO GO ON
096190009	YOU REALLY THINK YOU ARE GOING TO DEFEAT ME
096190010	BUT IT WILL GET BETTER
096190011	THAT WAS THE WAY OUT
096190012	HE HAD INDEED COME ON MORE THAN HE THOUGHT
096190013	BUT WE WERE STILL THE BEST OF FRIENDS
096190014	THIS IS THE ONLY PLACE WHERE YOU WILL BE SAFE
096190015	THERE WAS ANOTHER LITTLE THING HE HAD TO SAY
096190016	HE ASKED AS HE PUT HIS ARM AROUND HER
096190017	WHAT ELSE WAS THERE LEFT TO DO
096190019	AND YET HOW INDIFFERENT IT ALL WAS TO ME NOW
096190020	AND THE WORLD IS OVER
096190021	I NEED TO MAKE IT
096240001	SHE WAS NEVER THE SAME
096240002	I ASKED THEM HOW DO I GET THERE
096240003	HE JUST TURNED AND LEFT
096240004	IT SEEMED THAT HE HAD
096240005	AND SHE AGAIN LOOKED DOWN FOR A MOMENT
096240006	THE PEOPLE BEHIND ME WERE NOT GOING TO LET UP
096240007	THAT IS THE WAY WE MUST BE IN THIS BUSINESS
096240008	BUT NO ONE WAS LOOKING AT HIM
096240009	YOU COULD TELL IT ON HIS FACE
096240010	THE END OF HER TIME WITH HER FRIENDS
096240011	THEY COULD ALL SEE IT NOW
096240012	THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT THE WOMAN THAT MADE HIM UNEASY
096240013	I WALKED OUT THE DOOR
096240014	IF SO THE SOONER HE WAS BACK THERE THE BETTER
096240015	BUT NOTHING HAPPENED TO ME I OPENED MY EYES
096240016	I HAD TO LOOK AWAY
096240017	I PUT MY HAND IN FRONT OF HER
096240019	IT WAS THE LAST THING HE COULD GIVE HER
096240020	SHE IS ON HER OWN WORLD
096240021	SHE HAD MORE THAN ONCE TO REMIND HIM OF THIS
096250001	AND I NEED YOU TO HELP ME
096250002	SHE TURNED AROUND AND LOOKED HIM IN THE EYES
096250003	IT WAS ALL HE COULD DO
096250004	THEY WOULD NOT KNOW IT
096250005	THERE WILL BE AN END OF THAT NOW
096250007	BUT OF ONE THING SHE IS SURE
096250008	YOU HAVE A GIRL WITH YOU
096250009	THIS WAS WHAT THEY WERE LOOKING FOR
096250010	THE MAN WALKED TO THE WOMAN
096250011	BUT THERE WAS SO MUCH MORE TO COME
096250012	AND HE WAS STILL THAT LITTLE BOY
096250013	I HAD NO WHERE ELSE TO GO
096250014	I KNOW YOU WANT TO GIVE ME A GOOD LIFE
096250015	HE ASKED ALL OF US
096250016	I JUST HAD A LONG DAY
096250017	NO ONE WAS IN THE ROOM
096250018	HE LOOKED TO HIS SIDE AND SMILED
096250020	HOW MUCH WOULD THEY KNOW OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED
096250021	SO ENJOY AND TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK OF IT
096250023	THEN SHE TURNED TO HIM
096280011	YOU WILL HAND HIM OVER TO ME
096280012	HE WAS A GOOD MAN THOUGH
096280013	I WANT YOU AND YOU ARE COMING BACK WITH US
096280014	I SMILED AND WALKED OUT THE DOOR
096280015	I WANTED TO SEE WHO SHE WAS
096280016	AND HE PUT IT AGAIN
096280017	WHAT DO I HAVE TO SAY FOR MYSELF
096280018	THIS WAS NOT RIGHT NOT RIGHT AT ALL
096280019	I AM SURE YOU KNOW IT
096280020	I CAN TAKE THEM OFF IF YOU NEED ME TO
096280021	I SAW AT ONCE HOW IT WAS
096280022	AND THERE IT STOPPED FOR A MOMENT
096280023	NO ONE WOULD GET THE BEST OF HIM
096280024	ALL THAT KIND OF THING WAS NOTHING TO HIM NOW
096280025	THE PERSON LOOKED AT THE BACK
096280026	SHE LOOKED HARD AT THE MAN
096280027	NOW THAT HE HAD THE TIME
096280028	BUT WHAT ELSE AM I TO DO
096280029	HE HAD TO GO THROUGH WITH IT
096280030	THERE IT WAS RIGHT NEXT TO HIM
096300001	HOW WAS I GOING TO GET OUT OF HERE
096300002	HE LOOKED BACK AT HER
096300003	AND YOU LIKE IT THAT WAY
096300004	BUT THIS IS NOT WHAT SHE HAD WANTED
096300005	THEY ARE ONE IN THE SAME
096300006	SHE SMILED AND WALKED WITH HIM
096300007	THERE IS NO NEED TO GO THERE
096300008	SO WHAT THEN WERE WE TO DO
096300009	I THINK I WILL RIGHT NOW
096300010	YOU LOOK OVER AND YOU SEE A BOY
096300011	I SAW YOU TAKE THEM
096300012	I THOUGHT TO MYSELF AS I MADE UP MY MIND
096300013	THAT IS THEY WOULD IF I HAD ANY FRIENDS
096300014	THIS TIME IT WAS A WOMAN
096300015	I TURNED AROUND TO FACE IT
096300016	IT WAS THE ONLY ROOM WITH THE DOOR STILL CLOSED
096300017	AND IT JUST MIGHT BE
096300018	I LEFT HER AT HOME
096300019	HE LOOKED AWAY FROM IT
096300020	BUT IT WAS EVEN SO
096340004	BUT AT THE END WHAT DO WE GET
096340005	THERE WAS NO WAY OUT OF THIS ROOM
096340006	THAT HAD TO BE IT THEN
096340007	IT IS A HAND ON MY
096340008	HE WILL WANT ME JUST FOR ME
096340009	THEY TURNED ALL TO HIM
096340010	AND I LIKE HER EYES
096340011	BUT HERE NOW HE REALLY WAS
096340012	THE OTHER ONE WAS BACK IT WAS TIME AGAIN
096340013	YOU ASKED TO SEE IT
096340014	I JUST WANTED TO GO UP THERE
096340015	I CAN ONLY DO IT ONCE
096340016	BUT HOW ARE YOU GOING TO HELP IT
096340017	HE WALKED OVER TO THE DOOR AND OPENED IT
096340018	THERE WAS SO MUCH MORE TO IT THAN THAT
096340019	I LOOKED AROUND BUT I STILL FOUND NO ONE
096340020	I KNOW THAT THEY WILL NOT LET ME DOWN
096340021	THIS WAS THE GOOD SIDE TO IT
096340022	I NEVER SAW HIM LOOKING LIKE THAT
096340023	WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING WITH HIM
096390001	I WAS BACK IN THE ROOM
096390002	SHE LOOKED UP AT ME AND SMILED
096390003	HE WOULD NEVER DO THIS
096390004	WHAT COULD YOU DO WITH A GIRL
096390005	AND SHE HAD TO BE LIKE HIM
096390006	BUT HE WAS STILL THERE
096390007	YOU JUST HAVE TO MAN
096390008	I WANT TO FIND OUT WHAT THEY CAN DO
096390009	HE SAW NO NEED OF IT
096390010	THERE WAS BUT ONE THING LEFT TO DO
096390011	THEY ALL TURNED TO ME
096390012	I THINK I WANTED TO SEE HIM AGAIN
096390013	HE LOOKED TO HIS LEFT THEN TO HIS RIGHT
096390014	I HAD TO GO TO MY PLACE
096390015	IT WILL BE THE END OF THEM
096390016	THAT WAS ALL I WAS GOING TO SAY ABOUT IT
096390017	I WAS ON TO SOMETHING
096390018	SHE TURNED AROUND AND WALKED TO THE DOOR
096390019	I MADE IT JUST IN TIME
096390020	HE HAD NOTHING ELSE HE WANTED TO DO OUT HERE
096430002	SHE PRESENTED HIM WITH A ROSE
096430003	AT LAST OUR RANKS WERE BREAKING
096430004	NO SUCH LUCK GRACED HER HOWEVER
096430005	THE MACHINE MUST HAVE HELPED ME STAY AWAKE
096430006	THEY ALL JUMPED UP FROM THEIR SEATS SUDDENLY
096430007	IT'S NO PROBLEM SHE WAVED OFF
096430008	LET US BEGIN ON THOSE DEBTS
096430009	TO RESTORE YOUR LOST ENERGY
096430010	WE SHIFT BACK INTO SILENCE
096430011	HE NODDED SLOWLY AND IMPRESSIVELY
096430012	IT HAD VERY NEARLY COME
096430013	YOU KNOW THEY CAN PROBABLY DO THAT
096430014	A COOL ONE THIS GENERAL
096430015	MAYBE SOON BUT CERTAINLY NOT NOW

096430017	MY BREATH COMES IN IN SHARP PAINFUL BURSTS
096430018	SO EVERYONE WOULD BE SATISFIED
096430019	THIS FLOOR LOOKED REALLY RUN DOWN
096430020	IN FACT WE FOUND THEM EXCEEDINGLY USEFUL
096430021	TAKE OUT OR HOME COOKED
096450001	WHY WAS NATURE SO CRUEL
096450002	AT THE SAME TIME THE SAME FLOWER
096450003	DO YOU THINK ANYONE ELSE IS ALIVE OUT THERE
096450004	HE NEVER SHUT HIS EYES
096450005	I AM NOT A CHILD NOR YET A FOOL
096450006	FINALLY SHE TURNED AND FACED HIM
096450007	LET US INSTALL OURSELVES IN THIS HALL
096450008	YOU ARE MY HEART NOW
096450010	IT LOOKED PEACEFUL DELICATE ALMOST JAPANESE
096450011	THE SOLDIER STARED INTO SPACE MIND RACING FURIOUSLY
096450012	BETTER THAN OTHER GIRLS THAT'S FOR SURE
096450013	AND WHEN THEY GET WHAT THEY WANT THEY WANT MORE
096450014	NOT THAT THERE'S ANYTHING WRONG WITH YOUR THING
096450015	BUT SHE'S HERE HELPING ME
096450016	DEATH ITSELF HAD COME WITHOUT PAIN
096450017	REMOVAL OR LESSENING OF EITHER
096450018	HIS FATHER CALLED DOWN BELOW
096450019	A SILLY BUSINESS ON ALL SIDES
096450020	SHE STARTED EATING BEFORE GIVING HER OPINION
096450021	FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT NINE
096460002	A QUICK JUMP OVER THE WIDENING GAP SAVED HIM
096460003	HE DRIFTED OUT AND AWAY ALONG SUNSET TRACK
096460004	THE MOON WOULD NOT RISE TILL LATER
096460005	HIS FATHER HAZARDED ONE GUESS
096460006	WHEN HE RETURNED HE ASKED IF THEY WERE HUNGRY
096460007	BEING WITHOUT YOU MAKES ME VERY UNHAPPY
096460008	THOSE EYES COULD STOP BULLETS
096460009	SHE ALWAYS MAKE THEM MAD
096460010	WHAT HAD HAPPENED SINCE THEN
096460011	WAS IT MOVING AS AN AUTOMOBILE
096460012	ONE FURTHER REMARK HOWEVER LEFT HIS LIPS
096460013	WE MUST GET BETTER ACQUAINTED

096460015	BUT SOMETIMES LIFE CAN HURT
096460016	CHAPTER ONE FIRST DAY AT SCHOOL

096460019	WELL YOUR ABOUT HALF RIGHT
096460020	JUST WISHING EACH OTHER LUCK
096460021	AN ALMOST PAINFUL QUIET REIGNS
096490001	WAS I IN A HOSPITAL OR SOMETHING
096490002	HE LOOKED AROUND THE HOTEL RESTAURANT
096490003	BEST TO GIVE THEM WHAT THEY WANTED
096490004	NOTHING SHOWED THAT ANYTHING HAD OCCURRED
096490005	SHE WHISPERED ANGRY AT HER LOSS OF CONTROL
096490006	YOU CAN SLEEP HERE TONIGHT
096490007	THEY CLEARLY HAVE EVERYTHING THOUGHT THROUGH
096490008	A BROKEN LAND SITTING ON BROKEN GROUND
096490009	ONCE AGAIN HE HOPED IT WOULD LAST
096490010	NO SUCH THING AS TRUST
096490011	HER THIN WHITE FINGERS WERE GRIPPING ITS SIDES
096490012	IMAGINE TEN TIMES MORE DIRT
096490013	IN THIS MOMENT SHE IS HAPPY
096490014	WE KNOW WHERE YOU RUN
096490015	THINGS ARE MOVING ALONG SO FAST
096490016	THROUGH HEARING ONLY HIS VOICE
096490017	TWO BULLETS SHOT BUT MISSED
