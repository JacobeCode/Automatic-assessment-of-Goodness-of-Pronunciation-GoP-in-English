lbi-116-288045-0000 AS I APPROACHED THE CITY I HEARD BELLS RINGING AND A LITTLE LATER I FOUND THE STREETS ASTIR WITH THRONGS OF WELL DRESSED PEOPLE IN FAMILY GROUPS WENDING THEIR WAY HITHER AND THITHER
lbi-116-288045-0001 LOOKING ABOUT ME I SAW A GENTLEMAN IN A NEAT BLACK DRESS SMILING AND HIS HAND EXTENDED TO ME WITH GREAT CORDIALITY
lbi-116-288045-0002 HE MUST HAVE REALIZED I WAS A STRANGER AND WISHED TO TENDER HIS HOSPITALITY TO ME I ACCEPTED IT GRATEFULLY I CLASPED HIS HAND HE PRESSED MINE
lbi-116-288045-0003 WE GAZED FOR A MOMENT SILENTLY INTO EACH OTHER'S EYES
lbi-116-288045-0004 OF COURSE YOU ARE GOING THERE TOO I SAID TO MY FRIENDLY GUIDE
lbi-116-288045-0005 YES HE ANSWERED I CONDUCT THE WORSHIP I AM A PRIEST
lbi-116-288045-0006 AN IDOL I WHISPERED TAKEN BY SURPRISE
lbi-116-288045-0007 THEY WORSHIPPED GODS THAT DID NOT EXIST
lbi-116-288045-0008 BUT THE GREEKS LOVED THEIR GODS I PROTESTED MY HEART CLAMORING IN MY BREAST
lbi-116-288045-0009 NO I SAID IN A LOW VOICE
lbi-116-288045-0010 HE WAS AN IDOL THEN AND NOT A GOD
lbi-116-288045-0011 IT MADE ATHENS A CITY OF LIGHT IT CREATED THE BEAUTIFUL THE TRUE THE GOOD YES OUR RELIGION WAS DIVINE
lbi-116-288045-0012 IT HAD ONLY ONE FAULT INTERRUPTED MY GUIDE WHAT WAS THAT
lbi-116-288045-0013 I INQUIRED WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT HIS ANSWER WOULD BE IT WAS NOT TRUE
lbi-116-288045-0014 PRODUCE HIM
lbi-116-288045-0015 I WHISPERED TO MYSELF WHAT BLASPHEMY
lbi-116-288045-0016 THEN TAKING HEART I TOLD MY GUIDE HOW MORE THAN ONCE I HAD FELT APOLLO'S RADIANT PRESENCE IN MY HEART AND TOLD HIM OF THE IMMORTAL LINES OF HOMER CONCERNING THE DIVINE APOLLO
lbi-116-288045-0017 DO YOU DOUBT HOMER
lbi-116-288045-0018 I SAID TO HIM HOMER THE INSPIRED BARD
lbi-116-288045-0019 NO NO APOLLO IS NOT AN IDOL
lbi-116-288045-0020 HE IS A GOD AND THE SON OF A GOD
lbi-116-288045-0021 THE AIR WAS HEAVY WITH INCENSE A NUMBER OF MEN IN GORGEOUS VESTMENTS WERE PASSING TO AND FRO BOWING AND KNEELING BEFORE THE VARIOUS LIGHTS AND IMAGES
lbi-116-288045-0022 OBSERVING MY ANXIETY TO UNDERSTAND THE MEANING OF ALL THIS MY GUIDE TOOK ME ASIDE AND IN A WHISPER TOLD ME THAT THE PEOPLE WERE CELEBRATING THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE BIRTHDAY OF THEIR BEAUTIFUL SAVIOR JESUS THE SON OF GOD
lbi-116-288045-0023 FORGET APOLLO HE SAID WITH A SUGGESTION OF SEVERITY IN HIS VOICE
lbi-116-288045-0024 THERE IS NO SUCH PERSON HE WAS ONLY AN IDOL
lbi-116-288045-0025 IF YOU WERE TO SEARCH FOR APOLLO IN ALL THE UNIVERSE YOU WOULD NEVER FIND ANY ONE ANSWERING TO HIS NAME OR DESCRIPTION
lbi-116-288045-0026 I WANT TO SEE JESUS I HASTENED TURNING TOWARD HIM
lbi-116-288045-0027 WILL HE NOT BE HERE THIS MORNING
lbi-116-288045-0028 WILL HE NOT SPEAK TO HIS WORSHIPPERS I ASKED AGAIN
lbi-116-288045-0029 WILL HE NOT PERMIT THEM TO TOUCH HIM TO CARESS HIS HAND TO CLASP HIS DIVINE FEET TO INHALE THE AMBROSIAL FRAGRANCE OF HIS BREATH TO BASK IN THE GOLDEN LIGHT OF HIS EYES TO HEAR THE MUSIC OF HIS IMMACULATE ACCENTS
lbi-116-288045-0030 I ASKED MY EYES FILLED WITH WONDER AND MY VOICE QUIVERING WITH EXCITEMENT
lbi-116-288045-0031 WOULD NOT THAT THEN I VENTURED TO ASK IMPATIENTLY MAKE JESUS AS MUCH OF AN IDOL AS APOLLO
lbi-116-288045-0032 AND IF FAITH THAT JESUS IS A GOD PROVES HIM A GOD WHY WILL NOT FAITH IN APOLLO MAKE HIM A GOD
lbi-116-288046-0000 BUT I AM DETERMINED NOT ONLY TO KNOW IF IT IS POSSIBLE THE WHOLE TRUTH ABOUT JESUS BUT ALSO TO COMMUNICATE THAT TRUTH TO OTHERS
lbi-116-288046-0001 BUT THERE IS MORE OF A MORAL TONIC IN THE OPEN AND CANDID DISCUSSION OF A SUBJECT LIKE THE ONE IN HAND THAN IN A MULTITUDE OF PLATITUDES
lbi-116-288046-0002 I NEVER DELIVER A LECTURE IN WHICH I DO NOT EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY GIVE FULL AND FREE EXPRESSION TO MY FAITH IN EVERYTHING THAT IS WORTHY OF FAITH
lbi-116-288046-0003 IF I DO NOT BELIEVE IN DOGMA IT IS BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN FREEDOM
lbi-116-288046-0004 OH HE TEARS DOWN BUT DOES NOT BUILD UP IS ANOTHER CRITICISM ABOUT MY WORK IT IS NOT TRUE
lbi-116-288046-0005 NO PREACHER OR PRIEST IS MORE CONSTRUCTIVE
lbi-116-288046-0006 CLAPPING TRUTH INTO JAIL GAGGING THE MOUTH OF THE STUDENT IS THAT BUILDING UP OR TEARING DOWN
lbi-116-288046-0007 WHEN BRUNO LIGHTED A NEW TORCH TO INCREASE THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD WHAT WAS HIS REWARD THE STAKE
lbi-116-288046-0008 COUNT YOUR RIGHTS POLITICAL RELIGIOUS SOCIAL INTELLECTUAL AND TELL ME WHICH OF THEM WAS CONQUERED FOR YOU BY THE PRIEST
lbi-116-288046-0009 I WISH TO TELL YOU SOMETHING
lbi-116-288046-0010 BUT FIRST LET US BE IMPERSONAL THE EPITHETS IRREVERENT BLASPHEMER ATHEIST AND INFIDEL ARE FLUNG AT A MAN NOT FROM PITY BUT FROM ENVY
lbi-116-288046-0011 NOT HAVING THE COURAGE OR THE INDUSTRY OF OUR NEIGHBOR WHO WORKS LIKE A BUSY BEE IN THE WORLD OF MEN AND BOOKS SEARCHING WITH THE SWEAT OF HIS BROW FOR THE REAL BREAD OF LIFE WETTING THE OPEN PAGE BEFORE HIM WITH HIS TEARS PUSHING INTO THE WEE HOURS OF THE NIGHT HIS QUEST ANIMATED BY THE FAIREST OF ALL LOVES THE LOVE OF TRUTH WE EASE OUR OWN INDOLENT CONSCIENCE BY CALLING HIM NAMES
lbi-116-288047-0000 A MYTH IS A FANCIFUL EXPLANATION OF A GIVEN PHENOMENON
lbi-116-288047-0001 THE MIND CRAVES FOR KNOWLEDGE THE CHILD ASKS QUESTIONS BECAUSE OF AN INBORN DESIRE TO KNOW
lbi-116-288047-0002 NOW AND THEN THEY CAME CLOSE ENOUGH TO SNAP AT EACH OTHER
lbi-116-288047-0003 WITH THIS MYTHUS THE PRIMITIVE MAN WAS SATISFIED UNTIL HIS DEVELOPING INTELLIGENCE REALIZED ITS INADEQUACY SCIENCE WAS BORN OF THAT REALIZATION
lbi-116-288047-0004 THE MYTH OF A ONE EYED PEOPLE LIVING IN INDIA HAS BEEN REPLACED BY ACCURATE INFORMATION CONCERNING THE HINDOOS
lbi-116-288047-0005 AND THIS IS PRECISELY THE USE TO WHICH MYTHS HAVE BEEN PUT
lbi-116-288047-0006 IS JESUS A MYTH
lbi-116-288047-0007 THERE IS IN MAN A FACULTY FOR FICTION
lbi-116-288047-0008 IT THINKS LESS THAN IT GUESSES
lbi-116-288047-0009 IT IS REFLECTION WHICH INTRODUCES A BIT INTO THE MOUTH OF IMAGINATION CURBING ITS PACE AND SUBDUING ITS RESTLESS SPIRIT
lbi-116-288047-0010 WE FILL THE SPACE ABOUT AND OVER US WITH SPIRITS FAIRIES GODS AND OTHER INVISIBLE AND AIRY BEINGS
lbi-116-288047-0011 WE COVET THE RAINBOW WE REACH OUT FOR THE MOON
lbi-116-288047-0012 OUR FEET DO NOT REALLY BEGIN TO TOUCH THE FIRM GROUND UNTIL WE HAVE REACHED THE YEARS OF DISCRETION
lbi-116-288047-0013 SCIENCE WAS NOT BORN UNTIL MAN HAD MATURED
lbi-116-288047-0014 GROWN UP PEOPLE CREATE SCIENCE
lbi-116-288047-0015 THE CRADLE IS THE WOMB OF ALL THE FAIRIES AND FAITHS OF MANKIND
lbi-116-288047-0016 THE SCHOOL IS THE BIRTHPLACE OF SCIENCE
lbi-116-288047-0017 RELIGION IS THE SCIENCE OF THE CHILD
lbi-116-288047-0018 IN THE DISCUSSION OF THIS SUBJECT I APPEAL TO THE MATURE NOT TO THE CHILD MIND
lbi-116-288047-0019 HE IS GOD'S MOUTHPIECE AND NO ONE MAY DISAGREE WITH HIM
lbi-116-288047-0020 THE ONLY WAY I MAY COMMAND YOUR RESPECT IS TO BE REASONABLE
lbi-116-288047-0021 LET US PLACE OURSELVES ENTIRELY IN THE HANDS OF THE EVIDENCE
lbi-116-288047-0022 AS INTELLIGENT BEINGS WE DESIRE TO KNOW WHETHER THIS JESUS WHOSE WORSHIP IS NOT ONLY COSTING THE WORLD MILLIONS OF THE PEOPLE'S MONEY BUT WHICH IS ALSO DRAWING TO HIS SERVICE THE TIME THE ENERGIES THE AFFECTION THE DEVOTION AND THE LABOR OF HUMANITY IS A MYTH OR A REALITY
lbi-116-288048-0000 A NUMBER OF OTHER DATES WERE OBSERVED BY THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH AT VARIOUS TIMES AS THE BIRTHDAY OF JESUS THE GOSPELS GIVE NO DATE AND APPEAR TO BE QUITE UNCERTAIN REALLY IGNORANT ABOUT IT
lbi-116-288048-0001 YET THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT HE WAS BORN ON THAT DAY
lbi-116-288048-0002 WHY THIS DISCREPANCY IN A HISTORICAL DOCUMENT TO SAY NOTHING ABOUT INSPIRATION
lbi-116-288048-0003 AGAIN MATTHEW SAYS THAT TO ESCAPE THE EVIL DESIGNS OF HEROD MARY AND JOSEPH WITH THE INFANT JESUS FLED INTO EGYPT LUKE SAYS NOTHING ABOUT THIS HURRIED FLIGHT NOR OF HEROD'S INTENTION TO KILL THE INFANT MESSIAH
lbi-116-288048-0004 WHEN WE COME TO THE MORE IMPORTANT CHAPTERS ABOUT JESUS WE MEET WITH GREATER DIFFICULTIES
lbi-116-288048-0005 WHILE IT IS ALWAYS ON A FRIDAY THAT THE CRUCIFIXION IS COMMEMORATED THE WEEK IN WHICH THE DAY OCCURS VARIES FROM YEAR TO YEAR
lbi-116-288048-0006 GOOD FRIDAY FALLS NOT BEFORE THE SPRING EQUINOX BUT AS SOON AFTER THE SPRING EQUINOX AS THE FULL MOON ALLOWS THUS MAKING THE CALCULATION TO DEPEND UPON THE POSITION OF THE SUN IN THE ZODIAC AND THE PHASES OF THE MOON
lbi-116-288048-0007 THE PAGAN OESTERA HAS BECOME THE CHRISTIAN EASTER
lbi-116-288048-0008 BUT IN THE ABSENCE OF EVIDENCE ORIGIN OFFERS THE FOLLOWING METAPHYSICAL ARGUMENTS AGAINST THE SCEPTICAL CELSUS ONE
lbi-116-288048-0009 IF WE ARE TO HAVE ANY MYTHOLOGY AT ALL HE SEEMS TO ARGUE WHY OBJECT TO ADDING TO IT THE MYTHUS OF JESUS
lbi-116-288048-0010 THE IMMEDIATE COMPANIONS OF JESUS APPEAR TO BE ON THE OTHER HAND AS MYTHICAL AS HE IS HIMSELF
lbi-116-288048-0011 WHO WAS MATTHEW WHO WAS MARK
lbi-116-288048-0012 WHO WERE JOHN PETER JUDAS AND MARY
lbi-116-288048-0013 THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE THAT THEY EVER EXISTED
lbi-116-288048-0014 IF PETER EVER WENT TO ROME WITH A NEW DOCTRINE HOW IS IT THAT NO HISTORIAN HAS TAKEN NOTE OF HIM
lbi-116-288048-0015 HERE AGAIN WE SEE THE PRESENCE OF A MYTH
lbi-116-288048-0016 HE WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO SAW THEM
lbi-116-288048-0017 PETER PAUL JOHN JAMES JUDAS OCCUPY THE STAGE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY
lbi-116-288048-0018 IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO EXPLAIN WHY THE CONTEMPORARIES OF JESUS THE AUTHORS AND HISTORIANS OF HIS TIME DO NOT TAKE NOTICE OF HIM
lbi-116-288048-0019 COULD THEY HAVE BEEN IN A CONSPIRACY AGAINST HIM
lbi-116-288048-0020 HOW ELSE IS THIS UNANIMOUS SILENCE TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR
lbi-116-288048-0021 HOW THEN ARE WE TO DECIDE WHICH OF THE NUMEROUS CANDIDATES FOR DIVINE HONORS SHOULD BE GIVEN OUR VOTES
lbi-116-288048-0022 AND SUCH A FAITH IS NEVER FREE IT IS ALWAYS MAINTAINED BY THE SWORD NOW AND BY HELL FIRE HEREAFTER
lbi-116-288048-0023 YET THE MOST IMPOSSIBLE UTTERANCES ARE PUT IN JESUS MOUTH
lbi-116-288048-0024 ONLY A MYTHICAL JESUS COULD VIRTUALLY HAND OVER THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNIVERSE TO COURTIERS WHO HAVE PETITIONS TO PRESS UPON HIS ATTENTION
lbi-116-288048-0025 MOREOVER IF JESUS COULD KEEP HIS PROMISE THERE WOULD BE TODAY NO MISERY IN THE WORLD NO ORPHANS NO CHILDLESS MOTHERS NO SHIPWRECKS NO FLOODS NO FAMINES NO DISEASE NO CRIPPLED CHILDREN NO INSANITY NO WARS NO CRIME NO WRONG
lbi-116-288048-0026 HAVE THESE PRAYERS BEEN ANSWERED
lbi-116-288048-0027 HOW MANY SELF DELUDED PROPHETS THESE EXTRAVAGANT CLAIMS HAVE PRODUCED
lbi-116-288048-0028 AND WHO CAN NUMBER THE BITTER DISAPPOINTMENTS CAUSED BY SUCH IMPOSSIBLE PROMISES
lbi-116-288048-0029 THE SAME WHICH THE PREACHERS OF TODAY GIVE HE PARRIED HIS ANSWER WITH MANY WORDS AND AT LENGTH SAID THAT THE PROMISE WAS TO BE TAKEN WITH THE PROVISION THAT WHAT WE ASKED FOR WOULD BE GIVEN IF GOD THOUGHT IT FOR OUR GOOD
lbi-116-288048-0030 BUT HE SAID IF YE ASK ANYTHING IN MY NAME I WILL DO IT AND IF IT WERE NOT SO I WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU
lbi-116-288048-0031 DID HE NOT MEAN JUST WHAT HE SAID
lbi-116-288048-0032 SELF EFFORT AND NOT PRAYER IS THE REMEDY AGAINST IGNORANCE SLAVERY POVERTY AND MORAL DEGRADATION
lbi-1255-138279-0000 IT WAS A NIGHT WHEN SORROW MAY COME TO THE BRIGHTEST WITHOUT CAUSING ANY GREAT SENSE OF INCONGRUITY WHEN WITH IMPRESSIBLE PERSONS LOVE BECOMES SOLICITOUSNESS HOPE SINKS TO MISGIVING AND FAITH TO HOPE WHEN THE EXERCISE OF MEMORY DOES NOT STIR FEELINGS OF REGRET AT OPPORTUNITIES FOR AMBITION THAT HAVE BEEN PASSED BY AND ANTICIPATION DOES NOT PROMPT TO ENTERPRISE
lbi-1255-138279-0001 STILL TO A CLOSE OBSERVER THEY ARE JUST AS PERCEPTIBLE THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT THEIR MEDIA OF MANIFESTATION ARE LESS TRITE AND FAMILIAR THAN SUCH WELL KNOWN ONES AS THE BURSTING OF THE BUDS OR THE FALL OF THE LEAF
lbi-1255-138279-0002 IF ANYTHING COULD BE DARKER THAN THE SKY IT WAS THE WALL AND IF ANY THING COULD BE GLOOMIER THAN THE WALL IT WAS THE RIVER BENEATH
lbi-1255-138279-0003 AN INDESCRIBABLE SUCCESSION OF DULL BLOWS PERPLEXING IN THEIR REGULARITY SENT THEIR SOUND WITH DIFFICULTY THROUGH THE FLUFFY ATMOSPHERE
lbi-1255-138279-0004 NOT LONG AFTER A FORM MOVED BY THE BRINK OF THE RIVER
lbi-1255-138279-0005 THIS WAS ALL THAT WAS POSITIVELY DISCOVERABLE THOUGH IT SEEMED HUMAN
lbi-1255-138279-0006 THE SHAPE WENT SLOWLY ALONG BUT WITHOUT MUCH EXERTION FOR THE SNOW THOUGH SUDDEN WAS NOT AS YET MORE THAN TWO INCHES DEEP
lbi-1255-138279-0007 AT THIS TIME SOME WORDS WERE SPOKEN ALOUD ONE
lbi-1255-138279-0008 TWO THREE
lbi-1255-138279-0009 FOUR FIVE
lbi-1255-138279-0010 BETWEEN EACH UTTERANCE THE LITTLE SHAPE ADVANCED ABOUT HALF A DOZEN YARDS
lbi-1255-138279-0011 HERE THE SPOT STOPPED AND DWINDLED SMALLER
lbi-1255-138279-0012 THEN A MORSEL OF SNOW FLEW ACROSS THE RIVER TOWARDS THE FIFTH WINDOW
lbi-1255-138279-0013 THE RIVER WOULD HAVE BEEN SEEN BY DAY TO BE OF THAT DEEP SMOOTH SORT WHICH RACES MIDDLE AND SIDES WITH THE SAME GLIDING PRECISION ANY IRREGULARITIES OF SPEED BEING IMMEDIATELY CORRECTED BY A SMALL WHIRLPOOL
lbi-1255-138279-0014 THE WINDOW WAS STRUCK AGAIN IN THE SAME MANNER
lbi-1255-138279-0015 THEN A NOISE WAS HEARD APPARENTLY PRODUCED BY THE OPENING OF THE WINDOW
lbi-1255-138279-0016 SAID THE BLURRED SPOT IN THE SNOW TREMULOUSLY
lbi-1255-138279-0017 I ASKED WHICH WAS YOUR WINDOW FORGIVE ME
lbi-1255-138279-0018 WELL I SAID THAT YOU MIGHT
lbi-1255-138279-0019 O MUST I IT IS WHEN SHALL WE BE MARRIED FRANK
lbi-1255-138279-0020 I HAVE MONEY
lbi-1255-138279-0021 AND WE LIVE IN TWO PARISHES DO WE WHAT THEN
lbi-1255-138279-0022 IF I SAID SO OF COURSE I WILL
lbi-1255-138279-0023 THE FACT IS I FORGOT TO ASK
lbi-1255-138279-0024 GOOD NIGHT FRANK GOOD NIGHT
lbi-1255-74899-0000 THINGS ARRANGE THEMSELVES
lbi-1255-74899-0001 BUT THE COUNTESS NEVER GAVE WAY AN INCH
lbi-1255-74899-0002 THE FOLLOWING WAS THE ANSWER WHICH SHE RETURNED TO THE NOTE WRITTEN TO HER BY AUNT JULIA
lbi-1255-74899-0003 I SHOULD NOT KNOW HOW TO DRINK WINE WITH THEM AND SHOULD DO A HUNDRED THINGS WHICH WOULD MAKE THEM THINK ME A BEAST
lbi-1255-74899-0004 BUT THE GIRL BEGGED FOR SOME DELAY
lbi-1255-74899-0005 IT WAS A MATTER THAT REQUIRED TO BE CONSIDERED
lbi-1255-74899-0006 PRIDE IN HIM MIGHT BE AS WEAK AS PRIDE IN THEM
lbi-1255-74899-0007 IF THEY WOULD PUT OUT THEIR HANDS TO HIM WHY SHOULD HE REFUSE TO PUT OUT HIS OWN
lbi-1255-74899-0008 OUR TAILOR RECEIVED HIM COURTEOUSLY HAVING LEARNED TO LIKE THE MAN UNDERSTANDING THAT HE HAD BEHAVED WITH HONESTY AND WISDOM IN REGARD TO HIS CLIENT AND RESPECTING HIM AS ONE OF THE WORKERS OF THE DAY BUT HE DECLARED THAT FOR THE LOVEL FAMILY AS A FAMILY HE DID NOT CARE FOR THEM PARTICULARLY
lbi-1255-74899-0009 THEY ARE POLES ASUNDER FROM ME HE SAID
lbi-1255-74899-0010 BUT BY YOUR GOOD FORTUNE AND MERIT IF YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO SAY SO YOU HAVE TRAVELLED FROM THE ONE POLE VERY FAR TOWARDS THE OTHER
lbi-1255-74899-0011 AT PRESENT I THINK THAT THE SENSE OF THE COUNTRY IS IN FAVOUR OF AN ARISTOCRACY OF BIRTH
lbi-1255-74899-0012 WHEN YOU WERE FOREMOST AMONG THEM DID YOU NOT WISH TO BE THEIR MASTER
lbi-1255-74899-0013 IT IS ONE TO WHICH ALL LEGISLATIVE AND ALL HUMAN EFFORTS SHOULD AND MUST TEND
lbi-1255-74899-0014 WHEN YOU MAKE MUCH WATER BOIL MISTER THWAITE SOME OF IT WILL PROBABLY BOIL OVER
lbi-1255-74899-0015 I QUITE AGREE WITH YOU THAT THE SILK GOWNS SHOULD BE KEPT FOR THEIR ELDERS AND SO THE CONVERSATION WAS ENDED
lbi-1255-74899-0016 WITH HER THERE WAS A REAL WISH THAT THE POLES MIGHT BE JOINED TOGETHER BY HER FUTURE HUSBAND
lbi-1255-74899-0017 IF YOU REALLY WISH IT YOU SHALL GO HE SAID
lbi-1255-74899-0018 AND A BLUE ONE TO BE MARRIED IN ALAS ME
lbi-1255-74899-0019 MUST I HAVE A PINK SILK GOWN TO WALK ABOUT IN EARLY IN THE MORNING
lbi-1255-74899-0020 I'D SOONER SEE YOU DARNING MY WORSTED STOCKINGS SWEETHEART
lbi-1255-74899-0021 I CAN DO THAT TOO
lbi-1255-74899-0022 AND NOW I'LL SIT DOWN AND WRITE A LETTER TO MY LORD
lbi-1255-90407-0000 HE HOPED NOTHING SERIOUS HAD HAPPENED TO DRAG HER OUT AT SUCH AN UNTOWARD TIME
lbi-1255-90407-0001 BUT AS THE RAIN GAVE NOT THE LEAST SIGN OF CESSATION HE OBSERVED I THINK WE SHALL HAVE TO GO BACK NEVER
lbi-1255-90407-0002 WHY NOT HE INQUIRED
lbi-1255-90407-0003 I CANNOT UNDERSTAND HOW YOU SHOULD KNOW ME WHILE I HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF YOU
lbi-1255-90407-0004 OH BUT YOU KNOW ME ABOUT ME AT LEAST
lbi-1255-90407-0005 I SHOULD THINK SO
lbi-1255-90407-0006 HE'S MY FATHER INDEED
lbi-1255-90407-0007 BUT WE HAVE BEEN TENANTS OF SYLVANIA CASTLE ON THE ISLAND HERE THIS SEASON
lbi-1255-90407-0008 MY FATHER'S IS A COMPARATIVELY HUMBLE RESIDENCE HARD BY
lbi-1255-90407-0009 BUT HE COULD AFFORD A MUCH BIGGER ONE IF HE CHOSE
lbi-1255-90407-0010 YOU HAVE HEARD SO
lbi-1255-90407-0011 I DON'T KNOW HE DOESN'T TELL ME MUCH OF HIS AFFAIRS
lbi-1255-90407-0012 MY FATHER SHE BURST OUT SUDDENLY IS ALWAYS SCOLDING ME FOR MY EXTRAVAGANCE
lbi-1255-90407-0013 WAS THAT THIS EVENING
lbi-1255-90407-0014 AND THERE ON THE NETS THEY SAT
lbi-1255-90407-0015 JOCELYN THOUGHT IT STRANGE THAT HE SHOULD BE THROWN BY FATE INTO A POSITION TO PLAY THE SON OF THE MONTAGUES TO THIS DAUGHTER OF THE CAPULETS
lbi-1255-90407-0016 NO I SHALL GO ON AND GET A LODGING IN BUDMOUTH TOWN IF EVER I REACH IT
lbi-1255-90407-0017 IT IS SO LATE THAT THERE WILL BE NO HOUSE OPEN EXCEPT A LITTLE PLACE NEAR THE STATION WHERE YOU WON'T CARE TO STAY
lbi-1255-90407-0018 THE ISLAND WAS AN ISLAND STILL
lbi-1255-90407-0019 THEY HAD NOT REALIZED THE FORCE OF THE ELEMENTS TILL NOW
lbi-1255-90407-0020 HE STEADIED HER BODILY BY ENCIRCLING HER WAIST WITH HIS ARM AND SHE MADE NO OBJECTION
lbi-1255-90407-0021 HE PITIED HER AND WHILE HE WONDERED AT IT ADMIRED HER DETERMINATION
lbi-1255-90407-0022 THEIR APPLICATION FOR ADMISSION LED TO THE WITHDRAWAL OF A BOLT AND THEY STOOD WITHIN THE GASLIGHT OF THE PASSAGE
lbi-1255-90407-0023 HE COULD SEE NOW THAT THOUGH SHE WAS SUCH A FINE FIGURE QUITE AS TALL AS HIMSELF SHE WAS BUT IN THE BLOOM OF YOUNG WOMANHOOD
lbi-1255-90407-0024 I WILL TELL THE SERVANT TO DO THIS AND SEND YOU UP SOMETHING TO EAT
lbi-1255-90407-0025 HE FELT RAVENOUSLY HUNGRY HIMSELF AND SET ABOUT DRYING HIS CLOTHES AS WELL AS HE COULD AND EATING AT THE SAME TIME
lbi-1255-90407-0026 BY THE AID OF SOME TEMPORARY WRAPS AND SOME SLIPPERS FROM THE CUPBOARD HE WAS CONTRIVING TO MAKE HIMSELF COMFORTABLE WHEN THE MAID SERVANT CAME DOWNSTAIRS WITH A DAMP ARMFUL OF WOMAN'S RAIMENT
lbi-1255-90407-0027 YOU ARE SLEEPY MY GIRL SAID PIERSTON
lbi-1255-90407-0028 HE AGAIN BECAME CONSCIOUS OF THE CHANGE WHICH HAD BEEN INITIATED DURING THE WALK
lbi-1255-90407-0029 THE WELL BELOVED WAS MOVING HOUSE HAD GONE OVER TO THE WEARER OF THIS ATTIRE
lbi-1255-90407-0030 AND HOW ABOUT LITTLE AVICE CARO
lbi-1255-90413-0000 SHE DRAWS CLOSE AND SATISFIES
lbi-1255-90413-0001 HE COULD NOT FORGET MISSUS PINE AVON'S EYES THOUGH HE REMEMBERED NOTHING OF HER OTHER FACIAL DETAILS
lbi-1255-90413-0002 AFTERWARDS THEY KEPT APART AWHILE IN THE DRAWING ROOM FOR FORM'S SAKE BUT EVENTUALLY GRAVITATED TOGETHER AGAIN AND FINISHED THE EVENING IN EACH OTHER'S COMPANY
lbi-1255-90413-0003 BUT THIS WAS NOT ALL
lbi-1255-90413-0004 BUT WAS HE ABLE
lbi-1255-90413-0005 IT WAS UNFAIR TO GO FURTHER WITHOUT TELLING HER EVEN THOUGH HITHERTO SUCH EXPLICITNESS HAD NOT BEEN ABSOLUTELY DEMANDED
lbi-1255-90413-0006 HE DETERMINED TO CALL IMMEDIATELY ON THE NEW INCARNATION
lbi-1255-90413-0007 SHE LIVED NOT FAR FROM THE LONG FASHIONABLE HAMPTONSHIRE SQUARE AND HE WENT THITHER WITH EXPECTATIONS OF HAVING A HIGHLY EMOTIONAL TIME AT LEAST
lbi-1255-90413-0008 BUT SOMEHOW THE VERY BELL PULL SEEMED COLD ALTHOUGH SHE HAD SO EARNESTLY ASKED HIM TO COME
lbi-1255-90413-0009 RAISING HER EYES IN A SLIGHTLY INQUIRING MANNER FROM THE BOOK SHE WAS READING SHE LEANT BACK IN THE CHAIR AS IF SOAKING HERSELF IN LUXURIOUS SENSATIONS WHICH HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM AND REPLIED TO HIS GREETING WITH A FEW COMMONPLACE WORDS
lbi-1255-90413-0010 JUST AS THEY TURN MADEIRA INTO PORT IN THE SPACE OF A SINGLE NIGHT SO THIS OLD AIR HAS BEEN TAKEN AND DOCTORED AND TWISTED ABOUT AND BROUGHT OUT AS A NEW POPULAR DITTY INDEED
lbi-1255-90413-0011 SHE THAWED A LITTLE AND THEN THEY WENT ON TO TALK ABOUT HER HOUSE WHICH HAD BEEN NEWLY PAINTED AND DECORATED WITH GREENISH BLUE SATIN UP TO THE HEIGHT OF A PERSON'S HEAD AN ARRANGEMENT THAT SOMEWHAT IMPROVED HER SLIGHTLY FADED THOUGH STILL PRETTY FACE AND WAS HELPED BY THE AWNINGS OVER THE WINDOWS
lbi-1255-90413-0012 YES I HAVE HAD MY HOUSE SOME YEARS SHE OBSERVED COMPLACENTLY AND I LIKE IT BETTER EVERY YEAR
lbi-1255-90413-0013 DON'T YOU FEEL LONELY IN IT SOMETIMES O NEVER
lbi-1255-90413-0014 WHAT AN UNCIVIL THING TO SAY SHE MURMURED IN SURPRISE
lbi-1255-90413-0015 IT IS RATHER UNCIVIL
lbi-1255-90413-0016 AS A PUNISHMENT SHE DID NOT RING THE BELL BUT LEFT HIM TO FIND HIS WAY OUT AS HE COULD
lbi-1255-90413-0017 I SAW HIM AT LADY CHANNELCLIFFE'S THE OTHER NIGHT
lbi-1255-90413-0018 JOCELYN PIERSTON
lbi-1255-90413-0019 O DIDN'T HE MARRY HER
lbi-1255-90413-0020 SAID MISSUS PINE AVON WITH A START
lbi-1255-90413-0021 BUT JOCELYN WAS RECEDING FROM THE PRETTY WIDOW'S HOUSE WITH LONG STRIDES
lbi-1255-90413-0022 LADY IRIS HAD LEFT THE DRAWING ROOM FOR A MOMENT TO SEE THAT ALL WAS RIGHT IN THE DINING ROOM AND WHEN HE WAS SHOWN IN THERE STOOD ALONE IN THE LAMPLIGHT NICHOLA PINE AVON
lbi-1255-90413-0023 SHE HAD BEEN THE FIRST ARRIVAL
lbi-1255-90413-0024 AS THE OTHER GUESTS DROPPED IN THE PAIR RETREATED INTO A SHADY CORNER AND SHE TALKED BESIDE HIM TILL ALL MOVED OFF FOR THE EATING AND DRINKING
lbi-1255-90413-0025 HE HAD NOT BEEN APPOINTED TO TAKE HER ACROSS TO THE DINING ROOM BUT AT THE TABLE FOUND HER EXACTLY OPPOSITE
lbi-1255-90413-0026 THE SPRING IN THE PRESENT CASE WAS THE ARTISTIC COMMENDATION SHE DESERVED AND CRAVED
lbi-1255-90413-0027 THE LADY ON JOCELYN'S LEFT WIFE OF A LORD JUSTICE OF APPEAL WAS IN LIKE MANNER TALKING TO HER COMPANION ON THE OUTER SIDE SO THAT FOR THE TIME HE WAS LEFT TO HIMSELF
lbi-1255-90413-0028 IT CAME FROM THE WIFE OF ONE OF HIS FATHER'S FORMER WORKMEN AND WAS CONCERNING HER SON WHOM SHE BEGGED JOCELYN TO RECOMMEND AS CANDIDATE FOR SOME POST IN TOWN THAT SHE WISHED HIM TO FILL
lbi-1585-131718-0000 WHAT IS NECESSARY TO THE COMPLETENESS OF THE STORY AT THIS STAGE IS NOT TO RECAPITULATE BUT TO TAKE UP SOME OF THE LOOSE ENDS OF THREADS WOVEN IN AND FOLLOW THEM THROUGH UNTIL THE CLEAR AND COMPREHENSIVE PICTURE OF EVENTS CAN BE SEEN
lbi-1585-131718-0001 THE WAY OF THE INVENTOR IS HARD
lbi-1585-131718-0002 HE CAN SOMETIMES RAISE CAPITAL TO HELP HIM IN WORKING OUT HIS CRUDE CONCEPTIONS BUT EVEN THEN IT IS FREQUENTLY DONE AT A DISTRESSFUL COST OF PERSONAL SURRENDER
lbi-1585-131718-0003 WHEN THE RESULT IS ACHIEVED THE INVENTION MAKES ITS APPEAL ON THE SCORE OF ECONOMY OF MATERIAL OR OF EFFORT AND THEN LABOR OFTEN AWAITS WITH CRUSHING AND TYRANNICAL SPIRIT TO SMASH THE APPARATUS OR FORBID ITS VERY USE
lbi-1585-131718-0004 POSSIBLY OUR NATIONAL OPTIMISM AS REVEALED IN INVENTION THE SEEKING A HIGHER GOOD NEEDS SOME CHECK
lbi-1585-131718-0005 POSSIBLY THE LEADERS WOULD TRAVEL TOO FAST AND TOO FAR ON THE ROAD TO PERFECTION IF CONSERVATISM DID NOT ALSO PLAY ITS SALUTARY PART IN INSISTING THAT THE PROCESSION MOVE FORWARD AS A WHOLE
lbi-1585-131718-0006 ON THE CONTRARY THE CONDITIONS FOR ITS ACCEPTANCE HAD BEEN RIPENING FAST
lbi-1585-131718-0007 YET THE VERY VOGUE OF THE ELECTRIC ARC LIGHT MADE HARDER THE ARRIVAL OF THE INCANDESCENT
lbi-1585-131718-0008 A NUMBER OF PARENT ARC LIGHTING COMPANIES WERE IN EXISTENCE AND A GREAT MANY LOCAL COMPANIES HAD BEEN CALLED INTO BEING UNDER FRANCHISES FOR COMMERCIAL BUSINESS AND TO EXECUTE REGULAR CITY CONTRACTS FOR STREET LIGHTING
lbi-1585-131718-0009 THUS IN A CURIOUS MANNER THE MODERN ART OF ELECTRIC LIGHTING WAS IN A VERY TRUE SENSE DIVIDED AGAINST ITSELF WITH INTENSE RIVALRIES AND JEALOUSIES WHICH WERE NONE THE LESS REAL BECAUSE THEY WERE BUT TEMPORARY AND OCCURRED IN A FIELD WHERE ULTIMATE UNION OF FORCES WAS INEVITABLE
lbi-1585-131718-0010 HENCE TWENTY YEARS AFTER THE FIRST EDISON STATIONS WERE ESTABLISHED THE METHODS THEY INVOLVED COULD BE FAIRLY CREDITED WITH NO LESS THAN SIXTY SEVEN PER CENT
lbi-1585-131718-0011 IT WILL BE READILY UNDERSTOOD THAT UNDER THESE CONDITIONS THE MODERN LIGHTING COMPANY SUPPLIES TO ITS CUSTOMERS BOTH INCANDESCENT AND ARC LIGHTING FREQUENTLY FROM THE SAME DYNAMO ELECTRIC MACHINERY AS A SOURCE OF CURRENT AND THAT THE OLD FEUD AS BETWEEN THE RIVAL SYSTEMS HAS DIED OUT
lbi-1585-131718-0012 IN FACT FOR SOME YEARS PAST THE PRESIDENTS OF THE NATIONAL ELECTRIC LIGHT ASSOCIATION HAVE BEEN CHOSEN ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY FROM AMONG THE MANAGERS OF THE GREAT EDISON LIGHTING COMPANIES IN THE LEADING CITIES
lbi-1585-131718-0013 THE OTHER STRONG OPPOSITION TO THE INCANDESCENT LIGHT CAME FROM THE GAS INDUSTRY
lbi-1585-131718-0014 THERE ALSO THE MOST BITTER FEELING WAS SHOWN
lbi-1585-131718-0015 THE GAS MANAGER DID NOT LIKE THE ARC LIGHT BUT IT INTERFERED ONLY WITH HIS STREET SERVICE WHICH WAS NOT HIS LARGEST SOURCE OF INCOME BY ANY MEANS
lbi-1585-131718-0016 HERE AGAIN WAS GIVEN A MOST CONVINCING DEMONSTRATION OF THE TRUTH THAT SUCH AN ADDITION TO THE RESOURCES OF MANKIND ALWAYS CARRIES WITH IT UNSUSPECTED BENEFITS EVEN FOR ITS ENEMIES
lbi-1585-131718-0017 THIS WAS NOT LONG NOR UNIVERSALLY THE SPIRIT SHOWN AND TO DAY IN HUNDREDS OF CITIES THE ELECTRIC AND GAS PROPERTIES ARE UNITED UNDER THE ONE MANAGEMENT WHICH DOES NOT FIND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO PUSH IN A FRIENDLY AND PROGRESSIVE WAY THE USE OF BOTH ILLUMINANTS
lbi-1585-131718-0018 THE MOST CONSPICUOUS EXAMPLE OF THIS IDENTITY OF INTEREST IS GIVEN IN NEW YORK ITSELF
lbi-1585-131718-0019 SO MUCH FOR THE EARLY OPPOSITION OF WHICH THERE WAS PLENTY
lbi-1585-131718-0020 BUT IT MAY BE QUESTIONED WHETHER INERTIA IS NOT EQUALLY TO BE DREADED WITH ACTIVE ILL WILL
lbi-1585-131718-0021 OF COURSE A GREAT MANY ACCOUNTS WERE WRITTEN AND READ BUT WHILE GENUINE INTEREST WAS AROUSED IT WAS NECESSARILY APATHETIC
lbi-1585-131718-0022 WE GOT IT AT A GREAT BARGAIN AND ONLY PAID A SMALL SUM DOWN AND THE BALANCE ON MORTGAGE
lbi-1585-131718-0023 WE SOLD THEM FOR FORTY CENTS BUT THERE WERE ONLY ABOUT TWENTY OR THIRTY THOUSAND OF THEM
lbi-1585-131718-0024 THE FOURTH YEAR I GOT IT DOWN TO THIRTY SEVEN CENTS AND I MADE ALL THE MONEY UP IN ONE YEAR THAT I HAD LOST PREVIOUSLY
lbi-1585-131718-0025 ONE OF THE INCIDENTS WHICH CAUSED A VERY GREAT CHEAPENING WAS THAT WHEN WE STARTED ONE OF THE IMPORTANT PROCESSES HAD TO BE DONE BY EXPERTS
lbi-1585-131718-0026 AFTER FEELING AROUND FOR SOME DAYS I GOT A CLEW HOW TO DO IT
lbi-1585-131718-0027 I THEN MADE ANOTHER MACHINE WHICH DID THE WORK NICELY
lbi-1585-131718-0028 INCIDENTALLY IT MAY BE NOTED AS ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE PROBLEMS BROUGHT TO EDISON THAT WHILE HE HAD THE FACTORY AT HARRISON AN IMPORTER IN THE CHINESE TRADE WENT TO HIM AND WANTED A DYNAMO TO BE RUN BY HAND POWER
lbi-1585-131718-0029 FOR MAKING THE DYNAMOS EDISON SECURED AS NOTED IN THE PRECEDING CHAPTER THE ROACH IRON WORKS ON GOERCK STREET NEW YORK AND THIS WAS ALSO EQUIPPED
lbi-1585-131718-0030 TO SIGMUND BERGMANN WHO HAD WORKED PREVIOUSLY WITH EDISON ON TELEPHONE APPARATUS AND PHONOGRAPHS AND WAS ALREADY MAKING EDISON SPECIALTIES IN A SMALL WAY IN A LOFT ON WOOSTER STREET NEW YORK WAS ASSIGNED THE TASK OF CONSTRUCTING SOCKETS FIXTURES METERS SAFETY FUSES AND NUMEROUS OTHER DETAILS
lbi-1585-131718-0031 IN THE EARLY PART OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTY ONE THE EDISON ELECTRIC LIGHT COMPANY LEASED THE OLD BISHOP MANSION AT SIXTY FIVE FIFTH AVENUE CLOSE TO FOURTEENTH STREET FOR ITS HEADQUARTERS AND SHOW ROOMS
lbi-1585-131718-0032 THIS WAS ONE OF THE FINEST HOMES IN THE CITY OF THAT PERIOD AND ITS ACQUISITION WAS A PREMONITORY SIGN OF THE SURRENDER OF THE FAMOUS RESIDENTIAL AVENUE TO COMMERCE
lbi-1585-131718-0033 THE EXPERIENCE WITH THE LITTLE GAS ENGINE WAS RATHER STARTLING
lbi-1585-131718-0034 ONE DAY IT WAS NOT GOING VERY WELL AND I WENT DOWN TO THE MAN IN CHARGE AND GOT EXPLORING AROUND
lbi-1585-131718-0035 FOR THE NEXT FOUR OR FIVE YEARS SIXTY FIVE WAS A VERITABLE BEEHIVE DAY AND NIGHT
lbi-1585-131718-0036 THE ROUTINE WAS VERY MUCH THE SAME AS THAT AT THE LABORATORY IN ITS UTTER NEGLECT OF THE CLOCK
lbi-1585-131718-0037 I WAS TELLING A GENTLEMAN ONE DAY THAT I COULD NOT KEEP A CIGAR EVEN IF I LOCKED THEM UP IN MY DESK THEY WOULD BREAK IT OPEN
lbi-1585-131718-0038 HE SUGGESTED TO ME THAT HE HAD A FRIEND OVER ON EIGHTH AVENUE WHO MADE A SUPERIOR GRADE OF CIGARS AND WHO WOULD SHOW THEM A TRICK
lbi-1585-131718-0039 HE SAID HE WOULD HAVE SOME OF THEM MADE UP WITH HAIR AND OLD PAPER AND I COULD PUT THEM IN WITHOUT A WORD AND SEE THE RESULT
lbi-1585-131718-0040 I THOUGHT NO MORE ABOUT THE MATTER
lbi-1585-131718-0041 I DIDN'T REMEMBER ANYTHING ABOUT IT
lbi-1585-131718-0042 I WAS TOO BUSY ON OTHER THINGS TO NOTICE
lbi-1585-131718-0043 SPEAKING OF THOSE DAYS OR NIGHTS EDISON SAYS YEARS AGO ONE OF THE GREAT VIOLINISTS WAS REMENYI
lbi-1585-131718-0044 HE WOULD TALK WITH ME BUT I NEVER ASKED HIM TO BRING HIS VIOLIN
lbi-1585-131718-0045 ONE NIGHT HE CAME WITH HIS VIOLIN ABOUT TWELVE O'CLOCK
lbi-1585-131718-0046 AFTER THAT EVERY TIME HE CAME TO NEW YORK HE USED TO CALL AT SIXTY FIVE LATE AT NIGHT WITH HIS VIOLIN
lbi-1585-131718-0047 ANOTHER VISITOR WHO USED TO GIVE US A GOOD DEAL OF AMUSEMENT AND PLEASURE WAS CAPTAIN SHAW THE HEAD OF THE LONDON FIRE BRIGADE
lbi-1585-131718-0048 HE WOULD GO OUT AMONG THE FIRE LADDIES AND HAVE A GREAT TIME
lbi-1585-131718-0049 SPEAKING OF TELLING STORIES I ONCE GOT TELLING A MAN STORIES AT THE HARRISON LAMP FACTORY IN THE YARD AS HE WAS LEAVING
lbi-1585-131718-0050 IT WAS WINTER AND HE WAS ALL IN FURS
lbi-1585-131718-0051 I HAD NOTHING ON TO PROTECT ME AGAINST THE COLD
lbi-1585-131718-0052 THEN I GOT PLEURISY AND HAD TO BE SHIPPED TO FLORIDA FOR CURE
lbi-1585-131718-0053 IT HAD MERELY ENJOYED THE DELIGHTS OF ANXIOUS ANTICIPATION AND THE PERILOUS PLEASURE OF BACKING EDISON'S EXPERIMENTS
lbi-1585-131718-0054 NOW ACTIVE EXPLOITATION WAS REQUIRED
lbi-1585-157660-0000 LONDON ITS GUILT AND GLORY
lbi-1585-157660-0001 THEY SAY BEST MEN ARE MOLDED OUT OF FAULTS AND FOR THE MOST BECOME MUCH MORE THE BETTER FOR BEING A LITTLE BAD
lbi-1585-157660-0002 STANDING ON A BROKEN COLUMN OF THE OLD STEEPLE THREE HUNDRED FEET ABOVE PRIMROSE HILL WILLIAM STRUCK AN ATTITUDE OF THEATRICAL FASHION AND UTTERED THE FOLLOWING ORATORICAL FLIGHT
lbi-1585-157660-0003 GLORIOUS LONDON
lbi-1585-157660-0004 SAD HOW SAD TO THINK THAT THE DAY WILL COME WHEN NOT A VESTIGE OF THIS WONDERFUL MASS OF HUMAN ENERGY SHALL REMAIN WHERE THE CRY OF THE WOLF BAT AND BITTERN SHALL ONLY BE HEARD AND NATURE AGAIN RESUME HER RUSTIC SPLENDID DESOLATION
lbi-1585-157660-0005 THE DEVIL'S TAVERN WAS A RESORT FOR ACTORS AUTHORS BOHEMIANS LORDS AND LADIES WHO DID NOT RETIRE EARLY TO THEIR DOWNY COUCHES
lbi-1585-157660-0006 WILLIAM AND MYSELF SOON FOUND REST IN DEEP SLUMBER AND WAFTED AWAY INTO A DREAMLESS REALM OUR TIRED BODIES LAY IN THE ENFOLDING ARMS OF MORPHEUS UNTIL THE PORTER KNOCKED AT OUR DOOR THE NEXT MORNING AS THE CLOCK OF THE TOWER STRUCK THE HOUR OF NINE
lbi-1585-157660-0007 OUR FIRST SIGHT OF SUNRISE IN LONDON GAVE US GREAT EXPECTATIONS OF FAME AND FORTUNE FOR SURELY ALL WE HAD WAS GLOWING EXPECTATIONS
lbi-1585-157660-0008 OFT EXPECTATION FAILS AND MOST OFT THERE WHERE MOST IT PROMISES AND OFT IT HITS WHERE HOPE IS COLDEST AND DESPAIR MOST FITS
lbi-1585-157660-0009 DEUCES WON DOUBLE AND SIXES TREBLE COIN
lbi-1585-157660-0010 WILLIAM TO THE GREAT AMAZEMENT OF THE DEALER FLUNG A GUINEA IN THE CENTER POT WHICH WAS IMMEDIATELY TAPPED BY JACK WHILE THE OTHERS LOOKED ON IN SILENT EXPECTATION
lbi-1585-157660-0011 THE POLITE JACK REPLIED ALL RIGHT SIR TAKE YOUR WORD FOR IT
lbi-1585-157660-0012 I HAVE SET MY LIFE UPON A CAST AND WILL STAND THE HAZARD OF THE DIE
lbi-1585-157660-0013 I IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED IN HIS FOOTSTEPS AND FOUND HIM JOKING WITH THE LANDLADY ABOUT A COUPLE OF INFANT BULL PUPS SHE WAS FONDLING IN HER CAPACIOUS LAP
lbi-1585-157660-0014 IF HE HAD DROPPED OUT OF THE CLOUDS WILLIAM COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE PLEASED OR SURPRISED AND THE FEELING WAS RECIPROCAL
lbi-1585-157660-0015 THE PRINTING SHOP OF FIELD WAS ONLY A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE DEVIL'S TAVERN AND WE WERE INVITED TO VISIT THE ESTABLISHMENT
lbi-1585-157660-0016 JAMES BURBAGE GAZED FOR A MOMENT ON THE MANLY FORM OF WILLIAM AND BLURTED OUT IN HIS BLUFF MANNER WHAT DO YOU KNOW
lbi-1630-102884-0000 IN MY RECENT TRAVELS IN THE WEST I HAVE FELT THAT OUT THERE FREEDOM AS AN IDEA HAS BECOME FEEBLE AND INEFFECTUAL
lbi-1630-102884-0001 THE SAME THING IS HAPPENING NOW WITH THE PEOPLE OF THE WEST
lbi-1630-102884-0002 THEY ARE FLATTERED INTO BELIEVING THAT THEY ARE FREE AND THEY HAVE THE SOVEREIGN POWER IN THEIR HANDS
lbi-1630-102884-0003 THUS IT HAS BECOME MORE AND MORE EVIDENT TO ME THAT THE IDEAL OF FREEDOM HAS GROWN TENUOUS IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE WEST
lbi-1630-102884-0004 THE MENTALITY IS THAT OF A SLAVE OWNING COMMUNITY WITH A MUTILATED MULTITUDE OF MEN TIED TO ITS COMMERCIAL AND POLITICAL TREADMILL
lbi-1630-102884-0005 HE WHO CARES TO HAVE SLAVES MUST CHAIN HIMSELF TO THEM HE WHO BUILDS WALLS TO CREATE EXCLUSION FOR OTHERS BUILDS WALLS ACROSS HIS OWN FREEDOM HE WHO DISTRUSTS FREEDOM IN OTHERS LOSES HIS MORAL RIGHT TO IT
lbi-1630-102884-0006 HAVE THEY ACQUIRED A TRUE LOVE OF FREEDOM
lbi-1630-102884-0007 THE GREAT EPIC OF THE SOUL OF OUR PEOPLE THE MAHABHARATA GIVES US A WONDERFUL VISION OF AN OVERFLOWING LIFE FULL OF THE FREEDOM OF INQUIRY AND EXPERIMENT
lbi-1630-102884-0008 WHEN THE AGE OF THE BUDDHA CAME HUMANITY WAS STIRRED IN OUR COUNTRY TO ITS UTTERMOST DEPTH
lbi-1630-102884-0009 IT HARDENED INTO AN AGE OF INERT CONSTRUCTION
lbi-1630-102884-0010 THE ORGANIC UNITY OF A VARIED AND ELASTIC SOCIETY GAVE WAY TO A CONVENTIONAL ORDER WHICH PROVED ITS ARTIFICIAL CHARACTER BY ITS INEXORABLE LAW OF EXCLUSION
lbi-1630-102884-0011 LIFE HAS ITS INEQUALITIES I ADMIT BUT THEY ARE NATURAL AND ARE IN HARMONY WITH OUR VITAL FUNCTIONS
lbi-1630-102884-0012 BY SQUEEZING HUMAN BEINGS IN THE GRIP OF AN INELASTIC SYSTEM AND FORCIBLY HOLDING THEM FIXED WE HAVE IGNORED THE LAWS OF LIFE AND GROWTH
lbi-1630-102884-0013 WE HAVE FORCED LIVING SOULS INTO A PERMANENT PASSIVITY MAKING THEM INCAPABLE OF MOULDING CIRCUMSTANCE TO THEIR OWN INTRINSIC DESIGN AND OF MASTERING THEIR OWN DESTINY
lbi-1630-102884-0014 OUR STUPEFACTION HAS BECOME SO ABSOLUTE THAT WE DO NOT EVEN REALISE THAT THIS PERSISTENT MISFORTUNE DOGGING OUR STEPS FOR AGES CANNOT BE A MERE ACCIDENT OF HISTORY REMOVABLE ONLY BY ANOTHER ACCIDENT FROM OUTSIDE
lbi-1630-102884-0015 THEY WILL BE INCAPABLE OF HOLDING A JUST FREEDOM IN POLITICS AND OF FIGHTING IN FREEDOM'S CAUSE
lbi-1630-102884-0016 IT REPRESENTS THE ACTIVE ASPECT OF INERTIA WHICH HAS THE APPEARANCE OF FREEDOM BUT NOT ITS TRUTH AND THEREFORE GIVES RISE TO SLAVERY BOTH WITHIN ITS BOUNDARIES AND OUTSIDE
lbi-1630-141772-0000 ON THE PRATZEN HEIGHTS WHERE HE HAD FALLEN WITH THE FLAGSTAFF IN HIS HAND LAY PRINCE ANDREW BOLKONSKI BLEEDING PROFUSELY AND UNCONSCIOUSLY UTTERING A GENTLE PITEOUS AND CHILDLIKE MOAN
lbi-1630-141772-0001 SUDDENLY HE AGAIN FELT THAT HE WAS ALIVE AND SUFFERING FROM A BURNING LACERATING PAIN IN HIS HEAD
lbi-1630-141772-0002 WAS HIS FIRST THOUGHT
lbi-1630-141772-0003 HE FEEBLY MOVED HIS LEG AND UTTERED A WEAK SICKLY GROAN WHICH AROUSED HIS OWN PITY
lbi-1630-141772-0004 LIFT THIS YOUNG MAN UP AND CARRY HIM TO THE DRESSING STATION
lbi-1630-141772-0005 PRINCE ANDREW REMEMBERED NOTHING MORE HE LOST CONSCIOUSNESS FROM THE TERRIBLE PAIN OF BEING LIFTED ONTO THE STRETCHER THE JOLTING WHILE BEING MOVED AND THE PROBING OF HIS WOUND AT THE DRESSING STATION
lbi-1630-141772-0006 DURING THIS TRANSFER HE FELT A LITTLE STRONGER AND WAS ABLE TO LOOK ABOUT HIM AND EVEN SPEAK
lbi-1630-141772-0007 HE ASKED ON SEEING THE PRISONERS
lbi-1630-141772-0008 I COMMANDED A SQUADRON REPLIED REPNIN
lbi-1630-141772-0009 PRINCE REPNIN NAMED LIEUTENANT SUKHTELEN
lbi-1630-141772-0010 AFTER LOOKING AT HIM NAPOLEON SMILED
lbi-1630-141772-0011 YOUTH IS NO HINDRANCE TO COURAGE MUTTERED SUKHTELEN IN A FAILING VOICE
lbi-1630-141772-0012 A SPLENDID REPLY SAID NAPOLEON
lbi-1630-141772-0013 PRINCE ANDREW WHO HAD ALSO BEEN BROUGHT FORWARD BEFORE THE EMPEROR'S EYES TO COMPLETE THE SHOW OF PRISONERS COULD NOT FAIL TO ATTRACT HIS ATTENTION
lbi-1630-141772-0014 HIS FACE SHONE WITH SELF SATISFACTION AND PLEASURE
lbi-1630-141772-0015 THE SOLDIERS WHO HAD CARRIED PRINCE ANDREW HAD NOTICED AND TAKEN THE LITTLE GOLD ICON PRINCESS MARY HAD HUNG ROUND HER BROTHER'S NECK BUT SEEING THE FAVOR THE EMPEROR SHOWED THE PRISONERS THEY NOW HASTENED TO RETURN THE HOLY IMAGE
lbi-1630-141772-0016 PRINCE ANDREW DID NOT SEE HOW AND BY WHOM IT WAS REPLACED BUT THE LITTLE ICON WITH ITS THIN GOLD CHAIN SUDDENLY APPEARED UPON HIS CHEST OUTSIDE HIS UNIFORM
lbi-1630-141772-0017 HOW GOOD IT WOULD BE TO KNOW WHERE TO SEEK FOR HELP IN THIS LIFE AND WHAT TO EXPECT AFTER IT BEYOND THE GRAVE
lbi-1630-141772-0018 HOW HAPPY AND CALM I SHOULD BE IF I COULD NOW SAY LORD HAVE MERCY ON ME
lbi-1630-141772-0019 EITHER TO A POWER INDEFINABLE INCOMPREHENSIBLE WHICH I NOT ONLY CANNOT ADDRESS BUT WHICH I CANNOT EVEN EXPRESS IN WORDS THE GREAT ALL OR NOTHING SAID HE TO HIMSELF OR TO THAT GOD WHO HAS BEEN SEWN INTO THIS AMULET BY MARY
lbi-1630-141772-0020 THE STRETCHERS MOVED ON
lbi-1630-141772-0021 THE QUIET HOME LIFE AND PEACEFUL HAPPINESS OF BALD HILLS PRESENTED ITSELF TO HIM
lbi-1630-141772-0022 HE IS A NERVOUS BILIOUS SUBJECT SAID LARREY AND WILL NOT RECOVER
lbi-1630-73710-0000 IT IS AT THE FOOT OF WOMAN THAT WE LAY THE LAURELS THAT WITHOUT HER SMILE WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN GAINED IT IS HER IMAGE THAT STRINGS THE LYRE OF THE POET THAT ANIMATES OUR VOICE IN THE BLAZE OF ELOQUENT FACTION AND GUIDES OUR BRAIN IN THE AUGUST TOILS OF STATELY COUNCILS
lbi-1630-73710-0001 IS THERE NO HOPE FOR THEM SO FULL OF HOPE
lbi-1630-73710-0002 IT MAKES THE HEART ACHE BUT TO PICTURE SUCH VICISSITUDES TO THE IMAGINATION
lbi-1630-73710-0003 THE KNOWLEDGE THAT SUCH CHANGES CAN OCCUR FLITS OVER THE MIND LIKE THE THOUGHT OF DEATH OBSCURING ALL OUR GAY FANCIES WITH ITS BAT LIKE WING AND TAINTING THE HEALTHY ATMOSPHERE OF OUR HAPPINESS WITH ITS VENOMOUS EXPIRATIONS
lbi-1630-73710-0004 MINE OWN
lbi-1630-73710-0005 WHAT DID WHAT COULD YOU DO
lbi-1630-73710-0006 I BEAT ABOUT MY CHAMBER LIKE A SILLY BIRD IN A CAGE
lbi-1630-73710-0007 DO NOT THINK OF MOVING TO DAY
lbi-1630-73710-0008 DO NOT KEEP THE MESSENGER AN INSTANT
lbi-1630-73710-0009 HE IS ON MY PONY
lbi-1630-73710-0010 WRITE ONLY ONE WORD TO YOUR OWN HENRIETTA
lbi-1630-73710-0011 FERDINAND TO HENRIETTA
lbi-1630-73710-0012 GOD BLESS YOU MY HENRIETTA MY BELOVED MY MATCHLESS HENRIETTA
lbi-1630-73710-0013 WHAT HAS THAT SEPARATION NOT COST ME
lbi-1630-73710-0014 PANGS THAT I COULD NOT CONCEIVE ANY HUMAN MISERY COULD OCCASION
lbi-1630-73710-0015 AND YET I OUGHT TO BE GRATEFUL THAT HE WAS UNINJURED LAST NIGHT
lbi-1630-73710-0016 I DARE NOT NOW OWN HOW FOOLISH I WAS
lbi-1630-73710-0017 DO NOT BE ANGRY WITH YOUR HENRIETTA BUT I AM NERVOUS ABOUT CONCEALING OUR ENGAGEMENT FROM PAPA
lbi-1630-73710-0018 DAYS MUST ELAPSE BEFORE YOU CAN REACH BATH AND I KNOW FERDINAND I KNOW YOUR OFFICE IS MORE DIFFICULT THAN YOU WILL CONFESS
lbi-1630-73710-0019 BUT COME BACK MY OWN AS SOON AS YOU CAN AND WRITE TO ME AT THE POST OFFICE AS YOU SETTLED
lbi-1630-73710-0020 THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT YOU ARE SO NEAR MAKES ME RESTLESS
lbi-1630-73710-0021 I WISH TO MEET HIM WITH AS MUCH CALMNESS AS I CAN COMMAND
lbi-1630-96099-0000 THAT TOO SIR YOU WILL OF COURSE UNDERTAKE
lbi-1630-96099-0001 THEN SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED HE HAS SOME SPECIAL INFORMATION SOME GREAT NEWS
lbi-1630-96099-0002 WHEN BLOCK APPEARED IT WAS EVIDENT THAT SOMETHING HAD GONE WRONG WITH HIM
lbi-1630-96099-0003 GONE NOW JUST WHEN WE MOST WANT HIM NEVER
lbi-1630-96099-0004 IDIOT TRIPLE IDIOT
lbi-1630-96099-0005 YOU SHALL BE DISMISSED DISCHARGED FROM THIS HOUR YOU ARE A DISGRACE TO THE FORCE
lbi-1630-96099-0006 IT IS THAT OR YOUR GREAT GLUTTONY
lbi-1630-96099-0007 MY GENTLEMAN MADE HIMSELF MOST PLEASANT
lbi-1630-96099-0008 WELL AT ANY RATE FOR MY SINS I ACCEPTED
lbi-1630-96099-0009 WE ENTERED THE FIRST RESTAURANT THAT OF THE REUNITED FRIENDS YOU KNOW IT PERHAPS MONSIEUR
lbi-1630-96099-0010 I HAD NO FEAR OF HIM NOT TILL THE VERY LAST WHEN HE PLAYED ME THIS EVIL TURN
lbi-1630-96099-0011 I SUSPECTED NOTHING WHEN HE BROUGHT OUT HIS POCKETBOOK IT WAS STUFFED FULL MONSIEUR I SAW THAT AND MY CONFIDENCE INCREASED CALLED FOR THE RECKONING AND PAID WITH AN ITALIAN BANK NOTE
lbi-1630-96099-0012 EXCUSE ME ONE MOMENT PRAY
lbi-1630-96099-0013 HE WENT OUT MONSIEUR AND PIFF PAFF HE WAS NO MORE TO BE SEEN
lbi-1630-96099-0014 WHY LET HIM OUT OF YOUR SIGHT
lbi-1630-96099-0015 IT WAS ONLY NOW AT THE ELEVENTH HOUR THAT THE ITALIAN HAD BECOME INCULPATED AND THE QUESTION OF HIS POSSIBLE ANXIETY TO ESCAPE HAD NEVER BEEN CONSIDERED
lbi-1630-96099-0016 HE LEFT EVERYTHING BEHIND
lbi-1630-96099-0017 HAND IT ME SAID THE CHIEF AND WHEN IT CAME INTO HIS HANDS HE BEGAN TO TURN OVER THE LEAVES HURRIEDLY
lbi-1630-96099-0018 I DO NOT UNDERSTAND NOT MORE THAN A WORD HERE AND THERE
lbi-1630-96099-0019 IT IS NO DOUBT ITALIAN
lbi-1630-96099-0020 OF COURSE SUCH A CONSUMMATE ASS AS YOU HAVE PROVED YOURSELF WOULD NOT THINK OF SEARCHING THE RESTAURANT OR THE IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD OR OF MAKING INQUIRIES AS TO WHETHER HE HAD BEEN SEEN OR AS TO WHICH WAY HE HAD GONE
lbi-1630-96099-0021 IT WAS A NOTE FOR A HUNDRED LIRE A HUNDRED FRANCS AND THE RESTAURANT BILL WAS NO MORE THAN SEVENTEEN FRANCS HAH
lbi-1630-96099-0022 HE WAS MUCH PRESSED IN A GREAT HURRY
lbi-1630-96099-0023 DIRECTLY HE CROSSED THE THRESHOLD HE CALLED THE FIRST CAB AND WAS DRIVING AWAY BUT HE WAS STOPPED THE DEVIL
lbi-1630-96099-0024 HE WISHED TO PASS ON TO LEAVE HER SHE WOULD NOT CONSENT THEN THEY BOTH GOT INTO THE CAB AND WERE DRIVEN AWAY TOGETHER
lbi-1650-157641-0000 THE SOCIAL ATTITUDE TOWARDS SMOKING IN EARLY VICTORIAN DAYS AND FOR SOME TIME LATER WAS CURIOUS
lbi-1650-157641-0001 NOW MISSUS QUILP HE SAYS I FEEL IN A SMOKING HUMOUR AND SHALL PROBABLY BLAZE AWAY ALL NIGHT
lbi-1650-157641-0002 BUT SIT WHERE YOU ARE IF YOU PLEASE IN CASE I WANT YOU
lbi-1650-157641-0003 THE DWARF'S TASTES HOWEVER WERE CATHOLIC
lbi-1650-157641-0004 BUT QUILP AND BRASS WERE NOT IN SOCIETY
lbi-1650-157641-0005 THERE WERE STILL PLENTY OF ACTIVE OPPONENTS AND DENOUNCERS OF TOBACCO
lbi-1650-157641-0006 ONE OF THE MOST DISTINGUISHED WAS THE GREAT DUKE OF WELLINGTON WHO ABOMINATED SMOKING AND WAS ANNOYED BY THE INCREASE OF CIGAR SMOKING AMONG OFFICERS OF THE ARMY
lbi-1650-157641-0007 THE LADIES HAD A KEEN SCENT FOR THE ABOMINABLE ODOUR OF TOBACCO AND DISTRUSTED THE MEN WHO SMOKED
lbi-1650-157641-0008 HERE IS FITZ BOODLE'S OR THACKERAY'S COMMENT ON IT WHAT IS THIS SMOKING THAT IT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A CRIME
lbi-1650-157641-0009 I BELIEVE IN MY HEART THAT WOMEN ARE JEALOUS OF IT AS OF A RIVAL
lbi-1650-157641-0010 I WOULD LAY A GUINEA THAT MANY A LADY WHO HAS JUST BEEN KIND ENOUGH TO READ THE ABOVE LINES LAYS DOWN THE BOOK AFTER THIS CONFESSION OF MINE THAT I AM A SMOKER AND SAYS OH THE VULGAR WRETCH AND PASSES ON TO SOMETHING ELSE
lbi-1650-157641-0011 GERMANY HAS BEEN PUFFING FOR THREE SCORE YEARS FRANCE SMOKES TO A MAN
lbi-1650-157641-0012 PSHA LOOK AT HIS PROGRESS
lbi-1650-157641-0013 THUS THE ODOUR OF TOBACCO WAS NOT BROUGHT INTO THE DRAWING ROOM
lbi-1650-157641-0014 THE JOURNALISTS AND BOHEMIANS WHO MET AT THE COGERS WERE ABOVE OR BELOW THE DICTATES OF FASHION AND SMOKING WAS ALWAYS A FEATURE OF THEIR GATHERINGS
lbi-1650-157641-0015 BOTH QUEEN VICTORIA AND THE PRINCE CONSORT DETESTED IT SO TOBACCO WAS TABOO WHEREVER THE COURT WAS
lbi-1650-167613-0000 THE OFFICERS WERE ABOUT TO TAKE LEAVE BUT PRINCE ANDREW APPARENTLY RELUCTANT TO BE LEFT ALONE WITH HIS FRIEND ASKED THEM TO STAY AND HAVE TEA
lbi-1650-167613-0001 SEATS WERE BROUGHT IN AND SO WAS THE TEA
lbi-1650-167613-0002 THE OFFICERS GAZED WITH SURPRISE AT PIERRE'S HUGE STOUT FIGURE AND LISTENED TO HIS TALK OF MOSCOW AND THE POSITION OF OUR ARMY ROUND WHICH HE HAD RIDDEN
lbi-1650-167613-0003 SO YOU UNDERSTAND THE WHOLE POSITION OF OUR TROOPS
lbi-1650-167613-0004 NOT BEING A MILITARY MAN I CAN'T SAY I HAVE UNDERSTOOD IT FULLY BUT I UNDERSTAND THE GENERAL POSITION
lbi-1650-167613-0005 WELL THEN YOU KNOW MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE BE IT WHO IT MAY SAID PRINCE ANDREW
lbi-1650-167613-0006 AND TELL ME YOUR OPINION OF BARCLAY DE TOLLY
lbi-1650-167613-0007 PIERRE LOOKED AT TIMOKHIN WITH THE CONDESCENDINGLY INTERROGATIVE SMILE WITH WHICH EVERYBODY INVOLUNTARILY ADDRESSED THAT OFFICER
lbi-1650-167613-0008 WE SEE LIGHT AGAIN SINCE HIS SERENITY HAS BEEN APPOINTED YOUR EXCELLENCY SAID TIMOKHIN TIMIDLY AND CONTINUALLY TURNING TO GLANCE AT HIS COLONEL
lbi-1650-167613-0009 WHY SO ASKED PIERRE
lbi-1650-167613-0010 THEN WHY WAS IT FORBIDDEN
lbi-1650-167613-0011 AT SMOLENSK TOO HE JUDGED CORRECTLY THAT THE FRENCH MIGHT OUTFLANK US AS THEY HAD LARGER FORCES
lbi-1650-167613-0012 HE ORDERED US TO RETREAT AND ALL OUR EFFORTS AND LOSSES WENT FOR NOTHING
lbi-1650-167613-0013 SO IT HAS BEEN WITH BARCLAY
lbi-1650-167613-0014 WHILE RUSSIA WAS WELL A FOREIGNER COULD SERVE HER AND BE A SPLENDID MINISTER BUT AS SOON AS SHE IS IN DANGER SHE NEEDS ONE OF HER OWN KIN
lbi-1650-167613-0015 AND THEY SAY HE'S A SKILLFUL COMMANDER REJOINED PIERRE
lbi-1650-167613-0016 I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT IS MEANT BY A SKILLFUL COMMANDER REPLIED PRINCE ANDREW IRONICALLY
lbi-1650-167613-0017 A SKILLFUL COMMANDER REPLIED PIERRE
lbi-1650-167613-0018 PIERRE LOOKED AT HIM IN SURPRISE
lbi-1650-167613-0019 AND YET THEY SAY THAT WAR IS LIKE A GAME OF CHESS HE REMARKED
lbi-1650-167613-0020 THE RELATIVE STRENGTH OF BODIES OF TROOPS CAN NEVER BE KNOWN TO ANYONE
lbi-1650-167613-0021 SUCCESS NEVER DEPENDS AND NEVER WILL DEPEND ON POSITION OR EQUIPMENT OR EVEN ON NUMBERS AND LEAST OF ALL ON POSITION BUT ON WHAT THEN
lbi-1650-167613-0022 ON THE FEELING THAT IS IN ME AND IN HIM HE POINTED TO TIMOKHIN AND IN EACH SOLDIER
lbi-1650-167613-0023 A BATTLE IS WON BY THOSE WHO FIRMLY RESOLVE TO WIN IT
lbi-1650-167613-0024 WHY DID WE LOSE THE BATTLE AT AUSTERLITZ
lbi-1650-167613-0025 WE'VE LOST SO LET US RUN AND WE RAN
lbi-1650-167613-0026 BUT TOMORROW WE SHAN'T SAY IT
lbi-1650-167613-0027 BUT WHAT AWAITS US TOMORROW
lbi-1650-167613-0028 THE FACT IS THAT THOSE MEN WITH WHOM YOU HAVE RIDDEN ROUND THE POSITION NOT ONLY DO NOT HELP MATTERS BUT HINDER
lbi-1650-167613-0029 THAT'S THE TRUTH THE REAL TRUTH SAID TIMOKHIN
lbi-1650-167613-0030 IT'S NOT THE DAY FOR THAT THEY SAY
lbi-1650-167613-0031 ALL WERE SILENT THE OFFICERS ROSE
lbi-1650-167613-0032 YES YES ANSWERED PRINCE ANDREW ABSENTLY
lbi-1650-167613-0033 THE FRENCH HAVE DESTROYED MY HOME AND ARE ON THEIR WAY TO DESTROY MOSCOW THEY HAVE OUTRAGED AND ARE OUTRAGING ME EVERY MOMENT THEY ARE MY ENEMIES
lbi-1650-167613-0034 IN MY OPINION THEY ARE ALL CRIMINALS
lbi-1650-167613-0035 AND SO THINKS TIMOKHIN AND THE WHOLE ARMY
lbi-1650-167613-0036 SINCE THEY ARE MY FOES THEY CANNOT BE MY FRIENDS WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN SAID AT TILSIT
lbi-1650-167613-0037 YES YES MUTTERED PIERRE LOOKING WITH SHINING EYES AT PRINCE ANDREW
lbi-1650-167613-0038 THEY TALK TO US OF THE RULES OF WAR OF CHIVALRY OF FLAGS OF TRUCE OF MERCY TO THE UNFORTUNATE AND SO ON IT'S ALL RUBBISH
lbi-1650-167613-0039 THEY PLUNDER OTHER PEOPLE'S HOUSES ISSUE FALSE PAPER MONEY AND WORST OF ALL THEY KILL MY CHILDREN AND MY FATHER AND THEN TALK OF RULES OF WAR AND MAGNANIMITY TO FOES
lbi-1650-167613-0040 TAKE NO PRISONERS BUT KILL AND BE KILLED
lbi-1650-167613-0041 PRINCE ANDREW WHO HAD THOUGHT IT WAS ALL THE SAME TO HIM WHETHER OR NOT MOSCOW WAS TAKEN AS SMOLENSK HAD BEEN WAS SUDDENLY CHECKED IN HIS SPEECH BY AN UNEXPECTED CRAMP IN HIS THROAT
lbi-1650-167613-0042 HE PACED UP AND DOWN A FEW TIMES IN SILENCE BUT HIS EYES GLITTERED FEVERISHLY AND HIS LIPS QUIVERED AS HE BEGAN SPEAKING
lbi-1650-167613-0043 AND WHEN THERE WAS A WAR LIKE THIS ONE IT WOULD BE WAR
lbi-1650-167613-0044 WHAT IS NEEDED FOR SUCCESS IN WARFARE
lbi-1650-167613-0045 AND IN SPITE OF ALL THIS IT IS THE HIGHEST CLASS RESPECTED BY EVERYONE
lbi-1650-167613-0046 HOW DOES GOD ABOVE LOOK AT THEM AND HEAR THEM
lbi-1650-167613-0047 I SEE THAT I HAVE BEGUN TO UNDERSTAND TOO MUCH
lbi-1650-167613-0048 AND IT DOESN'T DO FOR MAN TO TASTE OF THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL AH WELL IT'S NOT FOR LONG HE ADDED
lbi-1650-167613-0049 HOWEVER YOU'RE SLEEPY AND IT'S TIME FOR ME TO SLEEP
lbi-1650-167613-0050 GO BACK TO GORKI SAID PRINCE ANDREW SUDDENLY
lbi-1650-167613-0051 GO GO BEFORE A BATTLE ONE MUST HAVE ONE'S SLEEP OUT REPEATED PRINCE ANDREW
lbi-1650-167613-0052 NO HE DOES NOT WANT IT PIERRE CONCLUDED
lbi-1650-167613-0053 AND I KNOW THAT THIS IS OUR LAST MEETING
lbi-1650-167613-0054 ONE PICTURE SUCCEEDED ANOTHER IN HIS IMAGINATION
lbi-1650-167613-0055 ON ONE OF THEM HE DWELT LONG AND JOYFULLY
lbi-1650-173551-0000 HIS MAJOR DOMO CAME IN A SECOND TIME TO SAY THAT THE FRENCHMAN WHO HAD BROUGHT THE LETTER FROM THE COUNTESS WAS VERY ANXIOUS TO SEE HIM IF ONLY FOR A MINUTE AND THAT SOMEONE FROM BAZDEEV'S WIDOW HAD CALLED TO ASK PIERRE TO TAKE CHARGE OF HER HUSBAND'S BOOKS AS SHE HERSELF WAS LEAVING FOR THE COUNTRY
lbi-1650-173551-0001 THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE PASSAGE
lbi-1650-173551-0002 THE HALL PORTER WAS STANDING AT THE FRONT DOOR
lbi-1650-173551-0003 FROM THE LANDING WHERE PIERRE STOOD THERE WAS A SECOND STAIRCASE LEADING TO THE BACK ENTRANCE
lbi-1650-173551-0004 HE WENT DOWN THAT STAIRCASE AND OUT INTO THE YARD NO ONE HAD SEEN HIM
lbi-1650-173551-0005 WHEN HE FELT HE WAS BEING LOOKED AT HE BEHAVED LIKE AN OSTRICH WHICH HIDES ITS HEAD IN A BUSH IN ORDER NOT TO BE SEEN HE HUNG HIS HEAD AND QUICKENING HIS PACE WENT DOWN THE STREET
lbi-1650-173551-0006 HE HIRED THE FIRST CAB HE MET AND TOLD THE DRIVER TO GO TO THE PATRIARCH'S PONDS WHERE THE WIDOW BAZDEEV'S HOUSE WAS
lbi-1650-173551-0007 THIS WAS THE AUTHENTIC SCOTCH ACTS WITH BAZDEEV'S NOTES AND EXPLANATIONS
lbi-1650-173551-0008 HE SAT DOWN AT THE DUSTY WRITING TABLE AND HAVING LAID THE MANUSCRIPTS BEFORE HIM OPENED THEM OUT CLOSED THEM FINALLY PUSHED THEM AWAY AND RESTING HIS HEAD ON HIS HAND SANK INTO MEDITATION
lbi-1650-173551-0009 MAKAR ALEXEEVICH CAME TWICE THAT EVENING SHUFFLING ALONG IN HIS GALOSHES AS FAR AS THE DOOR AND STOPPED AND LOOKED INGRATIATINGLY AT PIERRE
lbi-1650-173552-0000 AT THAT VERY TIME AT TEN IN THE MORNING OF THE SECOND OF SEPTEMBER NAPOLEON WAS STANDING AMONG HIS TROOPS ON THE POKLONNY HILL LOOKING AT THE PANORAMA SPREAD OUT BEFORE HIM
lbi-1650-173552-0001 THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE MORNING WAS MAGICAL
lbi-1650-173552-0002 BUT MY CLEMENCY IS ALWAYS READY TO DESCEND UPON THE VANQUISHED
lbi-1650-173552-0003 YET HERE SHE IS LYING AT MY FEET WITH HER GOLDEN DOMES AND CROSSES SCINTILLATING AND TWINKLING IN THE SUNSHINE
lbi-1650-173552-0004 BUT I SHALL SPARE HER
lbi-1650-173552-0005 FROM THE HEIGHT OF THE KREMLIN YES THERE IS THE KREMLIN YES I WILL GIVE THEM JUST LAWS I WILL TEACH THEM THE MEANING OF TRUE CIVILIZATION I WILL MAKE GENERATIONS OF BOYARS REMEMBER THEIR CONQUEROR WITH LOVE
lbi-1650-173552-0006 I WILL TELL THE DEPUTATION THAT I DID NOT AND DO NOT DESIRE WAR THAT I HAVE WAGED WAR ONLY AGAINST THE FALSE POLICY OF THEIR COURT THAT I LOVE AND RESPECT ALEXANDER AND THAT IN MOSCOW I WILL ACCEPT TERMS OF PEACE WORTHY OF MYSELF AND OF MY PEOPLE
lbi-1650-173552-0007 I DO NOT WISH TO UTILIZE THE FORTUNES OF WAR TO HUMILIATE AN HONORED MONARCH
lbi-1650-173552-0008 HE WILL HAVE TO BE TOLD ALL THE SAME SAID SOME GENTLEMEN OF THE SUITE BUT GENTLEMEN
lbi-1650-173552-0009 A SINGLE REPORT OF A SIGNALING GUN FOLLOWED AND THE TROOPS WHO WERE ALREADY SPREAD OUT ON DIFFERENT SIDES OF MOSCOW MOVED INTO THE CITY THROUGH TVER KALUGA AND DOROGOMILOV GATES
lbi-1651-136854-0000 IN SEVENTEEN FIFTY HE CAME FORTH IN THE CHARACTER FOR WHICH HE WAS EMINENTLY QUALIFIED A MAJESTICK TEACHER OF MORAL AND RELIGIOUS WISDOM
lbi-1651-136854-0001 THE VEHICLE WHICH HE CHOSE WAS THAT OF A PERIODICAL PAPER WHICH HE KNEW HAD BEEN UPON FORMER OCCASIONS EMPLOYED WITH GREAT SUCCESS
lbi-1651-136854-0002 WHEN I WAS TO BEGIN PUBLISHING THAT PAPER I WAS AT A LOSS HOW TO NAME IT
lbi-1651-136854-0003 I SAT DOWN AT NIGHT UPON MY BEDSIDE AND RESOLVED THAT I WOULD NOT GO TO SLEEP TILL I HAD FIXED ITS TITLE
lbi-1651-136854-0004 ADDISON'S NOTE WAS A FICTION IN WHICH UNCONNECTED FRAGMENTS OF HIS LUCUBRATIONS WERE PURPOSELY JUMBLED TOGETHER IN AS ODD A MANNER AS HE COULD IN ORDER TO PRODUCE A LAUGHABLE EFFECT
lbi-1651-136854-0005 WHEREAS JOHNSON'S ABBREVIATIONS ARE ALL DISTINCT AND APPLICABLE TO EACH SUBJECT OF WHICH THE HEAD IS MENTIONED
lbi-1651-136854-0006 FOR INSTANCE THERE IS THE FOLLOWING SPECIMEN
lbi-1651-136854-0007 PUBLICK CALAMITIES NO SENSE OF THE PREVALENCE OF BAD HABITS NEGLIGENT OF TIME READY TO UNDERTAKE CARELESS TO PURSUE ALL CHANGED BY TIME
lbi-1651-136854-0008 CONFIDENT OF OTHERS UNSUSPECTING AS UNEXPERIENCED IMAGINING HIMSELF SECURE AGAINST NEGLECT NEVER IMAGINES THEY WILL VENTURE TO TREAT HIM ILL READY TO TRUST EXPECTING TO BE TRUSTED
lbi-1651-136854-0009 YOUTH AMBITIOUS AS THINKING HONOURS EASY TO BE HAD
lbi-1651-136854-0010 DIFFERENT KINDS OF PRAISE PURSUED AT DIFFERENT PERIODS
lbi-1651-136854-0011 OF THE FANCY IN MANHOOD
lbi-1651-136854-0012 BRUY
lbi-1651-136854-0013 SCHOLAR'S FRIENDSHIP LIKE LADIES
lbi-1651-136854-0014 DRAWN TO MAN BY WORDS REPELLED BY PASSIONS
lbi-1651-136854-0015 COMMON DANGER UNITES BY CRUSHING OTHER PASSIONS BUT THEY RETURN
lbi-1651-136854-0016 EQUALITY HINDERS COMPLIANCE
lbi-1651-136854-0017 SUPERIORITY PRODUCES INSOLENCE AND ENVY
lbi-1651-136854-0018 TOO MUCH REGARD IN EACH TO PRIVATE INTEREST TOO LITTLE
lbi-1651-136854-0019 OF CONFEDERACY WITH SUPERIOURS EVERY ONE KNOWS THE INCONVENIENCE
lbi-1651-136854-0020 WITH EQUALS NO AUTHORITY EVERY MAN HIS OWN OPINION HIS OWN INTEREST
lbi-1651-136854-0021 MAN AND WIFE HARDLY UNITED SCARCE EVER WITHOUT CHILDREN
lbi-1651-136854-0022 COMPUTATION IF TWO TO ONE AGAINST TWO HOW MANY AGAINST FIVE
lbi-1651-136854-0023 IN THIS AS IN MANY OTHER CASES I GO WRONG IN OPPOSITION TO CONVICTION FOR I THINK SCARCE ANY TEMPORAL GOOD EQUALLY TO BE DESIRED WITH THE REGARD AND FAMILIARITY OF WORTHY MEN
lbi-1651-136854-0024 I HOPE WE SHALL BE SOME TIME NEARER TO EACH OTHER AND HAVE A MORE READY WAY OF POURING OUT OUR HEARTS
lbi-1651-136854-0025 THE GREATEST BENEFIT WHICH ONE FRIEND CAN CONFER UPON ANOTHER IS TO GUARD AND EXCITE AND ELEVATE HIS VIRTUES
lbi-1651-136854-0026 THIS YOUR MOTHER WILL STILL PERFORM IF YOU DILIGENTLY PRESERVE THE MEMORY OF HER LIFE AND OF HER DEATH A LIFE SO FAR AS I CAN LEARN USEFUL WISE AND INNOCENT AND A DEATH RESIGNED PEACEFUL AND HOLY
lbi-1651-136854-0027 I CANNOT FORBEAR TO MENTION THAT NEITHER REASON NOR REVELATION DENIES YOU TO HOPE THAT YOU MAY INCREASE HER HAPPINESS BY OBEYING HER PRECEPTS AND THAT SHE MAY IN HER PRESENT STATE LOOK WITH PLEASURE UPON EVERY ACT OF VIRTUE TO WHICH HER INSTRUCTIONS OR EXAMPLE HAVE CONTRIBUTED
lbi-1651-136854-0028 IF YOU WRITE DOWN MINUTELY WHAT YOU REMEMBER OF HER FROM YOUR EARLIEST YEARS YOU WILL READ IT WITH GREAT PLEASURE AND RECEIVE FROM IT MANY HINTS OF SOOTHING RECOLLECTION WHEN TIME SHALL REMOVE HER YET FARTHER FROM YOU AND YOUR GRIEF SHALL BE MATURED TO VENERATION
lbi-1651-136854-0029 NO THIRTY TWO ON PATIENCE EVEN UNDER EXTREME MISERY IS WONDERFULLY LOFTY AND AS MUCH ABOVE THE RANT OF STOICISM AS THE SUN OF REVELATION IS BRIGHTER THAN THE TWILIGHT OF PAGAN PHILOSOPHY
lbi-1651-136854-0030 IT MUST INDEED BE ALLOWED THAT THE STRUCTURE OF HIS SENTENCES IS EXPANDED AND OFTEN HAS SOMEWHAT OF THE INVERSION OF LATIN AND THAT HE DELIGHTED TO EXPRESS FAMILIAR THOUGHTS IN PHILOSOPHICAL LANGUAGE BEING IN THIS THE REVERSE OF SOCRATES WHO IT WAS SAID REDUCED PHILOSOPHY TO THE SIMPLICITY OF COMMON LIFE
lbi-1651-136854-0031 THIS IDLE CHARGE HAS BEEN ECHOED FROM ONE BABBLER TO ANOTHER WHO HAVE CONFOUNDED JOHNSON'S ESSAYS WITH JOHNSON'S DICTIONARY AND BECAUSE HE THOUGHT IT RIGHT IN A LEXICON OF OUR LANGUAGE TO COLLECT MANY WORDS WHICH HAD FALLEN INTO DISUSE BUT WERE SUPPORTED BY GREAT AUTHORITIES IT HAS BEEN IMAGINED THAT ALL OF THESE HAVE BEEN INTERWOVEN INTO HIS OWN COMPOSITIONS
lbi-1651-136854-0032 THEIR STYLES DIFFER AS PLAIN CLOTH AND BROCADE
lbi-1686-142278-0000 HE WAS GONE
lbi-1686-142278-0001 NO MORE DEEP BLUE SKIES OR CRIMSON AND AMBER TINTS
lbi-1686-142278-0002 SHE SAT BY HERSELF AT THE FIRE WITH UNLIGHTED CANDLES ON THE TABLE BEHIND HER THINKING OVER THE DAY THE HAPPY WALK HAPPY SKETCHING CHEERFUL PLEASANT DINNER AND THE UNCOMFORTABLE MISERABLE WALK IN THE GARDEN
lbi-1686-142278-0003 HERE WAS SHE DISTURBED AND UNHAPPY BECAUSE HER INSTINCT HAD MADE ANYTHING BUT A REFUSAL IMPOSSIBLE WHILE HE NOT MANY MINUTES AFTER HE HAD MET WITH A REJECTION OF WHAT OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN THE DEEPEST HOLIEST PROPOSAL OF HIS LIFE COULD SPEAK AS IF BRIEFS SUCCESS AND ALL ITS SUPERFICIAL CONSEQUENCES OF A GOOD HOUSE CLEVER AND AGREEABLE SOCIETY WERE THE SOLE AVOWED OBJECTS OF HIS DESIRES OH DEAR
lbi-1686-142278-0004 HER MOTHER CAME INTO THE ROOM BEFORE THIS WHIRL OF THOUGHTS WAS ADJUSTED INTO ANYTHING LIKE ORDER
lbi-1686-142278-0005 MISTER HALE SIPPED HIS TEA IN ABSTRACTED SILENCE MARGARET HAD THE RESPONSES ALL TO HERSELF
lbi-1686-142278-0006 SHE FORGOT THAT HE HAD NOT MADE THEM AN OFFER
lbi-1686-142278-0007 MARGARET WAS PREPARING HER MOTHER'S WORSTED WORK AND RATHER SHRINKING FROM THE THOUGHT OF THE LONG EVENING AND WISHING BED TIME WERE COME THAT SHE MIGHT GO OVER THE EVENTS OF THE DAY AGAIN
lbi-1686-142278-0008 MARGARET
lbi-1686-142278-0009 I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING VERY SERIOUS TO US ALL
lbi-1686-142278-0010 VERY SERIOUS TO US ALL
lbi-1686-142278-0011 MISTER LENNOX HAD NEVER HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF HAVING ANY PRIVATE CONVERSATION WITH HER FATHER AFTER HER REFUSAL OR ELSE THAT WOULD INDEED BE A VERY SERIOUS AFFAIR
lbi-1686-142278-0012 BUT SHE SOON FELT IT WAS NOT ABOUT ANYTHING WHICH HAVING ONLY LATELY AND SUDDENLY OCCURRED COULD HAVE GIVEN RISE TO ANY COMPLICATED THOUGHTS THAT HER FATHER WISHED TO SPEAK TO HER
lbi-1686-142278-0013 MISTER HALE DID NOT ANSWER FOR A MINUTE OR TWO
lbi-1686-142278-0014 MARGARET COULD NOT BEAR THE SIGHT OF THE SUSPENSE WHICH WAS EVEN MORE DISTRESSING TO HER FATHER THAN TO HERSELF
lbi-1686-142278-0015 BUT WHY DEAR PAPA DO TELL ME
lbi-1686-142278-0016 BECAUSE I MUST NO LONGER BE A MINISTER IN THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND
lbi-1686-142278-0017 BUT NOTHING TO THE SHOCK SHE RECEIVED FROM MISTER HALE'S LAST SPEECH WHAT COULD HE MEAN
lbi-1686-142278-0018 IT WAS ALL THE WORSE FOR BEING SO MYSTERIOUS
lbi-1686-142278-0019 WHY CAN YOU NO LONGER BE A CLERGYMAN
lbi-1686-142278-0020 SURELY IF THE BISHOP WERE TOLD ALL WE KNOW ABOUT FREDERICK AND THE HARD UNJUST
lbi-1686-142278-0021 MARGARET I WILL TELL YOU ABOUT IT
lbi-1686-142278-0022 I WILL ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THIS ONCE BUT AFTER TO NIGHT LET US NEVER SPEAK OF IT AGAIN
lbi-1686-142278-0023 I CAN MEET THE CONSEQUENCES OF MY PAINFUL MISERABLE DOUBTS BUT IT IS AN EFFORT BEYOND ME TO SPEAK OF WHAT HAS CAUSED ME SO MUCH SUFFERING
lbi-1686-142278-0024 NO NOT DOUBTS AS TO RELIGION NOT THE SLIGHTEST INJURY TO THAT HE PAUSED
lbi-1686-142278-0025 MARGARET SIGHED AS IF STANDING ON THE VERGE OF SOME NEW HORROR
lbi-1686-142278-0026 MARGARET HOW I LOVE THE HOLY CHURCH FROM WHICH I AM TO BE SHUT OUT
lbi-1686-142278-0027 HE COULD NOT GO ON FOR A MOMENT OR TWO
lbi-1686-142278-0028 MARGARET COULD NOT TELL WHAT TO SAY IT SEEMED TO HER AS TERRIBLY MYSTERIOUS AS IF HER FATHER WERE ABOUT TO TURN MAHOMETAN
lbi-1686-142278-0029 THE ONE STAID FOUNDATION OF HER HOME OF HER IDEA OF HER BELOVED FATHER SEEMED REELING AND ROCKING
lbi-1686-142278-0030 HE SWALLOWED DOWN THE DRY CHOKING SOBS WHICH HAD BEEN HEAVING UP FROM HIS HEART HITHERTO AND GOING TO HIS BOOKCASE HE TOOK DOWN A VOLUME WHICH HE HAD OFTEN BEEN READING LATELY AND FROM WHICH HE THOUGHT HE HAD DERIVED STRENGTH TO ENTER UPON THE COURSE IN WHICH HE WAS NOW EMBARKED
lbi-1686-142278-0031 LISTEN DEAR MARGARET SAID HE PUTTING ONE ARM ROUND HER WAIST
lbi-1686-142278-0032 WHEN GOD WILL NOT USE THEE IN ONE KIND YET HE WILL IN ANOTHER
lbi-1686-142278-0033 IF WHEN THOU ART CHARGED WITH CORRUPTING GOD'S WORSHIP FALSIFYING THY VOWS THOU PRETENDEST A NECESSITY FOR IT IN ORDER TO A CONTINUANCE IN THE MINISTRY
lbi-1686-142278-0034 AS HE READ THIS AND GLANCED AT MUCH MORE WHICH HE DID NOT READ HE GAINED RESOLUTION FOR HIMSELF AND FELT AS IF HE TOO COULD BE BRAVE AND FIRM IN DOING WHAT HE BELIEVED TO BE RIGHT BUT AS HE CEASED HE HEARD MARGARET'S LOW CONVULSIVE SOB AND HIS COURAGE SANK DOWN UNDER THE KEEN SENSE OF SUFFERING
lbi-1686-142278-0035 I HAVE BORNE LONG WITH SELF REPROACH THAT WOULD HAVE ROUSED ANY MIND LESS TORPID AND COWARDLY THAN MINE
lbi-1686-142278-0036 HE SHOOK HIS HEAD AS HE WENT ON
lbi-1686-142278-0037 MARGARET I TRIED TO DO IT I TRIED TO CONTENT MYSELF WITH SIMPLY REFUSING THE ADDITIONAL PREFERMENT AND STOPPING QUIETLY HERE STRANGLING MY CONSCIENCE NOW AS I HAD STRAINED IT BEFORE
lbi-1686-142278-0038 GOD FORGIVE ME
lbi-1686-142278-0039 HE ROSE AND WALKED UP AND DOWN THE ROOM SPEAKING LOW WORDS OF SELF REPROACH AND HUMILIATION OF WHICH MARGARET WAS THANKFUL TO HEAR BUT FEW
lbi-1686-142278-0040 MARGARET I RETURN TO THE OLD SAD BURDEN WE MUST LEAVE HELSTONE
lbi-1686-142278-0041 YES
lbi-1686-142278-0042 I HAVE WRITTEN TO THE BISHOP I DARE SAY I HAVE TOLD YOU SO BUT I FORGET THINGS JUST NOW SAID MISTER HALE COLLAPSING INTO HIS DEPRESSED MANNER AS SOON AS HE CAME TO TALK OF HARD MATTER OF FACT DETAILS INFORMING HIM OF MY INTENTION TO RESIGN THIS VICARAGE
lbi-1686-142278-0043 THEY ARE BUT WHAT I HAVE TRIED UPON MYSELF WITHOUT AVAIL
lbi-1686-142278-0044 THAT WILL BE A TRIAL BUT WORSE FAR WORSE WILL BE THE PARTING FROM MY DEAR PEOPLE
lbi-1686-142278-0045 HE WILL COME TO STAY WITH US TO MORROW
lbi-1686-142278-0046 WAS IT TO BE SO SUDDEN THEN
lbi-1686-142278-0047 WHAT DOES MAMMA SAY
lbi-1686-142278-0048 MARGARET I AM A POOR COWARD AFTER ALL I CANNOT BEAR TO GIVE PAIN
lbi-1686-142278-0049 YES INDEED SHE MUST SAID MARGARET
lbi-1686-142278-0050 PERHAPS AFTER ALL SHE MAY NOT OH YES
lbi-1686-142278-0051 SHE WILL SHE MUST BE SHOCKED' AS THE FORCE OF THE BLOW RETURNED UPON HERSELF IN TRYING TO REALISE HOW ANOTHER WOULD TAKE IT
lbi-1686-142278-0052 TO MILTON NORTHERN HE ANSWERED WITH A DULL INDIFFERENCE FOR HE HAD PERCEIVED THAT ALTHOUGH HIS DAUGHTER'S LOVE HAD MADE HER CLING TO HIM AND FOR A MOMENT STRIVE TO SOOTHE HIM WITH HER LOVE YET THE KEENNESS OF THE PAIN WAS AS FRESH AS EVER IN HER MIND
lbi-1686-142278-0053 MILTON NORTHERN
lbi-1686-142278-0054 YES SAID HE IN THE SAME DESPONDENT INDIFFERENT WAY
lbi-1686-142278-0055 BUT HE WITH HIS QUICK INTUITIVE SYMPATHY READ IN HER FACE AS IN A MIRROR THE REFLECTIONS OF HIS OWN MOODY DEPRESSION AND TURNED IT OFF WITH AN EFFORT
lbi-1686-142278-0056 YOU SHALL BE TOLD ALL MARGARET
lbi-1686-142278-0057 ONLY HELP ME TO TELL YOUR MOTHER
lbi-1686-142278-0058 I AM GOING OUT FOR THE DAY TO BID FARMER DOBSON AND THE POOR PEOPLE ON BRACY COMMON GOOD BYE
lbi-1686-142278-0059 WOULD YOU DISLIKE BREAKING IT TO HER VERY MUCH MARGARET
lbi-1686-142278-0060 MARGARET DID DISLIKE IT DID SHRINK FROM IT MORE THAN FROM ANYTHING SHE HAD EVER HAD TO DO IN HER LIFE BEFORE
lbi-1686-142278-0061 MISTER HALE SHOOK HIS HEAD DESPONDINGLY HE PRESSED HER HAND IN TOKEN OF GRATITUDE
lbi-1686-142278-0062 MARGARET WAS NEARLY UPSET AGAIN INTO A BURST OF CRYING
lbi-1686-142278-0063 TO TURN HER THOUGHTS SHE SAID NOW TELL ME PAPA WHAT OUR PLANS ARE
lbi-1686-142278-0064 YOU AND MAMMA HAVE SOME MONEY INDEPENDENT OF THE INCOME FROM THE LIVING HAVE NOT YOU AUNT SHAW HAS I KNOW
lbi-1686-142278-0065 SEVENTY OF THAT HAS ALWAYS GONE TO FREDERICK SINCE HE HAS BEEN ABROAD
lbi-1686-142278-0066 HE MUST HAVE SOME PAY FOR SERVING WITH THE SPANISH ARMY
lbi-1686-142278-0067 FREDERICK MUST NOT SUFFER SAID MARGARET DECIDEDLY IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY SO UNJUSTLY TREATED BY HIS OWN A HUNDRED IS LEFT
lbi-1686-142278-0068 NO
lbi-1686-142278-0069 SAID MISTER HALE THAT WOULD NOT ANSWER I MUST DO SOMETHING
lbi-1686-142278-0070 I CAN ALWAYS DECIDE BETTER BY MYSELF AND NOT INFLUENCED BY THOSE WHOM I LOVE SAID HE AS A HALF APOLOGY FOR HAVING ARRANGED SO MUCH BEFORE HE HAD TOLD ANY ONE OF HIS FAMILY OF HIS INTENTIONS
lbi-1686-142278-0071 I CANNOT STAND OBJECTIONS
lbi-1686-142278-0072 THEY MAKE ME SO UNDECIDED
lbi-1686-142278-0073 MISTER HALE CONTINUED A FEW MONTHS AGO WHEN MY MISERY OF DOUBT BECAME MORE THAN I COULD BEAR WITHOUT SPEAKING I WROTE TO MISTER BELL YOU REMEMBER MISTER BELL MARGARET
lbi-1686-142278-0074 NO I NEVER SAW HIM I THINK
lbi-1686-142278-0075 AT ANY RATE HE HAS PROPERTY THERE WHICH HAS VERY MUCH INCREASED IN VALUE SINCE MILTON HAS BECOME SUCH A LARGE MANUFACTURING TOWN
lbi-1686-142278-0076 I DON'T KNOW THAT HE GAVE ME MUCH STRENGTH
lbi-1686-142278-0077 A PRIVATE TUTOR
lbi-1686-142278-0078 SAID MARGARET LOOKING SCORNFUL WHAT IN THE WORLD DO MANUFACTURERS WANT WITH THE CLASSICS OR LITERATURE OR THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF A GENTLEMAN
lbi-1686-142278-0079 OH SAID HER FATHER SOME OF THEM REALLY SEEM TO BE FINE FELLOWS CONSCIOUS OF THEIR OWN DEFICIENCIES WHICH IS MORE THAN MANY A MAN AT OXFORD IS
lbi-1686-142278-0080 SOME WANT THEIR CHILDREN TO BE BETTER INSTRUCTED THAN THEY THEMSELVES HAVE BEEN
lbi-1686-142278-0081 AND IN MILTON MARGARET I SHALL FIND A BUSY LIFE IF NOT A HAPPY ONE AND PEOPLE AND SCENES SO DIFFERENT THAT I SHALL NEVER BE REMINDED OF HELSTONE
lbi-1686-142278-0082 DISCORDANT AS IT WAS WITH ALMOST A DETESTATION FOR ALL SHE HAD EVER HEARD OF THE NORTH OF ENGLAND THE MANUFACTURERS THE PEOPLE THE WILD AND BLEAK COUNTRY THERE WAS THIS ONE RECOMMENDATION IT WOULD BE DIFFERENT FROM HELSTONE AND COULD NEVER REMIND THEM OF THAT BELOVED PLACE
lbi-1686-142278-0083 WHEN DO WE GO
lbi-1686-142278-0084 I DO NOT KNOW EXACTLY
lbi-1686-142278-0085 I WANTED TO TALK IT OVER WITH YOU
lbi-1686-142278-0086 YOU SEE YOUR MOTHER KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT IT YET BUT I THINK IN A FORTNIGHT AFTER MY DEED OF RESIGNATION IS SENT IN I SHALL HAVE NO RIGHT TO REMAIN
lbi-1686-142278-0087 MARGARET WAS ALMOST STUNNED
lbi-1686-142278-0088 BUT SHE RECOVERED HERSELF IMMEDIATELY
lbi-1686-142278-0089 YES PAPA IT HAD BETTER BE FIXED SOON AND DECIDEDLY AS YOU SAY

lbi-1686-142278-0092 NO SAID MARGARET SADLY I WILL DO IT
lbi-1686-142278-0093 YOU MUST NOT DECEIVE YOURSELF INTO DOUBTING THE REALITY OF MY WORDS MY FIXED INTENTION AND RESOLVE
lbi-1686-142278-0094 HE LOOKED AT HER IN THE SAME STEADY STONY MANNER FOR SOME MOMENTS AFTER HE HAD DONE SPEAKING
lbi-1686-142278-0095 THE BLESSING OF GOD BE UPON THEE MY CHILD
lbi-1686-142278-0096 THE NEXT MOMENT SHE FEARED LEST THIS ANSWER TO HIS BLESSING MIGHT BE IRREVERENT WRONG MIGHT HURT HIM AS COMING FROM HIS DAUGHTER AND SHE THREW HER ARMS ROUND HIS NECK
lbi-1686-142278-0097 SHE HEARD HIM MURMUR TO HIMSELF THE MARTYRS AND CONFESSORS HAD EVEN MORE PAIN TO BEAR I WILL NOT SHRINK
lbi-1686-142278-0098 THEY WERE STARTLED BY HEARING MISSUS HALE INQUIRING FOR HER DAUGHTER
lbi-1701-141759-0000 IT WAS LONG SINCE THE ROSTOVS HAD NEWS OF NICHOLAS
lbi-1701-141759-0001 NOT TILL MIDWINTER WAS THE COUNT AT LAST HANDED A LETTER ADDRESSED IN HIS SON'S HANDWRITING
lbi-1701-141759-0002 ON RECEIVING IT HE RAN ON TIPTOE TO HIS STUDY IN ALARM AND HASTE TRYING TO ESCAPE NOTICE CLOSED THE DOOR AND BEGAN TO READ THE LETTER
lbi-1701-141759-0003 EACH TIME THAT THESE HINTS BEGAN TO MAKE THE COUNTESS ANXIOUS AND SHE GLANCED UNEASILY AT THE COUNT AND AT ANNA MIKHAYLOVNA THE LATTER VERY ADROITLY TURNED THE CONVERSATION TO INSIGNIFICANT MATTERS
lbi-1701-141759-0004 BUT FOR GOD'S SAKE BE CAREFUL YOU KNOW HOW IT MAY AFFECT YOUR MAMMA
lbi-1701-141759-0005 NO ON MY TRUE WORD OF HONOR SAID NATASHA CROSSING HERSELF I WON'T TELL ANYONE
lbi-1701-141759-0006 AND SHE RAN OFF AT ONCE TO SONYA
lbi-1701-141759-0007 SHE RUSHED TO SONYA HUGGED HER AND BEGAN TO CRY
lbi-1701-141759-0008 IT'S TRUE THAT ALL YOU WOMEN ARE CRYBABIES REMARKED PETYA PACING THE ROOM WITH LARGE RESOLUTE STRIDES
lbi-1701-141759-0009 YOU ARE ALL BLUBBERERS AND UNDERSTAND NOTHING
lbi-1701-141759-0010 NATASHA SMILED THROUGH HER TEARS
lbi-1701-141759-0011 WHAT NASTY BRUTES THEY ARE
lbi-1701-141759-0012 HOLD YOUR TONGUE PETYA WHAT A GOOSE YOU ARE
lbi-1701-141759-0013 SONYA SMILED DO I REMEMBER NICHOLAS
lbi-1701-141759-0014 I REMEMBER NIKOLENKA TOO I REMEMBER HIM WELL SHE SAID
lbi-1701-141759-0015 NO SHE SHUT HER EYES
lbi-1701-141759-0016 SHE FELT THAT SONYA WAS SPEAKING THE TRUTH THAT THERE WAS SUCH LOVE AS SONYA WAS SPEAKING OF
lbi-1701-141759-0017 SHE BELIEVED IT COULD BE BUT DID NOT UNDERSTAND IT
lbi-1701-141759-0018 SHALL YOU WRITE TO HIM SHE ASKED
lbi-1701-141759-0019 NOW THAT HE WAS ALREADY AN OFFICER AND A WOUNDED HERO WOULD IT BE RIGHT TO REMIND HIM OF HERSELF AND AS IT MIGHT SEEM OF THE OBLIGATIONS TO HER HE HAD TAKEN ON HIMSELF
lbi-1701-141759-0020 I DON'T KNOW
lbi-1701-141759-0021 SONYA SMILED NO
lbi-1701-141759-0022 IT'S BECAUSE SHE WAS IN LOVE WITH THAT FAT ONE IN SPECTACLES THAT WAS HOW PETYA DESCRIBED HIS NAMESAKE THE NEW COUNT BEZUKHOV AND NOW SHE'S IN LOVE WITH THAT SINGER HE MEANT NATASHA'S ITALIAN SINGING MASTER THAT'S WHY SHE'S ASHAMED
lbi-1701-141759-0023 PETYA YOU'RE A STUPID SAID NATASHA
lbi-1701-141759-0024 THE COUNTESS HAD BEEN PREPARED BY ANNA MIKHAYLOVNA'S HINTS AT DINNER
lbi-1701-141759-0025 ON RETIRING TO HER OWN ROOM SHE SAT IN AN ARMCHAIR HER EYES FIXED ON A MINIATURE PORTRAIT OF HER SON ON THE LID OF A SNUFFBOX WHILE THE TEARS KEPT COMING INTO HER EYES
lbi-1701-141759-0026 THE COUNT PUT HIS EAR TO THE KEYHOLE AND LISTENED
lbi-1701-141759-0027 AT FIRST HE HEARD THE SOUND OF INDIFFERENT VOICES THEN ANNA MIKHAYLOVNA'S VOICE ALONE IN A LONG SPEECH THEN A CRY THEN SILENCE THEN BOTH VOICES TOGETHER WITH GLAD INTONATIONS AND THEN FOOTSTEPS
lbi-1701-141759-0028 ANNA MIKHAYLOVNA OPENED THE DOOR
lbi-1701-141759-0029 WHEN SHE HEARD THIS SONYA BLUSHED SO THAT TEARS CAME INTO HER EYES AND UNABLE TO BEAR THE LOOKS TURNED UPON HER RAN AWAY INTO THE DANCING HALL WHIRLED ROUND IT AT FULL SPEED WITH HER DRESS PUFFED OUT LIKE A BALLOON AND FLUSHED AND SMILING PLUMPED DOWN ON THE FLOOR
lbi-1701-141759-0030 THE COUNTESS WAS CRYING
lbi-1701-141759-0031 FROM ALL HE SAYS ONE SHOULD BE GLAD AND NOT CRY
lbi-1701-141759-0032 HOW CHARMINGLY HE DESCRIBES SAID SHE READING THE DESCRIPTIVE PART OF THE LETTER AND WHAT A SOUL
lbi-1701-141759-0033 I ALWAYS SAID WHEN HE WAS ONLY SO HIGH I ALWAYS SAID
lbi-1701-141760-0000 THE PAVLOGRADS HELD FEAST AFTER FEAST CELEBRATING AWARDS THEY HAD RECEIVED FOR THE CAMPAIGN AND MADE EXPEDITIONS TO OLMUTZ TO VISIT A CERTAIN CAROLINE THE HUNGARIAN WHO HAD RECENTLY OPENED A RESTAURANT THERE WITH GIRLS AS WAITRESSES
lbi-1701-141760-0001 THE GUARDS HAD MADE THEIR WHOLE MARCH AS IF ON A PLEASURE TRIP PARADING THEIR CLEANLINESS AND DISCIPLINE
lbi-1701-141760-0002 THE REGIMENTS HAD ENTERED AND LEFT THE TOWN WITH THEIR BANDS PLAYING AND BY THE GRAND DUKE'S ORDERS THE MEN HAD MARCHED ALL THE WAY IN STEP A PRACTICE ON WHICH THE GUARDS PRIDED THEMSELVES THE OFFICERS ON FOOT AND AT THEIR PROPER POSTS
lbi-1701-141760-0003 BORIS HAD BEEN QUARTERED AND HAD MARCHED ALL THE WAY WITH BERG WHO WAS ALREADY IN COMMAND OF A COMPANY
lbi-1701-141760-0004 BORIS DURING THE CAMPAIGN HAD MADE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF MANY PERSONS WHO MIGHT PROVE USEFUL TO HIM AND BY A LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION HE HAD BROUGHT FROM PIERRE HAD BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH PRINCE ANDREW BOLKONSKI THROUGH WHOM HE HOPED TO OBTAIN A POST ON THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF'S STAFF
lbi-1701-141760-0005 BERG AND BORIS HAVING RESTED AFTER YESTERDAY'S MARCH WERE SITTING CLEAN AND NEATLY DRESSED AT A ROUND TABLE IN THE CLEAN QUARTERS ALLOTTED TO THEM PLAYING CHESS
lbi-1701-141760-0006 WELL HOW ARE YOU GOING TO GET OUT OF THAT HE REMARKED
lbi-1701-141760-0007 AT THAT MOMENT THE DOOR OPENED
lbi-1701-141760-0008 DEAR ME HOW YOU HAVE CHANGED
lbi-1701-141760-0009 HE WAS ABOUT TO EMBRACE HIS FRIEND BUT NICHOLAS AVOIDED HIM
lbi-1701-141760-0010 HE WANTED TO PINCH HIM PUSH HIM DO ANYTHING BUT KISS HIM A THING EVERYBODY DID
lbi-1701-141760-0011 BUT NOTWITHSTANDING THIS BORIS EMBRACED HIM IN A QUIET FRIENDLY WAY AND KISSED HIM THREE TIMES
lbi-1701-141760-0012 THEY HAD NOT MET FOR NEARLY HALF A YEAR AND BEING AT THE AGE WHEN YOUNG MEN TAKE THEIR FIRST STEPS ON LIFE'S ROAD EACH SAW IMMENSE CHANGES IN THE OTHER QUITE A NEW REFLECTION OF THE SOCIETY IN WHICH THEY HAD TAKEN THOSE FIRST STEPS
lbi-1701-141760-0013 I DID NOT EXPECT YOU TODAY HE ADDED
lbi-1701-141760-0014 YOU KNOW OF COURSE THAT HIS IMPERIAL HIGHNESS RODE WITH OUR REGIMENT ALL THE TIME SO THAT WE HAD EVERY COMFORT AND EVERY ADVANTAGE
lbi-1701-141760-0015 WHAT RECEPTIONS WE HAD IN POLAND
lbi-1701-141760-0016 WHAT DINNERS AND BALLS I CAN'T TELL YOU
lbi-1701-141760-0017 OH YOU GUARDS SAID ROSTOV I SAY SEND FOR SOME WINE
lbi-1701-141760-0018 HE WENT TO HIS BED DREW A PURSE FROM UNDER THE CLEAN PILLOW AND SENT FOR WINE
lbi-1701-141760-0019 YES AND I HAVE SOME MONEY AND A LETTER TO GIVE YOU HE ADDED
lbi-1701-141760-0020 OH DON'T MENTION IT COUNT I QUITE UNDERSTAND SAID BERG GETTING UP AND SPEAKING IN A MUFFLED AND GUTTURAL VOICE
lbi-1701-141760-0021 GO ACROSS TO OUR HOSTS THEY INVITED YOU ADDED BORIS
lbi-1701-141760-0022 BERG PUT ON THE CLEANEST OF COATS WITHOUT A SPOT OR SPECK OF DUST STOOD BEFORE A LOOKING GLASS AND BRUSHED THE HAIR ON HIS TEMPLES UPWARDS IN THE WAY AFFECTED BY THE EMPEROR ALEXANDER AND HAVING ASSURED HIMSELF FROM THE WAY ROSTOV LOOKED AT IT THAT HIS COAT HAD BEEN NOTICED LEFT THE ROOM WITH A PLEASANT SMILE
lbi-1701-141760-0023 OH DEAR WHAT A BEAST I AM MUTTERED ROSTOV AS HE READ THE LETTER WHY
lbi-1701-141760-0024 WELL HAVE YOU SENT GABRIEL FOR SOME WINE ALL RIGHT LET'S HAVE SOME
lbi-1701-141760-0025 IN THE LETTER FROM HIS PARENTS WAS ENCLOSED A LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION TO BAGRATION WHICH THE OLD COUNTESS AT ANNA MIKHAYLOVNA'S ADVICE HAD OBTAINED THROUGH AN ACQUAINTANCE AND SENT TO HER SON ASKING HIM TO TAKE IT TO ITS DESTINATION AND MAKE USE OF IT
lbi-1701-141760-0026 WHY HAVE YOU THROWN THAT AWAY ASKED BORIS
lbi-1701-141760-0027 IT IS SOME LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION WHAT THE DEVIL DO I WANT IT FOR
lbi-1701-141760-0028 HE LOOKED INTENTLY AND INQUIRINGLY INTO HIS FRIEND'S EYES EVIDENTLY TRYING IN VAIN TO FIND THE ANSWER TO SOME QUESTION
lbi-1701-141760-0029 WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT COUNT I WAS NOT AT ALL ALARMED BECAUSE I KNEW I WAS RIGHT
lbi-1701-141760-0030 I CAME FORWARD BERG STOOD UP AND SHOWED HOW HE PRESENTED HIMSELF WITH HIS HAND TO HIS CAP AND REALLY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT FOR A FACE TO EXPRESS GREATER RESPECT AND SELF COMPLACENCY THAN HIS DID
lbi-1701-141760-0031 WELL HE STORMED AT ME AS THE SAYING IS STORMED AND STORMED AND STORMED
lbi-1701-141760-0032 IT WAS NOT A MATTER OF LIFE BUT RATHER OF DEATH AS THE SAYING IS
lbi-1701-141760-0033 ALBANIANS AND DEVILS AND TO SIBERIA SAID BERG WITH A SAGACIOUS SMILE
lbi-1701-141760-0034 STILL I REMAINED SILENT AND WHAT DO YOU THINK COUNT
lbi-1701-141760-0035 THE NEXT DAY IT WAS NOT EVEN MENTIONED IN THE ORDERS OF THE DAY
lbi-1701-141760-0036 THAT'S THE WAY COUNT SAID BERG LIGHTING HIS PIPE AND EMITTING RINGS OF SMOKE
lbi-1701-141760-0037 YES THAT WAS FINE SAID ROSTOV SMILING
lbi-1701-141760-0038 ROSTOV WAS A TRUTHFUL YOUNG MAN AND WOULD ON NO ACCOUNT HAVE TOLD A DELIBERATE LIE
lbi-1701-141760-0039 HE BEGAN HIS STORY MEANING TO TELL EVERYTHING JUST AS IT HAPPENED BUT IMPERCEPTIBLY INVOLUNTARILY AND INEVITABLY HE LAPSED INTO FALSEHOOD
lbi-1701-141760-0040 PRINCE ANDREW WHO LIKED TO HELP YOUNG MEN WAS FLATTERED BY BEING ASKED FOR HIS ASSISTANCE AND BEING WELL DISPOSED TOWARD BORIS WHO HAD MANAGED TO PLEASE HIM THE DAY BEFORE HE WISHED TO DO WHAT THE YOUNG MAN WANTED
lbi-1701-141760-0041 IN SPITE OF PRINCE ANDREW'S DISAGREEABLE IRONICAL TONE IN SPITE OF THE CONTEMPT WITH WHICH ROSTOV FROM HIS FIGHTING ARMY POINT OF VIEW REGARDED ALL THESE LITTLE ADJUTANTS ON THE STAFF OF WHOM THE NEWCOMER WAS EVIDENTLY ONE ROSTOV FELT CONFUSED BLUSHED AND BECAME SILENT
lbi-1701-141760-0042 BORIS INQUIRED WHAT NEWS THERE MIGHT BE ON THE STAFF AND WHAT WITHOUT INDISCRETION ONE MIGHT ASK ABOUT OUR PLANS
lbi-1701-141760-0043 WE SHALL PROBABLY ADVANCE REPLIED BOLKONSKI EVIDENTLY RELUCTANT TO SAY MORE IN THE PRESENCE OF A STRANGER
lbi-1701-141760-0044 BERG TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO ASK WITH GREAT POLITENESS WHETHER AS WAS RUMORED THE ALLOWANCE OF FORAGE MONEY TO CAPTAINS OF COMPANIES WOULD BE DOUBLED
lbi-1701-141760-0045 I WAS THERE SAID ROSTOV ANGRILY AS IF INTENDING TO INSULT THE AIDE DE CAMP
lbi-1701-141760-0046 WITH A SLIGHTLY CONTEMPTUOUS SMILE HE SAID YES THERE ARE MANY STORIES NOW TOLD ABOUT THAT AFFAIR
lbi-1701-141760-0047 BUT OUR STORIES ARE THE STORIES OF MEN WHO HAVE BEEN UNDER THE ENEMY'S FIRE
lbi-1701-141760-0048 OUR STORIES HAVE SOME WEIGHT NOT LIKE THE STORIES OF THOSE FELLOWS ON THE STAFF WHO GET REWARDS WITHOUT DOING ANYTHING
lbi-1701-141760-0049 HOWEVER HE ADDED RISING YOU KNOW MY NAME AND WHERE TO FIND ME BUT DON'T FORGET THAT I DO NOT REGARD EITHER MYSELF OR YOU AS HAVING BEEN AT ALL INSULTED AND AS A MAN OLDER THAN YOU MY ADVICE IS TO LET THE MATTER DROP
lbi-1701-141760-0050 EXCLAIMED PRINCE ANDREW AND WITH A BOW TO THEM BOTH HE WENT OUT
lbi-1701-141760-0051 AND HE WAS STILL MORE ANGRY AT HAVING OMITTED TO SAY IT
lbi-1701-141760-0052 HE ORDERED HIS HORSE AT ONCE AND COLDLY TAKING LEAVE OF BORIS RODE HOME
lbi-1701-141760-0053 SHOULD HE GO TO HEADQUARTERS NEXT DAY AND CHALLENGE THAT AFFECTED ADJUTANT OR REALLY LET THE MATTER DROP WAS THE QUESTION THAT WORRIED HIM ALL THE WAY
lbi-2506-11267-0000 I SEE SHOALS OF THEM DEPART NOT PERHAPS WITHOUT AN INNATE LONGING TOO TO QUIT THE ISLAND ALONG WITH THOSE HAPPY SNOBS
lbi-2506-11267-0001 FAREWELL DEAR FRIENDS I SAY YOU LITTLE KNOW THAT THE INDIVIDUAL WHO REGARDS YOU FROM THE BEACH IS YOUR FRIEND AND HISTORIOGRAPHER AND BROTHER
lbi-2506-11267-0002 I WENT TO DAY TO SEE OUR EXCELLENT FRIEND SNOOKS ON BOARD THE QUEEN OF THE FRENCH MANY SCORES OF SNOBS WERE THERE ON THE DECK OF THAT FINE SHIP MARCHING FORTH IN THEIR PRIDE AND BRAVERY
lbi-2506-11267-0003 THEY WILL BE AT OSTEND IN FOUR HOURS THEY WILL INUNDATE THE CONTINENT NEXT WEEK THEY WILL CARRY INTO FAR LANDS THE FAMOUS IMAGE OF THE BRITISH SNOB
lbi-2506-11267-0004 I HAVE SEEN SNOBS IN PINK COATS AND HUNTING BOOTS SCOURING OVER THE CAMPAGNA OF ROME AND HAVE HEARD THEIR OATHS AND THEIR WELL KNOWN SLANG IN THE GALLERIES OF THE VATICAN AND UNDER THE SHADOWY ARCHES OF THE COLOSSEUM
lbi-2506-11267-0005 MY LADY MARCHIONESS COMES ON BOARD LOOKS ROUND WITH THAT HAPPY AIR OF MINGLED TERROR AND IMPERTINENCE WHICH DISTINGUISHES HER LADYSHIP AND RUSHES TO HER CARRIAGE FOR IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT SHE SHOULD MINGLE WITH THE OTHER SNOBS ON DECK
lbi-2506-11267-0006 THERE SHE SITS AND WILL BE ILL IN PRIVATE
lbi-2506-11267-0007 THE STRAWBERRY LEAVES ON HER CHARIOT PANELS ARE ENGRAVED ON HER LADYSHIP'S HEART
lbi-2506-11267-0008 AND DAVIS YOU'D BEST TAKE THE PISTOL CASE INTO THE CABIN
lbi-2506-11267-0009 LOOK AT HONEST NATHAN HOUNDSDITCH AND HIS LADY AND THEIR LITTLE SON
lbi-2506-11267-0010 WHAT A NOBLE AIR OF BLAZING CONTENTMENT ILLUMINATES THE FEATURES OF THOSE SNOBS OF EASTERN RACE
lbi-2506-11267-0011 WHAT A TOILETTE HOUNDSDITCH'S IS
lbi-2506-11267-0012 HE WILL NEVER SPARE HIMSELF ANY CHEAP ENJOYMENT
lbi-2506-11267-0013 I HAVE SAID BEFORE I LIKE TO LOOK AT THE PEOPLES ON THEIR GALA DAYS THEY ARE SO PICTURESQUELY AND OUTRAGEOUSLY SPLENDID AND HAPPY
lbi-2506-11267-0014 YONDER COMES CAPTAIN BULL SPICK AND SPAN TIGHT AND TRIM WHO TRAVELS FOR FOUR OR SIX MONTHS EVERY YEAR OF HIS LIFE WHO DOES NOT COMMIT HIMSELF BY LUXURY OF RAIMENT OR INSOLENCE OF DEMEANOUR BUT I THINK IS AS GREAT A SNOB AS ANY MAN ON BOARD
lbi-2506-11267-0015 BULL PASSES THE SEASON IN LONDON SPONGING FOR DINNERS AND SLEEPING IN A GARRET NEAR HIS CLUB
lbi-2506-11267-0016 SEE HE IS UP TO OLD CARABAS ALREADY I TOLD YOU HE WOULD
lbi-2506-11267-0017 THAT BROAD SHOULDERED BUCK WITH THE GREAT WHISKERS AND THE CLEANED WHITE KID GLOVES IS MISTER PHELIM CLANCY OF POLDOODYSTOWN HE CALLS HIMSELF MISTER DE CLANCY HE ENDEAVOURS TO DISGUISE HIS NATIVE BROGUE WITH THE RICHEST SUPERPOSITION OF ENGLISH AND IF YOU PLAY AT BILLIARDS OR ECARTE WITH HIM THE CHANCES ARE THAT YOU WILL WIN THE FIRST GAME AND HE THE SEVEN OR EIGHT GAMES ENSUING
lbi-2506-11267-0018 THE NEXT PERSON IS BUT HARK
lbi-2506-11278-0000 WHEN A GROSS INSTANCE OF SNOBBISHNESS HAPPENS WHY SHOULD NOT THE INDIGNANT JOURNALIST CALL THE PUBLIC ATTENTION TO THAT DELINQUENCY TOO
lbi-2506-11278-0001 HOW FOR INSTANCE COULD THAT WONDERFUL CASE OF THE EARL OF MANGELWURZEL AND HIS BROTHER BE EXAMINED IN THE SNOBBISH POINT OF VIEW
lbi-2506-11278-0002 ALL WE REQUIRE IS THAT A MAN SHOULD BE RECOMMENDED TO US BY THE EARL OF MANGELWURZELSHIRE
lbi-2506-11278-0003 O YOU PRIDE OF ALL SNOBLAND
lbi-2506-11278-0004 O YOU CRAWLING TRUCKLING SELF CONFESSED LACKEYS AND PARASITES
lbi-2506-11278-0005 IT WAS HER SNOBBISH SENTIMENT THAT MISLED HER AND MADE HER VANITIES A PREY TO THE SWINDLING FORTUNE TELLER
lbi-2506-11278-0006 HOW WOULD YOU ACCOUNT FOR THE PRODIGIOUS BENEVOLENCE EXERCISED TOWARDS THE INTERESTING YOUNG FRENCH LADY
lbi-2506-11278-0007 THE HONEST BOARDING HOUSE PEOPLE WERE AT HER FEET AT ONCE
lbi-2506-11278-0008 GOOD HONEST SIMPLE LORD LOVING CHILDREN OF SNOBLAND
lbi-2506-11278-0009 FINALLY THERE WAS THE CASE OF THE RIGHT HONOURABLE MISTER VERNON AT YORK
lbi-2506-11278-0010 THE RIGHT HONOURABLE WAS THE SON OF A NOBLEMAN AND PRACTISED ON AN OLD LADY
lbi-2506-11278-0011 THEN HE CAST HIS NETS OVER A FAMILY OF FATHER MOTHER AND DAUGHTERS ONE OF WHOM HE PROPOSED TO MARRY
lbi-2506-11278-0012 ONE DAY THE TRAITOR FLED WITH A TEAPOT AND A BASKETFUL OF COLD VICTUALS
lbi-2506-11278-0013 IT WAS THE RIGHT HONOURABLE WHICH BAITED THE HOOK WHICH GORGED ALL THESE GREEDY SIMPLE SNOBS
lbi-2506-11278-0014 WOULD THEY HAVE BEEN TAKEN IN BY A COMMONER
lbi-2506-11278-0015 ALAS AND ALAS WHAT MORTAL MAN THAT SPEAKS THE TRUTH CAN HOPE FOR SUCH A LANDLADY

lbi-2506-169427-0001 AS THE READER FOR I HATE YOUR IFS HAS A THOROUGH KNOWLEDGE OF HUMAN NATURE I NEED NOT SAY MORE TO SATISFY HIM THAT MY HERO COULD NOT GO ON AT THIS RATE WITHOUT SOME SLIGHT EXPERIENCE OF THESE INCIDENTAL MEMENTOS
lbi-2506-169427-0002 TO SPEAK THE TRUTH HE HAD WANTONLY INVOLVED HIMSELF IN A MULTITUDE OF SMALL BOOK DEBTS OF THIS STAMP WHICH NOTWITHSTANDING EUGENIUS'S FREQUENT ADVICE HE TOO MUCH DISREGARDED THINKING THAT AS NOT ONE OF THEM WAS CONTRACTED THRO ANY MALIGNANCY BUT ON THE CONTRARY FROM AN HONESTY OF MIND AND A MERE JOCUNDITY OF HUMOUR THEY WOULD ALL OF THEM BE CROSS'D OUT IN COURSE
lbi-2506-169427-0003 EUGENIUS WOULD NEVER ADMIT THIS AND WOULD OFTEN TELL HIM THAT ONE DAY OR OTHER HE WOULD CERTAINLY BE RECKONED WITH AND HE WOULD OFTEN ADD IN AN ACCENT OF SORROWFUL APPREHENSION TO THE UTTERMOST MITE
lbi-2506-169427-0004 WHAT INCLINED EUGENIUS TO THE SAME OPINION WAS AS FOLLOWS
lbi-2506-169427-0005 YORICK FOLLOWED EUGENIUS WITH HIS EYES TO THE DOOR HE THEN CLOSED THEM AND NEVER OPENED THEM MORE
lbi-2506-169427-0006 ALAS POOR YORICK
lbi-3660-172182-0000 NOW THIS IS HOW ARTHUR HUNTED THE STAG
lbi-3660-172182-0001 AND THE LAST DOG THAT WAS LET LOOSE WAS THE FAVORITE DOG OF ARTHUR CAVALL WAS HIS NAME
lbi-3660-172182-0002 THEN THEY SOUNDED THE DEATH HORN FOR SLAYING AND THEY ALL GATHERED ROUND
lbi-3660-172182-0003 ONE WISHED THAT IT SHOULD BE GIVEN TO THE LADY BEST BELOVED BY HIM AND ANOTHER TO THE LADY WHOM HE LOVED BEST
lbi-3660-172182-0004 AND AFTER MIDDAY THEY BEHELD AN UNSHAPELY LITTLE MAN UPON A HORSE AND AFTER HIM A DAME OR A DAMSEL ALSO ON HORSEBACK AND AFTER HER A KNIGHT OF LARGE STATURE BOWED DOWN AND HANGING HIS HEAD LOW AND SORROWFULLY AND CLAD IN BROKEN AND WORTHLESS ARMOR
lbi-3660-172182-0005 I KNOW NOT WHO THEY ARE SAID HE BUT I KNOW SAID GUENEVER THIS IS THE KNIGHT WHOM GERAINT PURSUED AND METHINKS THAT HE COMES NOT HERE BY HIS OWN FREE WILL
lbi-3660-172182-0006 BUT GERAINT HAS OVERTAKEN HIM AND AVENGED THE INSULT TO THE MAIDEN TO THE UTTERMOST
lbi-3660-172182-0007 LADY SAID HE AT THE GATE THERE IS A KNIGHT AND I SAW NEVER A MAN OF SO PITIFUL AN ASPECT TO LOOK UPON AS HE
lbi-3660-172182-0008 I DO SAID HE HE TELLS ME THAT HE IS EDEYRN THE SON OF NUDD
lbi-3660-172182-0009 THEN SHE REPLIED I KNOW HIM NOT
lbi-3660-172182-0010 SO GUENEVER WENT TO THE GATE TO MEET HIM AND HE ENTERED
lbi-3660-172182-0011 AND GERAINT GREETS THEE WELL AND IN GREETING THEE HE COMPELLED ME TO COME HITHER TO DO THY PLEASURE FOR THE INSULT WHICH THY MAIDEN RECEIVED FROM THE DWARF NOW WHERE DID HE OVERTAKE THEE
lbi-3660-172182-0012 SIR SAID SHE WHEN THINKEST THOU THAT GERAINT WILL BE HERE
lbi-3660-172182-0013 TO MORROW LADY I THINK HE WILL BE HERE WITH THE MAIDEN
lbi-3660-172182-0014 I AM LORD SAID HE AND I HAVE MET WITH MUCH TROUBLE AND RECEIVED WOUNDS UNSUPPORTABLE
lbi-3660-172182-0015 WELL SAID ARTHUR FROM WHAT I HEAR IT BEHOOVES GUENEVER TO BE MERCIFUL TOWARDS THEE
lbi-3660-172182-0016 THE MERCY WHICH THOU DESIREST LORD SAID SHE WILL I GRANT TO HIM SINCE IT IS AS INSULTING TO THEE THAT AN INSULT SHOULD BE OFFERED TO ME AS TO THYSELF
lbi-3660-172182-0017 THUS WILL IT BE BEST TO DO SAID ARTHUR LET THIS MAN HAVE MEDICAL CARE UNTIL IT BE KNOWN WHETHER HE MAY LIVE
lbi-3660-172182-0018 TO GUENEVER AND HER HANDMAIDENS SAID HE
lbi-3660-172182-0019 AND THE STEWARD OF THE HOUSEHOLD SO ORDERED HER
lbi-3660-172182-0020 AND BEING YOUNG HE CHANGED HIMSELF AND GREW TO HATE THE SIN THAT SEEM'D SO LIKE HIS OWN OF MODRED ARTHUR'S NEPHEW AND FELL AT LAST IN THE GREAT BATTLE FIGHTING FOR THE KING
lbi-3660-172182-0021 AND WHEN GERAINT CAME TO THE PLACE WHERE GUENEVER WAS HE SALUTED HER
lbi-3660-172182-0022 THEN THEY WENT IN AND DISMOUNTED
lbi-3660-172182-0023 HEAVEN PROTECT THEE SAID ARTHUR AND THE WELCOME OF HEAVEN BE UNTO THEE
lbi-3660-172182-0024 AND INASMUCH AS THOU HAST VANQUISHED EDEYRN THE SON OF NUDD THOU HAST HAD A PROSPEROUS CAREER
lbi-3660-172182-0025 AND FROM THAT TIME SHE BECAME HIS WIFE
lbi-3660-172182-0026 AND THE MAIDEN TOOK UP HER ABODE IN THE PALACE AND SHE HAD MANY COMPANIONS BOTH MEN AND WOMEN AND THERE WAS NO MAIDEN MORE ESTEEMED THAN SHE IN THE ISLAND OF BRITAIN
lbi-3660-172182-0027 AND A YEAR AND A SECOND AND A THIRD HE PROCEEDED THUS UNTIL HIS FAME HAD FLOWN OVER THE FACE OF THE KINGDOM
lbi-3660-172182-0028 AND HE GREETS THEE WELL AS AN UNCLE SHOULD GREET HIS NEPHEW AND AS A VASSAL SHOULD GREET HIS LORD
lbi-3660-172182-0029 AND THE NEIGHBORING CHIEFS KNOWING THIS GROW INSOLENT TOWARDS HIM AND COVET HIS LAND AND POSSESSIONS
lbi-3660-172182-0030 AND ARTHUR TOLD GERAINT THE CAUSE OF THE MISSION AND OF THE COMING OF THE AMBASSADORS TO HIM OUT OF CORNWALL TRULY SAID GERAINT BE IT TO MY ADVANTAGE OR DISADVANTAGE LORD I WILL DO ACCORDING TO THY WILL CONCERNING THIS EMBASSY
lbi-3660-172182-0031 WHAT DISCOURSE SAID GUENEVER DO I HEAR BETWEEN YOU
lbi-3660-172182-0032 SAID GERAINT I THINK I SHALL HAVE ENOUGH OF KNIGHTHOOD WITH ME AND THEY SET FORTH
lbi-3660-172182-0033 AND NEVER WAS THERE SEEN A FAIRER HOST JOURNEYING TOWARDS THE SEVERN
lbi-3660-172182-0034 AND HE SAID TO GERAINT I AM A FEEBLE AND AN AGED MAN AND WHILST I WAS ABLE TO MAINTAIN THE DOMINION FOR THEE AND FOR MYSELF I DID SO
lbi-3660-172182-0035 AND EVERY ONE ASKED THAT WHICH HE DESIRED
lbi-3660-172182-0036 AND THEY WERE NOT LONG IN GIVING SO EAGER WAS EVERY ONE TO BESTOW GIFTS AND OF THOSE WHO CAME TO ASK GIFTS NONE DEPARTED UNSATISFIED
lbi-3660-172182-0037 THEN GERAINT SENT AMBASSADORS TO THE MEN OF CORNWALL TO ASK THEM THIS
lbi-3660-172182-0038 AND THEY ALL SAID THAT IT WOULD BE THE FULNESS OF JOY AND HONOR TO THEM FOR GERAINT TO COME AND RECEIVE THEIR HOMAGE
lbi-3660-172182-0039 SO HE RECEIVED THE HOMAGE OF SUCH AS WERE THERE
lbi-3660-172182-0040 AND THE DAY AFTER THE FOLLOWERS OF ARTHUR INTENDED TO GO AWAY
lbi-3660-172183-0000 GERAINT AS HE HAD BEEN USED TO DO WHEN HE WAS AT ARTHUR'S COURT FREQUENTED TOURNAMENTS
lbi-3660-172183-0001 BEFORE GERAINT THE SCOURGE OF THE ENEMY I SAW STEEDS WHITE WITH FOAM AND AFTER THE SHOUT OF BATTLE A FEARFUL TORRENT
lbi-3660-172183-0002 THESE TIDINGS CAME TO ERBIN
lbi-3660-172183-0003 NOT I BY MY CONFESSION UNTO HEAVEN SAID SHE THERE IS NOTHING MORE HATEFUL UNTO ME THAN THIS
lbi-3660-172183-0004 AND THE TEARS SHE SHED AND THE WORDS SHE HAD SPOKEN AWOKE HIM
lbi-3660-172183-0005 AND EVIL BETIDE ME SAID HE IF THOU RETURNEST HERE UNTIL THOU KNOWEST WHETHER I HAVE LOST MY STRENGTH SO COMPLETELY AS THOU DIDST SAY
lbi-3660-172183-0006 THEN GERAINT WENT TO SEE ERBIN
lbi-3660-172183-0007 SIR SAID HE I AM GOING UPON A QUEST AND I AM NOT CERTAIN WHEN I MAY COME BACK
lbi-3660-172183-0008 TAKE HEED THEREFORE UNTO THY POSSESSIONS UNTIL MY RETURN
lbi-3660-172183-0009 BUT ONE PERSON ONLY WILL GO WITH ME
lbi-3660-172183-0010 AND HE DESIRED ENID TO MOUNT HER HORSE AND TO RIDE FORWARD AND TO KEEP A LONG WAY BEFORE HIM
lbi-3660-172183-0011 AND UNLESS I SPEAK UNTO THEE SAY NOT THOU ONE WORD EITHER
lbi-3660-172183-0012 AND THOUGH THOU SHOULDST DESIRE TO SEE MY DEFEAT AND MY DEATH BY THE HANDS OF THOSE MEN YET DO I FEEL NO DREAD
lbi-3660-172183-0013 AND HE RECEIVED HIM AND THAT NOT FEEBLY
lbi-3660-172183-0014 AND SAY NOT ONE WORD UNTO ME UNLESS I SPEAK FIRST UNTO THEE
lbi-3660-172183-0015 I WILL DO AS FAR AS I CAN LORD SAID SHE ACCORDING TO THY DESIRE
lbi-3660-172183-0016 AH MAIDEN SAID HE IT IS VAIN TO ATTEMPT PROCEEDING FORWARD
lbi-3660-172183-0017 I CANNOT BY ANY MEANS REFRAIN FROM SLEEP THROUGH WEARINESS SAID HE DO THOU THEREFORE WATCH THE HORSES AND SLEEP NOT
lbi-3660-172183-0018 AND WHEN SHE SAW THE DAWN OF DAY APPEAR SHE LOOKED AROUND HER TO SEE IF HE WERE WAKING AND THEREUPON HE WOKE
lbi-3660-172183-0019 AND THEY LEFT THE WOOD AND THEY CAME TO AN OPEN COUNTRY WITH MEADOWS ON ONE HAND AND MOWERS MOWING THE MEADOWS
lbi-3660-172183-0020 MY LORD HE ADDED WILL IT BE DISPLEASING TO THEE IF I ASK WHENCE THOU COMEST ALSO
lbi-3660-172183-0021 WILT THOU FOLLOW MY COUNSEL SAID THE YOUTH AND TAKE THY MEAL FROM ME
lbi-3660-172183-0022 WHAT SORT OF MEAL HE INQUIRED
lbi-3660-172183-0023 THEN THEY WASHED AND TOOK THEIR REPAST
lbi-3660-172183-0024 I GO NOW LORD SAID HE TO MEET THE KNIGHT AND TO CONDUCT HIM TO HIS LODGING
lbi-3660-172183-0025 I WILL DO LORD SAID SHE AS THOU SAYEST
lbi-3660-172183-0026 AND AFTER THEY HAD EATEN AND DRANK GERAINT WENT TO SLEEP AND SO DID ENID ALSO
lbi-3660-6517-0000 THE DATES SEEM UNIMPORTANT BUT THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD THE OFFICERS AND MEN OF THE SHIP HAVE BEEN UNREMITTINGLY BUSY
lbi-3660-6517-0001 BOWERS ATTACKED THE SHIP'S STORES SURVEYED RELISTED AND RESTOWED THEM SAVING VERY MUCH SPACE BY UNSTOWING NUMEROUS CASES AND STOWING THE CONTENTS IN THE LAZARETTE
lbi-3660-6517-0002 WITHOUT STEAM THE LEAK CAN NOW BE KEPT UNDER WITH THE HAND PUMP BY TWO DAILY EFFORTS OF A QUARTER OF AN HOUR TO TWENTY MINUTES
lbi-3660-6517-0003 AS THE SHIP WAS AND IN HER PRESENT HEAVILY LADEN CONDITION IT WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE TAKEN THREE TO FOUR HOURS EACH DAY
lbi-3660-6517-0004 THE LARGE GREEN TENT WAS PUT UP AND PROPER SUPPORTS MADE FOR IT
lbi-3660-6517-0005 THE ENGINE ROOM STAFF AND ANDERSON'S PEOPLE ON THE ENGINES SCIENTISTS WERE STOWING THEIR LABORATORIES THE COOK REFITTING HIS GALLEY AND SO FORTH NOT A SINGLE SPOT BUT HAD ITS BAND OF WORKERS
lbi-3660-6517-0006 THE MEN'S SPACE SUCH AS IT IS THEREFORE EXTENDS FROM THE FORE HATCH TO THE STEM ON THE MAIN DECK
lbi-3660-6517-0007 UNDER THE FORECASTLE ARE STALLS FOR FIFTEEN PONIES THE MAXIMUM THE SPACE WOULD HOLD THE NARROW IRREGULAR SPACE IN FRONT IS PACKED TIGHT WITH FODDER
lbi-3660-6517-0008 IMMEDIATELY BEHIND THE FORECASTLE BULKHEAD IS THE SMALL BOOBY HATCH THE ONLY ENTRANCE TO THE MEN'S MESS DECK IN BAD WEATHER
lbi-3660-6517-0009 ABAFT THE FORE HATCH IS THE ICE HOUSE
lbi-3660-6517-0010 WE MANAGED TO GET THREE TONS OF ICE ONE HUNDRED SIXTY TWO CARCASES OF MUTTON AND THREE CARCASES OF BEEF BESIDES SOME BOXES OF SWEETBREADS AND KIDNEYS INTO THIS SPACE
lbi-3660-6517-0011 THE SACKS CONTAINING THIS LAST ADDED TO THE GOODS ALREADY MENTIONED MAKE A REALLY HEAVY DECK CARGO AND ONE IS NATURALLY ANXIOUS CONCERNING IT BUT EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE DONE BY LASHING AND SECURING HAS BEEN DONE
lbi-3660-6517-0012 FORAGE I ORIGINALLY ORDERED THIRTY TONS OF COMPRESSED OATEN HAY FROM MELBOURNE
lbi-3660-6517-0013 THE SCENE IS WHOLLY ENCHANTING AND SUCH A VIEW FROM SOME SHELTERED SUNNY CORNER IN A GARDEN WHICH BLAZES WITH MASSES OF RED AND GOLDEN FLOWERS TENDS TO FEELINGS OF INEXPRESSIBLE SATISFACTION WITH ALL THINGS
lbi-3660-6517-0014 A GREAT MASS OF PEOPLE ASSEMBLED
lbi-3660-6517-0015 K AND I LUNCHED WITH A PARTY IN THE NEW ZEALAND COMPANY'S SHIP RUAPEHU
lbi-3660-6517-0016 TELEGRAM TO SAY TERRA NOVA HAD ARRIVED SUNDAY NIGHT
lbi-3660-6517-0017 A THIRD SLEDGE STANDS ACROSS THE BREAK OF THE POOP IN THE SPACE HITHERTO OCCUPIED BY THE AFTER WINCH
lbi-3660-6517-0018 THE QUANTITY IS TWO AND A HALF TONS AND THE SPACE OCCUPIED CONSIDERABLE
lbi-3660-6517-0019 THE SHIP WAS OVER TWO FEET BY THE STERN BUT THIS WILL SOON BE REMEDIED
lbi-3660-6517-0020 THEY MUST PERFORCE BE CHAINED UP AND THEY ARE GIVEN WHAT SHELTER IS AFFORDED ON DECK BUT THEIR POSITION IS NOT ENVIABLE
lbi-3660-6517-0021 IT IS A PATHETIC ATTITUDE DEEPLY SIGNIFICANT OF COLD AND MISERY OCCASIONALLY SOME POOR BEAST EMITS A LONG PATHETIC WHINE
lbi-3660-6517-0022 THERE ARE GENERALLY ONE OR TWO ON WATCH WHICH EASES MATTERS BUT IT IS A SQUASH
lbi-3660-6517-0023 LATER IN THE DAY THE WIND HAS VEERED TO THE WESTWARD HEADING US SLIGHTLY
lbi-3660-6517-0024 OATES AND ATKINSON WITH INTERMITTENT ASSISTANCE FROM OTHERS WERE BUSY KEEPING THE PONIES ON THEIR LEGS
lbi-3660-6517-0025 THERE WAS NOTHING FOR IT BUT TO GRAPPLE WITH THE EVIL AND NEARLY ALL HANDS WERE LABOURING FOR HOURS IN THE WAIST OF THE SHIP HEAVING COAL SACKS OVERBOARD AND RE LASHING THE PETROL CASES ET CETERA IN THE BEST MANNER POSSIBLE UNDER SUCH DIFFICULT AND DANGEROUS CIRCUMSTANCES
lbi-3660-6517-0026 NO SOONER WAS SOME SEMBLANCE OF ORDER RESTORED THAN SOME EXCEPTIONALLY HEAVY WAVE WOULD TEAR AWAY THE LASHING AND THE WORK HAD TO BE DONE ALL OVER AGAIN
lbi-3660-6517-0027 FROM THIS MOMENT ABOUT FOUR A M THE ENGINE ROOM BECAME THE CENTRE OF INTEREST
lbi-3660-6517-0028 THE WATER GAINED IN SPITE OF EVERY EFFORT
lbi-3660-6517-0029 THE OUTLOOK APPEARED GRIM
lbi-3660-6517-0030 THE AMOUNT OF WATER WHICH WAS BEING MADE WITH THE SHIP SO ROUGHLY HANDLED WAS MOST UNCERTAIN
lbi-3660-6517-0031 WILLIAMS HAD TO CONFESS HE WAS BEATEN AND MUST DRAW FIRES WHAT WAS TO BE DONE
lbi-3660-6517-0032 THE BILGE PUMP IS DEPENDENT ON THE MAIN ENGINE
lbi-3660-6517-0033 ON ONE OCCASION I WAS WAIST DEEP WHEN STANDING ON THE RAIL OF THE POOP
lbi-3660-6517-0034 THE AFTERGUARD WERE ORGANISED IN TWO PARTIES BY EVANS TO WORK BUCKETS THE MEN WERE KEPT STEADILY GOING ON THE CHOKED HAND PUMPS THIS SEEMED ALL THAT COULD BE DONE FOR THE MOMENT AND WHAT A MEASURE TO COUNT AS THE SOLE SAFEGUARD OF THE SHIP FROM SINKING PRACTICALLY AN ATTEMPT TO BALE HER OUT
lbi-3660-6517-0035 OCCASIONALLY A HEAVY SEA WOULD BEAR ONE OF THEM AWAY AND HE WAS ONLY SAVED BY HIS CHAIN
lbi-3663-172005-0000 THE FAWN HAD TAKEN HIS MORNING MEAL AND NOW LAY CURLED UP ON A BED OF MOSS
lbi-3663-172005-0001 WHENEVER THE FAWN CAUGHT UP HE WAS QUITE CONTENT TO FRISK ABOUT
lbi-3663-172005-0002 THE DANGER WAS CERTAIN NOW IT WAS NEAR
lbi-3663-172005-0003 THE HOUNDS HAD STRUCK HER TRAIL WHERE SHE TURNED AND THE FAWN WAS SAFE
lbi-3663-172005-0004 ONE WAS ROWING THE OTHER HAD A GUN IN HIS HAND WHAT SHOULD SHE DO
lbi-3663-172005-0005 HER TIRED LEGS COULD NOT PROPEL THE TIRED BODY RAPIDLY
lbi-3663-172005-0006 THE DOE SAW THE BOAT NEARING HER
lbi-3663-172005-0007 IN A MOMENT MORE THE BOAT WAS ON HER AND THE MAN AT THE OARS HAD LEANED OVER AND CAUGHT HER
lbi-3663-172528-0000 I WAS TORMENTED BY THIRST BUT HAD ABSTAINED FROM DRINKING FOR MANY DAYS ACCORDING TO THE DOCTORS ORDERS
lbi-3663-172528-0001 THAT OLD MAN CEASED TO GIVE SO MUCH ANNOYANCE YET SOMETIMES HE APPEARED TO ME IN DREAMS
lbi-3663-172528-0002 FELICE HAD GIVEN THEM ORDERS NOT TO SPEAK TO ME OF THIS
lbi-3663-172528-0003 THIS MAID HAD STOLEN FROM ME CERTAIN LITTLE THINGS OF SOME IMPORTANCE AND IN HER FEAR OF BEING DETECTED SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY GLAD IF I HAD DIED
lbi-3663-172528-0004 ACCORDINGLY SHE ALLOWED ME TWICE TO TAKE AS MUCH AS I COULD OF THE WATER SO THAT IN GOOD EARNEST I SWALLOWED MORE THAN A FLASK FULL ONE I THEN COVERED MYSELF AND BEGAN TO SWEAT AND FELL INTO A DEEP SLEEP
lbi-3663-172528-0005 THEY SAY THAT MY POOR FRIEND WAS ON THE POINT OF FALLING TO THE GROUND SO GRIEVED WAS HE TO HEAR THIS
lbi-3663-172528-0006 AFTERWARDS HE TOOK AN UGLY STICK AND BEGAN TO BEAT THE SERVING GIRL WITH ALL HIS MIGHT SHOUTING OUT AH TRAITRESS YOU HAVE KILLED HIM FOR ME THEN
lbi-3663-172528-0007 SHE MAY INDEED HAVE SAVED MY LIFE SO LEND ME A HELPING HAND FOR I HAVE SWEATED AND BE QUICK ABOUT IT
lbi-3663-172528-0008 FELICE RECOVERED HIS SPIRITS DRIED AND MADE ME COMFORTABLE AND I BEING CONSCIOUS OF A GREAT IMPROVEMENT IN MY STATE BEGAN TO RECKON ON RECOVERY
lbi-3663-172528-0009 JUST THEN THE OTHER DOCTOR BERNARDINO PUT IN HIS APPEARANCE WHO AT THE BEGINNING OF MY ILLNESS HAD REFUSED TO BLEED ME
lbi-3663-172528-0010 MAESTRO FRANCESCO THAT MOST ABLE MAN EXCLAIMED OH POWER OF NATURE
lbi-3663-172528-0011 SHE KNOWS WHAT SHE REQUIRES AND THE PHYSICIANS KNOW NOTHING
lbi-3663-172528-0012 THAT SIMPLETON MAESTRO BERNARDINO MADE ANSWER SAYING IF HE HAD DRUNK ANOTHER BOTTLE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN CURED UPON THE SPOT
lbi-3663-172528-0013 AFTERWARDS HE TURNED TO ME AND ASKED IF I COULD HAVE DRUNK MORE WATER
lbi-3663-172528-0014 I ANSWERED NO BECAUSE I HAD ENTIRELY QUENCHED MY THIRST
lbi-3663-172528-0015 IN LIKE MANNER SHE WAS ASKING FOR WHAT SHE WANTED WHEN THE POOR YOUNG MAN BEGGED YOU TO BLEED HIM
lbi-3663-172528-0016 IF YOU KNEW THAT HIS RECOVERY DEPENDED UPON HIS DRINKING TWO FLASKS OF WATER WHY DID YOU NOT SAY SO BEFORE
lbi-3663-172528-0017 YOU MIGHT THEN HAVE BOASTED OF HIS CURE
lbi-3663-172528-0018 AT THESE WORDS THE WRETCHED QUACK SULKILY DEPARTED AND NEVER SHOWED HIS FACE AGAIN
lbi-3663-172528-0019 THE VERY EVENING I WAS TAKEN WITH GREAT PRECAUTIONS IN A CHAIR WELL WRAPPED UP AND PROTECTED FROM THE COLD
lbi-3663-172528-0020 DO NOT PERMIT HIM ANY IRREGULARITIES FOR THOUGH HE HAS ESCAPED THIS TIME ANOTHER DISORDER NOW WOULD BE THE DEATH OF HIM
lbi-3663-172528-0021 THEN HE TURNED TO ME AND SAID MY BENVENUTO BE PRUDENT COMMIT NO EXCESSES AND WHEN YOU ARE QUITE RECOVERED I BEG YOU TO MAKE ME A MADONNA WITH YOUR OWN HAND AND I WILL ALWAYS PAY MY DEVOTIONS TO IT FOR YOUR SAKE
lbi-3663-172528-0022 SO I MADE MY MIND UP AND PREPARED TO TRAVEL
lbi-3663-172528-0023 THAT DAY MANY FRIENDS CAME TO SEE ME AMONG OTHERS PIER LANDI WHO WAS THE BEST AND DEAREST FRIEND I EVER HAD
lbi-3663-172528-0024 NEXT DAY THERE CAME A CERTAIN NICCOLO DA MONTE AGUTO WHO WAS ALSO A VERY GREAT FRIEND OF MINE
lbi-3663-172528-0025 I HAD HARBOURED HIM IN ROME AND PROVIDED FOR HIS COSTS WHILE HE HAD TURNED MY WHOLE HOUSE UPSIDE DOWN FOR THE MAN WAS SUBJECT TO A SPECIES OF DRY SCAB WHICH HE WAS ALWAYS IN THE HABIT OF SCRATCHING WITH HIS HANDS
lbi-3663-172528-0026 MEANWHILE THAT ABLE PHYSICIAN FRANCESCO DA MONTE VARCHI ATTENDED TO MY CURE WITH GREAT SKILL
lbi-3663-172528-0027 THERE THEY SEATED ME TO WAIT UNTIL THE DUKE WENT BY
lbi-3663-172528-0028 MANY OF MY FRIENDS AT COURT CAME UP TO GREET ME AND EXPRESSED SURPRISE THAT I HAD UNDERGONE THE INCONVENIENCE OF BEING CARRIED IN THAT WAY WHILE SO SHATTERED BY ILLNESS THEY SAID THAT I OUGHT TO HAVE WAITED TILL I WAS WELL AND THEN TO HAVE VISITED THE DUKE
lbi-3663-172528-0029 AT THESE WORDS MAESTRO AGOSTINO THE DUKES TAILOR MADE HIS WAY THROUGH ALL THOSE GENTLEMEN AND SAID IF THAT IS ALL YOU WANT TO KNOW YOU SHALL KNOW IT AT THIS VERY MOMENT
lbi-3663-172528-0030 GIORGIO THE PAINTER WHOM I HAVE MENTIONED HAPPENED JUST THEN TO PASS AND MAESTRO AGOSTINO EXCLAIMED THERE IS THE MAN WHO ACCUSED YOU NOW YOU KNOW YOURSELF IF IT BE TRUE OR NOT
lbi-3663-172528-0031 AS FIERCELY AS I COULD NOT BEING ABLE TO LEAVE MY SEAT I ASKED GIORGIO IF IT WAS TRUE THAT HE HAD ACCUSED ME
lbi-3663-172528-0032 HE DENIED THAT IT WAS SO AND THAT HE HAD EVER SAID ANYTHING OF THE SORT
lbi-3663-172528-0033 MAESTRO AGOSTINO RETORTED YOU GALLOWS BIRD
lbi-3663-172528-0034 DONT YOU KNOW THAT I KNOW IT FOR MOST CERTAIN
lbi-3663-172528-0035 GIORGIO MADE OFF AS QUICKLY AS HE COULD REPEATING THAT HE HAD NOT ACCUSED ME
lbi-3663-172528-0036 THEN AFTER A SHORT WHILE THE DUKE CAME BY WHEREUPON I HAD MYSELF RAISED UP BEFORE HIS EXCELLENCY AND HE HALTED
lbi-3663-172528-0037 THE DUKE GAZED AT ME AND MARVELLED I WAS STILL ALIVE AFTERWARDS HE BADE ME TAKE HEED TO BE AN HONEST MAN AND REGAIN MY HEALTH
lbi-3663-172528-0038 WHEN I REACHED HOME NICCOLO DA MONTE AGUTO CAME TO VISIT ME AND TOLD ME THAT I HAD ESCAPED ONE OF THE MOST DREADFUL PERILS IN THE WORLD QUITE CONTRARY TO ALL HIS EXPECTATIONS FOR HE HAD SEEN MY RUIN WRITTEN WITH INDELIBLE INK NOW I MUST MAKE HASTE TO GET WELL AND AFTERWARDS TAKE FRENCH LEAVE BECAUSE MY JEOPARDY CAME FROM A QUARTER AND A MAN WHO WAS ABLE TO DESTROY ME
lbi-3663-172528-0039 I ANSWERED THAT I HAD DONE NOTHING TO DISPLEASE HIM BUT THAT HE HAD INJURED ME AND TOLD HIM ALL THE AFFAIR ABOUT THE MINT
lbi-3663-172528-0040 HE REPEATED GET HENCE AS QUICKLY AS YOU CAN AND BE OF GOOD COURAGE FOR YOU WILL SEE YOUR VENGEANCE EXECUTED SOONER THAN YOU EXPECT
lbi-3663-172528-0041 I THE BEST ATTENTION TO MY HEALTH GAVE PIETRO PAGOLO ADVICE ABOUT STAMPING THE COINS AND THEN WENT OFF UPON MY WAY TO ROME WITHOUT SAYING A WORD TO THE DUKE OR ANYBODY ELSE
lbi-3663-172528-0042 YOU WANT THEM TO IMMORTALISE THAT FEROCIOUS TYRANT
lbi-3663-172528-0043 YOU HAVE NEVER MADE ANYTHING SO EXQUISITE WHICH PROVES YOU OUR INVETERATE FOE AND THEIR DEVOTED FRIEND AND YET THE POPE AND HE HAVE HAD IT TWICE IN MIND TO HANG YOU WITHOUT ANY FAULT OF YOURS
lbi-3663-172528-0044 IT WAS FIRMLY BELIEVED THAT DUKE ALESSANDRO WAS THE SON OF POPE CLEMENT
lbi-3663-172528-0045 MESSER FRANCESCO USED ALSO TO SAY AND SWEAR BY ALL HIS SAINTS THAT IF HE COULD HE WOULD HAVE ROBBED ME OF THE DIES FOR THAT MEDAL
lbi-3663-172528-0046 I RESPONDED THAT HE HAD DONE WELL TO TELL ME SO AND THAT I WOULD TAKE SUCH CARE OF THEM THAT HE SHOULD NEVER SEE THEM MORE
lbi-3663-172528-0047 I NOW SENT TO FLORENCE TO REQUEST LORENZINO THAT HE WOULD SEND ME THE REVERSE OF THE MEDAL
lbi-3663-172528-0048 NICCOLO DA MONTE AGUTO TO WHOM I HAD WRITTEN WROTE BACK SAYING THAT HE HAD SPOKEN TO THAT MAD MELANCHOLY PHILOSOPHER LORENZINO FOR IT HE HAD REPLIED THAT HE WAS THINKING NIGHT AND DAY OF NOTHING ELSE AND THAT HE WOULD FINISH IT AS SOON AS HE WAS ABLE
lbi-3663-172528-0049 NEVERTHELESS I WAS NOT TO SET MY HOPES UPON HIS REVERSE BUT I HAD BETTER INVENT ONE OUT OF MY OWN HEAD AND WHEN I HAD FINISHED IT I MIGHT BRING IT WITHOUT HESITATION TO THE DUKE FOR THIS WOULD BE TO MY ADVANTAGE
lbi-3663-172528-0050 I COMPOSED THE DESIGN OF A REVERSE WHICH SEEMED TO ME APPROPRIATE AND PRESSED THE WORK FORWARD TO MY BEST ABILITY
lbi-3663-172528-0051 THIS BEING SO AS HE WAS A FELLOW OF MUCH HUMOUR WE USED OFTEN TO LAUGH TOGETHER ABOUT THE GREAT CREDIT HE HAD GAINED
lbi-3663-172528-0052 I THEREFORE DISMOUNTED AT ONCE GOT MY FOWLING PIECE READY AND AT A VERY LONG RANGE BROUGHT TWO OF THEM DOWN WITH A SINGLE BALL
lbi-3663-172528-0053 I NEVER USED TO SHOOT WITH MORE THAN ONE BALL AND WAS USUALLY ABLE TO HIT MY MARK AT TWO HUNDRED CUBITS WHICH CANNOT BE DONE BY OTHER WAYS OF LOADING
lbi-3663-172528-0054 I LIFTED MY FOOT AND LET THE WATER RUN OUT THEN WHEN I HAD MOUNTED WE MADE HASTE FOR ROME
lbi-3915-57461-0000 WE HAVE SUCCEEDED IN AMASSING TWO HUNDRED OUNCES OF SILVER ENOUGH I TRUST TO ERECT A HANDSOME BRONZE FIGURE
lbi-3915-57461-0001 TO BE SURE IT SEEMS A SHAME YET IF I COULD STEAL THE MONEY THIS PRIEST IS BOASTING ABOUT I COULD LIVE AT EASE FOR THE REST OF MY DAYS AND SO HE BEGAN CASTING ABOUT HOW BEST HE MIGHT COMPASS HIS PURPOSE
lbi-3915-57461-0002 BUT THE PRIEST FAR FROM GUESSING THE DRIFT OF HIS COMRADE'S THOUGHTS JOURNEYED CHEERFULLY ON TILL THEY REACHED THE TOWN OF KUANA
lbi-3915-57461-0003 HERE THERE IS AN ARM OF THE SEA WHICH IS CROSSED IN FERRY BOATS THAT START AS SOON AS SOME TWENTY OR THIRTY PASSENGERS ARE GATHERED TOGETHER AND IN ONE OF THESE BOATS THE TWO TRAVELLERS EMBARKED
lbi-3915-57461-0004 WHEN THE BOATMEN AND PASSENGERS HEARD THE SPLASH AND SAW THE PRIEST STRUGGLING IN THE WATER THEY WERE AFRAID AND MADE EVERY EFFORT TO SAVE HIM BUT THE WIND WAS FAIR AND THE BOAT RUNNING SWIFTLY UNDER THE BELLYING SAILS SO THEY WERE SOON A FEW HUNDRED YARDS OFF FROM THE DROWNING MAN WHO SANK BEFORE THE BOAT COULD BE TURNED TO RESCUE HIM
lbi-3915-57461-0005 WHEN HE SAW THIS THE RONIN FEIGNED THE UTMOST GRIEF AND DISMAY AND SAID TO HIS FELLOW PASSENGERS THIS PRIEST WHOM WE HAVE JUST LOST WAS MY COUSIN HE WAS GOING TO KIYOTO TO VISIT THE SHRINE OF HIS PATRON AND AS I HAPPENED TO HAVE BUSINESS THERE AS WELL WE SETTLED TO TRAVEL TOGETHER
lbi-3915-57461-0006 NOW ALAS BY THIS MISFORTUNE MY COUSIN IS DEAD AND I AM LEFT ALONE
lbi-3915-57461-0007 HE SPOKE SO FEELINGLY AND WEPT SO FREELY THAT THE PASSENGERS BELIEVED HIS STORY AND PITIED AND TRIED TO COMFORT HIM
lbi-3915-57461-0008 THEN THE RONIN SAID TO THE BOATMEN
lbi-3915-57461-0009 WHAT THINK YOU GENTLEMEN ADDED HE TURNING TO THE OTHER TRAVELLERS
lbi-3915-57461-0010 THEY OF COURSE WERE ONLY TOO GLAD TO AVOID ANY HINDRANCE TO THEIR ONWARD JOURNEY AND ALL WITH ONE VOICE AGREED TO WHAT THE RONIN HAD PROPOSED AND SO THE MATTER WAS SETTLED
lbi-3915-57461-0011 WHEN AT LENGTH THEY REACHED THE SHORE THEY LEFT THE BOAT AND EVERY MAN WENT HIS WAY BUT THE RONIN OVERJOYED IN HIS HEART TOOK THE WANDERING PRIEST'S LUGGAGE AND PUTTING IT WITH HIS OWN PURSUED HIS JOURNEY TO KIYOTO
lbi-3915-57461-0012 FORTUNE FAVOURING HIS SPECULATIONS HE BEGAN TO AMASS GREAT WEALTH AND LIVED AT HIS EASE DENYING HIMSELF NOTHING AND IN COURSE OF TIME HE MARRIED A WIFE WHO BORE HIM A CHILD
lbi-3915-57461-0013 SINCE THEN ALL HAS GONE WELL WITH ME YET HAD I NOT BEEN POOR I HAD NEVER TURNED ASSASSIN NOR THIEF
lbi-3915-57461-0014 HE WOULD HAVE FLED INTO THE HOUSE BUT THE GHOST STRETCHED FORTH ITS WITHERED ARM AND CLUTCHING THE BACK OF HIS NECK SCOWLED AT HIM WITH A VINDICTIVE GLARE AND A HIDEOUS GHASTLINESS OF MIEN SO UNSPEAKABLY AWFUL THAT ANY ORDINARY MAN WOULD HAVE SWOONED WITH FEAR
lbi-3915-57461-0015 AT LENGTH UNDONE BY SUCH CEASELESS VEXATION TOKUBEI FELL ILL AND KEPT MUTTERING OH MISERY MISERY THE WANDERING PRIEST IS COMING TO TORTURE ME
lbi-3915-57461-0016 NOW IT CHANCED THAT THE STORY REACHED THE EARS OF A CERTAIN WANDERING PRIEST WHO LODGED IN THE NEXT STREET
lbi-3915-57461-0017 AND HIDING HIS HEAD UNDER THE COVERLET HE LAY QUIVERING ALL OVER
lbi-3915-57461-0018 THREE YEARS AGO AT THE KUANA FERRY YOU FLUNG ME INTO THE WATER AND WELL YOU REMEMBER IT
lbi-3915-57461-0019 HAPPILY CONTINUED THE PRIEST I HAD LEARNED TO SWIM AND TO DIVE AS A BOY SO I REACHED THE SHORE AND AFTER WANDERING THROUGH MANY PROVINCES SUCCEEDED IN SETTING UP A BRONZE FIGURE TO BUDDHA THUS FULFILLING THE WISH OF MY HEART
lbi-3915-57461-0020 ON MY JOURNEY HOMEWARDS I TOOK A LODGING IN THE NEXT STREET AND THERE HEARD OF YOUR MARVELLOUS AILMENT
lbi-3915-57461-0021 THINKING I COULD DIVINE ITS CAUSE I CAME TO SEE YOU AND AM GLAD TO FIND I WAS NOT MISTAKEN
lbi-3915-57461-0022 AND WOULD IT NOT ILL BECOME ME TO BEAR MALICE
lbi-3915-57461-0023 REPENT THEREFORE AND ABANDON YOUR EVIL WAYS
lbi-3915-57461-0024 TO SEE YOU DO SO I SHOULD ESTEEM THE HEIGHT OF HAPPINESS
lbi-3915-57461-0025 BE OF GOOD CHEER NOW AND LOOK ME IN THE FACE AND YOU WILL SEE THAT I AM REALLY A LIVING MAN AND NO VENGEFUL GOBLIN COME TO TORMENT YOU
lbi-3915-57461-0026 IN A FIT OF MADNESS I WAS TEMPTED TO KILL AND ROB YOU
lbi-3915-57461-0027 FORTUNE BEFRIENDED ME EVER AFTER BUT THE RICHER I GREW THE MORE KEENLY I FELT HOW WICKED I HAD BEEN AND THE MORE I FORESAW THAT MY VICTIM'S VENGEANCE WOULD SOME DAY OVERTAKE ME
lbi-3915-57461-0028 HAUNTED BY THIS THOUGHT I LOST MY NERVE TILL ONE NIGHT I BEHELD YOUR SPIRIT AND FROM THAT TIME FORTH FELL ILL
lbi-3915-57461-0029 BUT HOW YOU MANAGED TO ESCAPE AND ARE STILL ALIVE IS MORE THAN I CAN UNDERSTAND
lbi-3915-57461-0030 A GUILTY MAN SAID THE PRIEST WITH A SMILE SHUDDERS AT THE RUSTLING OF THE WIND OR THE CHATTERING OF A STORK'S BEAK A MURDERER'S CONSCIENCE PREYS UPON HIS MIND TILL HE SEES WHAT IS NOT
lbi-3915-98647-0000 EVERY WELL ORDERED JAPANESE HOME OF THE OLD FASHIONED KIND HAS ITS LITTLE SHRINE WHICH IS THE CENTRE OF THE RELIGIOUS LIFE OF THE HOUSE
lbi-3915-98647-0001 SHE IT IS WHO SETS THE RICE AND WINE BEFORE THE ANCESTRAL TABLETS WHO LIGHTS THE LITTLE LAMP EACH NIGHT AND WHO SEES THAT AT EACH FEAST DAY AND ANNIVERSARY SEASON THE PROPER FOOD IS PREPARED AND SET OUT FOR THE HOUSEHOLD GODS
lbi-3915-98647-0002 THESE MUST BE KEPT CAREFULLY BY THE MOTHER AS A SAFEGUARD AGAINST THE MANY EVILS THAT BESET CHILD LIFE
lbi-3915-98647-0003 VISITS TO NOTED TEMPLES BY RELATIVES AND FRIENDS OFTEN RESULT IN ADDITIONS TO THE CHILD'S COLLECTION
lbi-3915-98647-0004 ALL THESE ARE PUT TOGETHER BY THE CAREFUL MOTHER AND PRESERVED AS JEALOUSLY AS QUEEN ALTHEA KEPT THE CHARRED STICK THAT GOVERNED THE DESTINY OF HER SON
lbi-3915-98647-0005 AS THE CHILDREN ARRIVE AT YEARS OF DISCRETION THESE TREASURES PASS OUT OF THE MOTHER'S FAITHFUL KEEPING INTO THE HANDS OF THEIR ACTUAL OWNERS AND THEY ARE USUALLY KEPT STORED AWAY IN SOME LITTLE USED DRAWER OR CABINET UNTIL DEATH REMOVES THE NECESSITY FOR ANY FURTHER SAFEGUARDS OVER LIFE
lbi-3915-98647-0006 EACH ANIMAL BRINGS ITS OWN KIND OF GOOD OR BAD LUCK INTO THE HOUR DAY OR YEAR OVER WHICH IT PRESIDES AND ONLY A SKILLFUL BALANCER OF PROS AND CONS CAN READ ARIGHT THE COMBINATIONS AND UNDERSTAND WHAT THE LUCK OF ANY PARTICULAR HOUR IN ANY PARTICULAR DAY OF ANY PARTICULAR YEAR WILL BE
lbi-3915-98647-0007 FOR THE GREATER EVENTS OF FAMILY LIFE THE HOME PROPHECIES ARE FELT TO BE TOO UNCERTAIN AND THE SERVICES OF THE FORTUNE TELLER MUST BE CALLED IN
lbi-3915-98647-0008 NO WELL MANAGED FAMILY WOULD THINK OF BUILDING A NEW HOUSE WITHOUT FINDING IN WHAT DIRECTION TO FACE THE FRONT DOOR
lbi-3915-98647-0009 AFTER THIS MATTER HAS BEEN SETTLED AND THE HOUSE IS FAIRLY BEGUN THERE ARE OCCASIONAL CRISES IN ITS CONSTRUCTION UPON WHICH MUCH DEPENDS
lbi-3915-98647-0010 OF THESE THE MOST IMPORTANT IS THE DAY WHEN THE ROOF IS RAISED
lbi-3915-98647-0011 THE HOUSE OWNER THEN DECIDES WHETHER THE DAY SET BY THE BUILDER IS A LUCKY ONE FOR HIMSELF AND HIS FAMILY
lbi-3915-98647-0012 A PRESENT OF MONEY TO EACH WORKMAN IS ALSO IN ORDER AND WILL CONDUCE TO THE RAPID AND FAITHFUL EXECUTION OF THE JOB IN HAND WHEN AT LAST THE HOUSE IS FINISHED AND CARPENTERS AND PLASTERERS ARE READY TO LEAVE IT THE LOCAL FIREMEN WHO HAVE ASSISTED ALL ALONG IN THE BUILDING AS UNSKILLED LABORERS OFTEN ASCEND TO THE ROOF AND FROM THE RIDGE POLE CAST DOWN CAKES FOR WHICH THE CHILDREN OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD SCRAMBLE JOYFULLY
lbi-3915-98647-0013 ALL COME WHO CAN AND THOSE WHO CANNOT COME SEND SERVANTS OR PROVISIONS
lbi-3915-98647-0014 ON THE DAY AFTER THE DEATH OFTEN IN THE EVENING THE BODY MUST BE PLACED IN THE CASK SHAPED COFFIN THAT UNTIL RECENTLY WAS THE STYLE COMMONLY IN USE IN JAPAN
lbi-3915-98647-0015 NOW AMONG THE WEALTHIER CLASSES THE LONG COFFIN HAS SUPERSEDED THE SMALL SQUARE OR ROUND ONE BUT THE SMALLER EXPENSE CONNECTED WITH BURIAL IN THE OLD WAY MAKES THE SURVIVAL OF THE OLD TYPE A NECESSITY FOR THE MAJORITY OF JAPANESE
lbi-3915-98647-0016 AT AN APPOINTED TIME ALL THE RELATIVES ASSEMBLE IN THE DEATH CHAMBER AND PREPARATIONS ARE MADE FOR THE BATHING OF THE CORPSE
lbi-3915-98647-0017 THERE IS NO OFFICIAL CEREMONIAL MOURNING OF PARENTS FOR THEIR CHILDREN NOR DOES CUSTOM REQUIRE THEM TO PERFORM ANY OF THE LAST RITES OR ATTEND THE FUNERAL
lbi-3915-98647-0018 UPON THE YOUNGER BROTHERS AND SISTERS FALLS THE DUTY OF ATTENDING TO ALL THE LAST SAD MINISTRATIONS
lbi-3915-98647-0019 WHEN THE BODY HAS BEEN WASHED IT IS DRESSED IN WHITE IN SILK HABUTAI WHENEVER THE FAMILY CAN AFFORD IT
lbi-3915-98647-0020 THE BODY TO BE PLACED IN THE COFFIN MUST BE FOLDED INTO A SITTING POSTURE THE CHIN RESTING UPON THE KNEES THE POSITION OF THE MUMMIES FOUND IN MANY ABORIGINAL AMERICAN TOMBS
lbi-3915-98647-0021 THIS DIFFICULT TO US APPARENTLY IMPOSSIBLE FEAT SAFELY ACCOMPLISHED THERE ARE PLACED IN THE COFFIN A NUMBER OF SMALL THINGS THAT THE DEAD TAKES WITH HIM TO THE NEXT WORLD
lbi-3915-98647-0022 THE SINGLE EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE ABOUT METAL IS THAT SMALL COPPER COINS MAY BE PUT IN TO FEE THE OLD HAG WHO GUARDS THE BANK OF THE RIVER OF DEATH
lbi-3915-98647-0023 LAST OF ALL THE VACANT SPACES IN THE COFFIN ARE FILLED IN WITH BAGS OF TEA
lbi-3915-98647-0024 SO LONG AS THE COFFIN IS IN THE HOUSE IT MUST BE WATCHED OVER CONTINUALLY
lbi-3915-98647-0025 IT IS THEIR DUTY TO SEE THAT THE INCENSE BURNING BEFORE THE COFFIN IS NEVER ALLOWED TO GO OUT WHILE THE FOOD FOR THE DEAD IS RENEWED AT REGULAR INTERVALS BY THE MOURNERS THEMSELVES
lbi-3915-98647-0026 THERE ARE FEW ENLIGHTENED JAPANESE WHO WILL DEFEND THE PRESENT SYSTEM OF CRUELTY TO THE AFFLICTED OR WHO DO NOT LONG FOR SOME CHANGE BUT SO GREAT IS THE FORCE OF CONSERVATISM IN THIS REGARD SO HAUNTING THE FEAR THAT ANY CHANGE MAY INDICATE A LACK OF RESPECT FOR THE DEAD THAT REFORM ADVANCES SLOWLY
lbi-3915-98647-0027 INDIVIDUAL INSTANCES OCCUR IN WHICH SOME OF THE WORST FEATURES OF THESE CUSTOMS ARE MODIFIED
lbi-3915-98647-0028 A CASE IN POINT IS THAT OF THE LATE MISTER FUKUZAWA A MAN WHOSE LIFE WAS DEVOTED TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF HIS COUNTRYMEN IN MODERN WAYS AND WHO IN HIS DEATH CONTINUED HIS TEACHING
lbi-3915-98647-0029 IN HIS WILL HE PROVIDED THAT HIS BODY WAS TO BE BURIED WITHOUT WASHING IN THE CLOTHING IN WHICH HE DIED
lbi-3915-98647-0030 THROUGH THIS GROWING FEELING AND THE UNSELFISHNESS OF MATERNAL AFFECTION MAY COME IN TIME THE RELEASE FROM THESE MOURNFUL CEREMONIES
lbi-3915-98647-0031 JUST BEFORE THE PROCESSION STARTS A RELIGIOUS CEREMONY IS HELD AT THE HOUSE WHICH IS ATTENDED BY THE FRIENDS OF THE DECEASED AND WHICH IS SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME AS THAT PERFORMED AT THE CEMETERY
lbi-3915-98647-0032 ON THE DAY OF THE BURIAL GREAT BUNCHES OF NATURAL FLOWERS ARE SENT TO THE DEAD EACH BUNCH SO LARGE AS TO REQUIRE THE SERVICES OF ONE MAN TO CARRY IT
lbi-3915-98647-0033 SOMETIMES WITH THE GIFT A MAN IS SENT TO TAKE PART IN THE PROCESSION BUT IF THE GIVER FEELS TOO POOR TO HIRE A MAN THIS BURDEN TOO FALLS UPON THE BEREAVED HOUSEHOLD FOR ETIQUETTE REQUIRES THAT ALL FLOWERS SENT BE BORNE TO THE GRAVE BY UNIFORMED COOLIES WHO MARCH IN THE FUNERAL TRAIN
lbi-3915-98647-0034 ANOTHER FAVORITE PRESENT AT THIS TIME AMONG BUDDHISTS IS A CAGE OF LIVING BIRDS TO BE BORNE TO THE GRAVE AND RELEASED THEREON
lbi-3915-98647-0035 IT SEEMS MORE LIKE A BRIDAL THAN A BURIAL
lbi-3915-98647-0036 DURING THIS PERIOD THE SPIRIT OF THE DECEASED IS SUPPOSED TO BE STILL INHABITING THE HOUSE AND A TABLET OR SHRINE IS SET UP IN THE DEATH CHAMBER BEFORE WHICH FOOD AND FLOWERS ARE RENEWED DAILY
lbi-4153-185072-0000 HE TARRIED AT GENISHAU A FEW DAYS AND CAME UP TO GARDOW WHERE I THEN RESIDED HE WAS APPARENTLY WITHOUT ANY BUSINESS THAT WOULD SUPPORT HIM BUT HE SOON BECAME ACQUAINTED WITH MY SON THOMAS WITH WHOM HE HUNTED FOR A LONG TIME AND MADE HIS HOME WITH HIM AT MY HOUSE WINTER CAME ON AND HE CONTINUED HIS STAY
lbi-4153-185072-0001 THE ENRAGED HUSBAND WELL KNOWING THAT HE SHOULD FEEL A BLOW IF HE WAITED TO HEAR THE ORDER REPEATED INSTANTLY RETREATED AND WENT DOWN THE RIVER TO HIS CATTLE
lbi-4153-185072-0002 WE PROTECTED THE POOR NANTICOKE WOMAN AND GAVE HER VICTUALS AND ALLEN SYMPATHIZED WITH HER IN HER MISFORTUNES TILL SPRING WHEN HER HUSBAND CAME TO HER ACKNOWLEDGED HIS FORMER ERRORS AND THAT HE HAD ABUSED HER WITHOUT A CAUSE PROMISED A REFORMATION AND SHE RECEIVED HIM WITH EVERY MARK OF A RENEWAL OF HER AFFECTION
lbi-4153-185072-0003 THE INDIANS WERE SOON ANSWERED BY THE AMERICAN OFFICER THAT THE WAMPUM WAS CORDIALLY ACCEPTED AND THAT A CONTINUANCE OF PEACE WAS ARDENTLY WISHED FOR
lbi-4153-185072-0004 MY SON THOMAS WENT WITH THEM WITH ALLEN'S HORSE AND CARRIED THE GOODS
lbi-4153-185072-0005 ALLEN ON FINDING THAT HIS ENEMIES HAD GONE CAME BACK TO MY HOUSE WHERE HE LIVED AS BEFORE BUT OF HIS RETURN THEY WERE SOON NOTIFIED AT NIAGARA AND NETTLES WHO MARRIED PRISCILLA RAMSAY WITH A SMALL PARTY OF INDIANS CAME ON TO TAKE HIM
lbi-4153-185072-0006 NETTLES AT LENGTH ABANDONED THE CHASE WENT HOME AND ALLEN ALL IN TATTERS CAME IN
lbi-4153-185072-0007 BY RUNNING IN THE WOODS HIS CLOTHING HAD BECOME TORN INTO RAGS SO THAT HE WAS IN A SUFFERING CONDITION ALMOST NAKED
lbi-4153-185072-0008 ALLEN MADE HIS TROWSERS HIMSELF AND THEN BUILT A RAFT ON WHICH HE WENT DOWN THE RIVER TO HIS OWN PLACE AT MOUNT MORRIS
lbi-4153-185072-0009 THERE AN INDIAN GAVE HIM SOME REFRESHMENT AND A GOOD GUN WITH WHICH HE HASTENED ON TO LITTLE BEARD'S TOWN WHERE HE FOUND HIS SQUAW
lbi-4153-185072-0010 NOT DARING TO RISK HIMSELF AT THAT PLACE FOR FEAR OF BEING GIVEN UP HE MADE HER BUT A SHORT VISIT AND CAME IMMEDIATELY TO GARDOW
lbi-4153-185072-0011 THE LOVE OF LIBERTY HOWEVER ADDED TO HIS NATURAL SWIFTNESS GAVE HIM SUFFICIENT STRENGTH TO MAKE HIS ESCAPE TO HIS FORMER CASTLE OF SAFETY
lbi-4153-185072-0012 HIS PURSUERS CAME IMMEDIATELY TO MY HOUSE WHERE THEY EXPECTED TO HAVE FOUND HIM SECRETED AND UNDER MY PROTECTION
lbi-4153-185072-0013 STILL UNSATISFIED AND DOUBTING MY VERACITY THEY ADVISED MY INDIAN BROTHER TO USE HIS INFLUENCE TO DRAW FROM ME THE SECRET OF HIS CONCEALMENT WHICH THEY HAD AN IDEA THAT I CONSIDERED OF GREAT IMPORTANCE NOT ONLY TO HIM BUT TO MYSELF I PERSISTED IN MY IGNORANCE OF HIS SITUATION AND FINALLY THEY LEFT ME
lbi-4153-185072-0014 HE CAME TO MY HOUSE IN THE NIGHT AND AWOKE ME WITH THE GREATEST CAUTION FEARING THAT SOME OF HIS ENEMIES MIGHT BE WATCHING TO TAKE HIM AT A TIME WHEN AND IN A PLACE WHERE IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO MAKE HIS ESCAPE
lbi-4153-185072-0015 AT THAT TIME ALLEN LAY IN A SECRET PLACE IN THE GULPH A SHORT DISTANCE ABOVE MY FLATS IN A HOLE THAT HE ACCIDENTALLY FOUND IN THE ROCK NEAR THE RIVER
lbi-4153-186222-0000 THERE'S LITTLE DANGER IN THIS QUARTER I'M SURE SO I MAY AS WELL BE FRIENDS WITH THE POOR CHILD
lbi-4153-186222-0001 AH WHY NOT
lbi-4153-186222-0002 BETH HESITATED
lbi-4153-186222-0003 THE LETTER ASKING ME TO VISIT HER WAS THE FIRST I HAVE EVER RECEIVED FROM HER
lbi-4153-186222-0004 BUT SINCE SHE ASKED ME TO VISIT HER WE JUDGED SHE HAD SOFTENED AND MIGHT WISH TO BECOME FRIENDLY AND SO I ACCEPTED THE INVITATION
lbi-4153-186222-0005 SURELY TWO GIRLS WILL HAVE A BETTER TIME IN THIS LONELY OLD PLACE THAN ONE COULD HAVE ALONE
lbi-4153-186222-0006 OH YES SHE HAS CORRECTED LOUISE
lbi-4153-186222-0007 YOU MEAN PATRICIA DOYLE YES
lbi-4153-186222-0008 THEN WE MAY CONCLUDE SHE'S LEFT OUT OF THE ARRANGEMENT SAID BETH CALMLY
lbi-4153-186222-0009 YOU'LL FIGHT FOR YOUR CHANCE AND FIGHT MIGHTY HARD
lbi-4153-186222-0010 WHY MY DEAR COUSIN I DON'T WANT AUNT JANE'S MONEY
lbi-4153-186222-0011 MY MOTHER AND I ARE AMPLY PROVIDED FOR AND I AM ONLY HERE TO FIND REST FROM MY SOCIAL DUTIES AND TO GET ACQUAINTED WITH MY DEAD FATHER'S SISTER THAT IS ALL
lbi-4153-186222-0012 MY FATHER TEACHES MUSIC AND MOTHER SCOLDS HIM CONTINUALLY FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO EARN ENOUGH MONEY TO KEEP OUT OF DEBT
lbi-4153-186222-0013 WE'VE NEVER SEEN A CENT OF HER MONEY ALTHOUGH FATHER HAS TRIED AT TIMES TO BORROW ENOUGH TO HELP HIM OUT OF HIS DIFFICULTIES
lbi-4153-186222-0014 I EVEN KISSED HER WHEN SHE ASKED ME TO AND IT SENT A SHIVER ALL DOWN MY BACK
lbi-4153-186222-0015 FOR MY PART I AM FOND OF EVERYONE AND IT DELIGHTS ME TO FUSS AROUND INVALIDS AND ASSIST THEM
lbi-4153-186222-0016 YOU SAY YOU LIKE TO CARE FOR INVALIDS AND I DON'T
lbi-4153-186222-0017 YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE ME THINK YOU DON'T WANT ELMHURST WHEN YOU'RE AS ANXIOUS TO GET IT AS I AM
lbi-4153-186222-0018 THEY CALL ME BETH SULLENLY
lbi-4153-186222-0019 I COULDN'T LIVE IN THIS OUT OF THE WAY CORNER OF THE WORLD YOU KNOW
lbi-4153-186222-0020 BUT SUPPOSE SHE LEAVES IT TO YOU PERSISTED BETH
lbi-4153-186222-0021 LOUISE SEEMED TO MEDITATE
lbi-4153-186222-0022 IT'S A MAGNIFICENT ESTATE SAID BETH LOOKING AT HER COUSIN DOUBTFULLY
lbi-4153-186222-0023 NOW SHALL WE BE FRIENDS SHE ASKED LIGHTLY
lbi-4153-186222-0024 TO BE SURE I SHOULD WANT YOU TO MY DEAR
lbi-4153-186222-0025 SUCH A GIRL FRIEND IT HAD NEVER BEEN HER PRIVILEGE TO HAVE BEFORE AND WHEN HER SUSPICIONS WERE FORGOTTEN SHE BECAME FAIRLY RESPONSIVE AND BRIGHTENED WONDERFULLY
lbi-4153-186222-0026 SILAS SHE SAID WHEN HE ENTERED WHAT DO YOU THINK OF MY NIECES
lbi-4153-186222-0027 THEY ARE VERY CHARMING GIRLS HE ANSWERED ALTHOUGH THEY ARE AT AN AGE WHEN FEW GIRLS SHOW TO GOOD ADVANTAGE
lbi-4153-186222-0028 WHY DID YOU NOT INVITE KENNETH TO DINNER JANE THE BOY
lbi-4153-186222-0029 HE IS CONSTANTLY SAYING DISAGREEABLE THINGS
lbi-4153-186222-0030 VERY WELL SAID THE LAWYER QUIETLY WHICH OF MY NIECES DO YOU PREFER
lbi-4153-186222-0031 ASKED THE OLD LADY AFTER A PAUSE I CANNOT SAY ON SO SHORT AN ACQUAINTANCE HE ANSWERED WITH GRAVITY WHICH DO YOU PREFER JANE
lbi-4153-186222-0032 THEY ARE EQUALLY UNSATISFACTORY SHE ANSWERED
lbi-4153-186222-0033 I CANNOT IMAGINE ELMHURST BELONGING TO EITHER SILAS
lbi-4153-186222-0034 I MUST SEE THAT OTHER NIECE THE ONE WHO DEFIES ME AND REFUSES TO ANSWER MY SECOND LETTER
lbi-4153-186222-0035 THERE WOULD BE A DOZEN HEIRS TO FIGHT FOR MY MONEY AND DEAR OLD ELMHURST WOULD BE SOLD TO STRANGERS SHE RESUMED WITH BITTERNESS
lbi-4153-186223-0000 IN ONE CORNER OF THE LITTLE ROOM KENNETH FORBES SQUATTED UPON A BENCH WITH AN EMPTY PINE BOX HELD CARELESSLY IN HIS LAP
lbi-4153-186223-0001 WHILE DUNCAN WORKED THE BOY WAS BUSY WITH HIS PENCIL BUT NEITHER HAD SPOKEN FOR AT LEAST A HALF HOUR
lbi-4153-186223-0002 THEN RIDING SLOWLY UP THE HEDGE BORDERED ROAD HIS TROUBLES ONCE MORE ASSAILED HIM AND HE WONDERED IF THERE WAS NOT SOME SPOT UPON THE BROAD EARTH TO WHICH HE COULD FLY FOR RETIREMENT UNTIL THE GIRLS HAD LEFT ELMHURST FOR GOOD
lbi-4153-186223-0003 NORA SHIED AND HE LOOKED UP TO DISCOVER THAT HE HAD NEARLY RUN DOWN A PEDESTRIAN A STOUT LITTLE MAN WITH A BUNDLE UNDER HIS ARM WHO HELD UP ONE HAND AS IF TO ARREST HIM
lbi-4153-186223-0004 WHERE DO YOU WANT TO GO ASKED THE BOY
lbi-4153-186223-0005 THEN IT'S THE SAME JANE AS EVER HE RESPONDED WITH A SHAKE OF HIS GRIZZLED HEAD
lbi-4153-186223-0006 DO YOU KNOW I SORT O HOPED SHE'D REFORMED AND I'D BE GLAD TO SEE HER AGAIN THEY TELL ME SHE'S GOT MONEY
lbi-4153-186223-0007 AUNT JANE'S RICH AUNT JANE
lbi-4153-186223-0008 ECHOED THE MAN QUICKLY WHAT'S YOUR NAME LAD
lbi-4153-186223-0009 DON'T LIKE GIRLS I TAKE IT
lbi-4153-186223-0010 ANOTHER LONG PAUSE THEN THE BOY SUDDENLY TURNED QUESTIONER
lbi-4153-186223-0011 YOU KNOW AUNT MISS MERRICK SIR
lbi-4153-186223-0012 I USED TO WHEN WE WERE BOTH YOUNGER
lbi-4153-186223-0013 KENNETH STOPPED SHORT AND THE MARE STOPPED AND THE LITTLE MAN WITH A WHIMSICAL SMILE AT THE BOY'S ASTONISHMENT ALSO STOPPED
lbi-4153-186223-0014 JOHN MERRICK THAT'S ME
lbi-4153-186223-0015 YOU WERE THE TINSMITH
lbi-4153-186223-0016 THEY KEPT TRACK OF HER BECAUSE SHE SUDDENLY BECAME RICH AND A GREAT LADY AND THAT WAS A SURPRISING THING TO HAPPEN TO A MERRICK
lbi-4153-186223-0017 THANK YOU LAD RETURNED THE MAN GRATEFULLY I THOUGHT A LITTLE EXERCISE WOULD DO ME GOOD BUT THIS THREE MILES HAS SEEMED LIKE THIRTY TO ME
lbi-4153-186223-0018 I WILL SAID THE MAN
lbi-4153-186223-0019 THE BOY TURNED AWAY BUT IN A MOMENT HALTED AGAIN
lbi-4153-186223-0020 HIS INTEREST IN MISS JANE'S BROTHER JOHN WAS EXTRAORDINARY
lbi-4153-61735-0000 THEY ARE BUT LUKEWARM LOVERS WHO CAN CONTENT THEMSELVES WITH A DIALOGUE CARRIED ON AT BOWSHOT DISTANCE
lbi-4153-61735-0001 IF THERE BE AN ELYSIUM ON EARTH IT IS THIS
lbi-4153-61735-0002 HIS OWN DAUGHTER HIS ONLY DAUGHTER OF THE BEST BLOOD OF SOUTHERN ARISTOCRACY BEAUTIFUL ACCOMPLISHED EVERYTHING TO SECURE HIM A SPLENDID ALLIANCE HOLDING NIGHTLY ASSIGNATION WITH A HORSE HUNTER
lbi-4153-61735-0003 HE COULD WELL CONCEDE SO MUCH TO HER CAPRICE SINCE HER STAYING AT HOME COULD BE NO DISADVANTAGE TO THE CAUSE THAT HAD PROMPTED HIM TO THE STERN COUNSEL
lbi-4153-61735-0004 IT IS ALREADY KNOWN THAT THIS ROAD PASSED THE HACIENDA OF CASA DEL CORVO AT SOME DISTANCE FROM THE HOUSE AND ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE RIVER
lbi-4153-61735-0005 ON REACHING THE COPSE HE DISMOUNTED LED HIS HORSE IN AMONG THE UNDERWOOD HITCHED HIM BY LOOPING HIS BRIDLE REIN AROUND THE TOPMOST TWIGS OF AN ELASTIC BOUGH THEN DETACHING A LONG ROPE OF TWISTED HORSEHAIR FROM THE HORN OF HIS SADDLE AND INSERTING HIS ARM INTO ITS COIL HE GLIDED OUT TO THE EDGE OF THE ISLAND ON THAT SIDE THAT LAY TOWARDS THE HACIENDA
lbi-4153-61735-0006 BEFORE FORSAKING THE SHADOW OF THE COPSE HE CAST A GLANCE TOWARDS THE SKY AND AT THE MOON SAILING SUPREMELY OVER IT
lbi-4153-61735-0007 THE DROLL CONCEIT WHICH HAS SO OFT AMUSED THE NOCTURNAL INEBRIATE OF GREAT CITIES APPEARED TO PRODUCE A LIKE AFFECT UPON THE NIGHT PATROLLER OF THE PRAIRIE AND FOR A MOMENT THE SHADOW LATE DARKENING HIS BROW DISAPPEARED
lbi-4153-61735-0008 IT'S NOT LIKELY AT THIS HOUR UNLESS IT BE THE OWNER OF A BAD CONSCIENCE WHO CAN'T SLEEP
lbi-4153-61735-0009 TROTH THERE'S ONE SUCH WITHIN THOSE WALLS
lbi-4153-61735-0010 IF HE BE ABROAD THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE OF HIS SEEING ME ON THE OPEN GROUND NOT THAT I SHOULD CARE A STRAW IF IT WERE ONLY MYSELF TO BE COMPROMISED
lbi-4153-61735-0011 IT'S NO USE WAITING UPON THE MOON DEUCE TAKE HER
lbi-4153-61735-0012 IT IS TRUE HE HAD DESIGNS UPON THE HACIENDA BUT THESE DID NOT CONTEMPLATE EITHER ITS CASH PLATE OR JEWELLERY IF WE EXCEPT THE MOST PRECIOUS JEWEL IT CONTAINED THE MISTRESS OF THE MANSION HERSELF
lbi-4323-13259-0000 THE CHURCH BELLS WERE RINGING AND PEOPLE ON THE AVENUE GOING BY TO SERVICE TURNED CURIOUS INQUIRING LOOKS UP AT THE GREAT HOUSE AND THEN WENT ON TALKING OF THE RECENT EVENTS WHICH HAD SO STRANGELY ENTERED INTO AND MADE HISTORY IN THE CITY
lbi-4323-13259-0001 AND ALL THROUGH HIS IMPASSIONED APPEAL THIS MORNING THERE WAS A NOTE OF SADNESS AND REBUKE AND STERN CONDEMNATION THAT MADE MANY OF THE MEMBERS PALE WITH SELF ACCUSATION OR WITH INWARD ANGER
lbi-4323-13259-0002 RAYMOND HAD VOTED TO CONTINUE FOR ANOTHER YEAR THE SALOON
lbi-4323-13259-0003 THE CHRISTIANS OF RAYMOND STOOD CONDEMNED BY THE RESULT
lbi-4323-13259-0004 FOR THAT HAD BEEN THE FACT IN RAYMOND FOR YEARS THE SALOON RULED
lbi-4323-13259-0005 PRESIDENT MARSH SAT THERE HIS USUAL ERECT HANDSOME FIRM BRIGHT SELF CONFIDENT BEARING ALL GONE HIS HEAD BOWED UPON HIS BREAST THE GREAT TEARS ROLLING DOWN HIS CHEEKS UNMINDFUL OF THE FACT THAT NEVER BEFORE HAD HE SHOWN OUTWARD EMOTION IN A PUBLIC SERVICE
lbi-4323-13259-0006 WHAT IF HE HAD BEGUN TO DO AS JESUS WOULD HAVE DONE LONG AGO
lbi-4323-13259-0007 WHEN HAD THE FIRST CHURCH YIELDED TO SUCH A BAPTISM OF TEARS
lbi-4323-13259-0008 WHAT HAD BECOME OF ITS REGULAR PRECISE CONVENTIONAL ORDER OF SERVICE UNDISTURBED BY ANY VULGAR EMOTION AND UNMOVED BY ANY FOOLISH EXCITEMENT
lbi-4323-13259-0009 THEY HAD BEEN LIVING SO LONG ON THEIR SURFACE FEELINGS THAT THEY HAD ALMOST FORGOTTEN THE DEEPER WELLS OF LIFE
lbi-4323-13259-0010 THE MEETING WAS TENDER IT GLOWED WITH THE SPIRIT'S PRESENCE IT WAS ALIVE WITH STRONG AND LASTING RESOLVE TO BEGIN A WAR ON THE WHISKEY POWER IN RAYMOND THAT WOULD BREAK ITS REIGN FOREVER
lbi-4323-13259-0011 SINCE THE FIRST SUNDAY WHEN THE FIRST COMPANY OF VOLUNTEERS HAD PLEDGED THEMSELVES TO DO AS JESUS WOULD DO THE DIFFERENT MEETINGS HAD BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY DISTINCT IMPULSES OR IMPRESSIONS
lbi-4323-13259-0012 AND ALL THROUGH IT RAN ONE GENERAL CRY FOR DELIVERANCE FROM THE SALOON AND ITS AWFUL CURSE
lbi-4323-13259-0013 GRAY AND HIS WIFE WERE BESIEGED BY INQUIRERS WHO WANTED TO KNOW WHAT LOREEN'S FRIENDS AND ACQUAINTANCES WERE EXPECTED TO DO IN PAYING THEIR LAST RESPECTS TO HER
lbi-4323-13259-0014 GRAY HAD GONE UP TO VIRGINIA'S AND AFTER TALKING IT OVER WITH HER AND MAXWELL THE ARRANGEMENT HAD BEEN MADE
lbi-4323-13259-0015 I AM AND ALWAYS HAVE BEEN OPPOSED TO LARGE PUBLIC FUNERALS SAID GRAY WHOSE COMPLETE WHOLESOME SIMPLICITY OF CHARACTER WAS ONE OF ITS GREAT SOURCES OF STRENGTH BUT THE CRY OF THE POOR CREATURES WHO KNEW LOREEN IS SO EARNEST THAT I DO NOT KNOW HOW TO REFUSE THIS DESIRE TO SEE HER AND PAY HER POOR BODY SOME LAST LITTLE HONOR WHAT DO YOU THINK MISTER MAXWELL
lbi-4323-13259-0016 I WILL BE GUIDED BY YOUR JUDGMENT IN THE MATTER
lbi-4323-13259-0017 I AM SURE THAT WHATEVER YOU AND MISS PAGE THINK BEST WILL BE RIGHT
lbi-4323-13259-0018 UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES I HAVE A GREAT DISTASTE FOR WHAT SEEMS LIKE DISPLAY AT SUCH TIMES BUT THIS SEEMS DIFFERENT
lbi-4323-13259-0019 IT HAPPENED THAT THAT AFTERNOON A SOMEWHAT NOTED NEWSPAPER CORRESPONDENT WAS PASSING THROUGH RAYMOND ON HIS WAY TO AN EDITORIAL CONVENTION IN A NEIGHBORING CITY
lbi-4323-13259-0020 SHE WAS A COMMON STREET DRUNKARD AND YET THE SERVICES AT THE TENT WERE AS IMPRESSIVE AS ANY I EVER WITNESSED IN A METROPOLITAN CHURCH OVER THE MOST DISTINGUISHED CITIZEN
lbi-4323-13259-0021 IT STRUCK ME OF COURSE BEING A STRANGER IN THE PLACE WITH CONSIDERABLE ASTONISHMENT TO HEAR VOICES LIKE THOSE ONE NATURALLY EXPECTS TO HEAR ONLY IN GREAT CHURCHES OR CONCERTS AT SUCH A MEETING AS THIS
lbi-4323-13259-0022 MISTER MAXWELL SPOKE OF THE FACT THAT THE DEAD WOMAN HAD BEEN FULLY PREPARED TO GO BUT HE SPOKE IN A PECULIARLY SENSITIVE MANNER OF THE EFFECT OF THE LIQUOR BUSINESS ON THE LIVES OF MEN AND WOMEN LIKE THIS ONE
lbi-4323-13259-0023 RAYMOND OF COURSE BEING A RAILROAD TOWN AND THE CENTRE OF THE GREAT PACKING INTERESTS FOR THIS REGION IS FULL OF SALOONS
lbi-4323-13259-0024 THEN FOLLOWED WHAT WAS PERHAPS THE QUEER PART OF THIS STRANGE SERVICE
lbi-4323-13259-0025 IT WAS ONE OF THE SIMPLEST AND AT THE SAME TIME ONE OF THE MOST IMPRESSIVE SIGHTS I EVER WITNESSED
lbi-4323-13259-0026 THERE MUST HAVE BEEN A HUNDRED OF THESE WOMEN AND I WAS TOLD MANY OF THEM HAD BEEN CONVERTED AT THE MEETINGS JUST RECENTLY
lbi-4323-18416-0000 THERE WAS NO ANSWER AND AFTER ONE OR TWO INEFFECTUAL ATTEMPTS PHRONSIE TURNED FEARFULLY AWAY
lbi-4323-18416-0001 I'LL TRY AND SHE LAID A QUICK HAND ON THE KNOB
lbi-4323-18416-0002 TWO RED SPOTS BURNED ON HER CHEEKS AND HER PALE BLUE EYES SNAPPED
lbi-4323-18416-0003 OH I'M SURE I HEARD IT RAGING UP AND DOWN
lbi-4323-18416-0004 I DON'T WANT ANY DINNER SAID CHARLOTTE DRAWING BACK
lbi-4323-18416-0005 YES INDEED SAID POLLY CHEERILY JUST AS FINE AS CAN BE
lbi-4323-18416-0006 ASSUREDLY SAID OLD MISTER KING WITH GREAT SATISFACTION IN POLLY'S PLEASURE AND AT HER SUCCESS IN DRAWING CHARLOTTE OUT
lbi-4323-18416-0007 AND AFTER THIS THERE WERE NO MORE QUIET DAYS FOR CHARLOTTE CHATTERTON
lbi-4323-18416-0008 OH BLESS ME IT'S YOU PHRONSIE IN PLEASED SURPRISE
lbi-4323-18416-0009 YES GRANDPAPA SAID PHRONSIE COMING IN AND SHUTTING THE DOOR CAREFULLY I CAME ON PURPOSE TO SEE YOU ALL ALONE
lbi-4323-18416-0010 SO YOU DID DEAR SAID MISTER KING HIGHLY GRATIFIED AND PUSHING AWAY HIS WRITING TABLE HE HELD OUT HIS HAND
lbi-4323-18416-0011 OH NO GRANDPAPA CRIED PHRONSIE IN A RAPTURE I COULD NEVER BE TOO BIG FOR THAT SO SHE PERCHED UP AS OF OLD ON HIS KNEE THEN SHE FOLDED HER HANDS AND LOOKED GRAVELY IN HIS FACE
lbi-4323-18416-0012 WELL MY DEAR WHAT IS IT
lbi-4323-18416-0013 ASKED THE OLD GENTLEMAN PRESENTLY YOU'VE COME TO TELL ME SOMETHING I SUPPOSE
lbi-4323-18416-0014 YES GRANDPAPA I HAVE SAID PHRONSIE DECIDEDLY AND IT IS MOST IMPORTANT TOO GRANDPAPA AND OH I DO WISH IT SO MUCH AND SHE CLASPED HER HANDS TIGHTER AND SIGHED
lbi-4323-18416-0015 WELL THEN PHRONSIE IF YOU WANT IT I SUPPOSE IT MUST BE SAID MISTER KING QUITE AS A MATTER OF COURSE
lbi-4323-18416-0016 OH SHE LEFT YOU EVERYTHING SHE HAD PHRONSIE A COUPLE OF MILLIONS OR SO IT IS WHY
lbi-4323-18416-0017 CHARLOTTE POOR REPEATED THE OLD GENTLEMAN
lbi-4323-18416-0018 WHY NO NOT EXACTLY HER FATHER ISN'T RICH BUT CHARLOTTE I THINK MAY DO VERY WELL ESPECIALLY AS I INTEND TO KEEP HER HERE FOR A WHILE AND THEN I SHALL NEVER LET HER SUFFER PHRONSIE NEVER INDEED
lbi-4323-18416-0019 GRANDPAPA SAID PHRONSIE WASN'T MISSUS CHATTERTON AUNT TO CHARLOTTE
lbi-4323-18416-0020 IF MISSUS CHATTERTON WAS AUNT TO CHARLOTTE PERSISTED PHRONSIE SLOWLY IT SEEMS AS IF CHARLOTTE OUGHT TO HAVE SOME OF THE MONEY IT REALLY DOES GRANDPAPA
lbi-4323-18416-0021 MAYBE SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN WITH A SHORT LAUGH AND I SHOULDN'T WONDER IF COUSIN EUNICE WAS SORRY OVER A FEW OTHER THINGS TOO PHRONSIE
lbi-4323-18416-0022 WOULDN'T IT MAKE HER VERY GLAD IF I GAVE CHARLOTTE SOME OF THE MONEY
lbi-4323-18416-0023 FOR ANSWER MISTER KING SET HER DOWN HASTILY ON THE FLOOR AND TOOK TWO OR THREE TURNS UP AND DOWN THE ROOM
lbi-4323-18416-0024 OH I DO SO WISH I MIGHT SHE SAID THERE'S SO MUCH FOR A LITTLE GIRL LIKE ME
lbi-4323-18416-0025 IT WOULD BE SO NICE TO HAVE CHARLOTTE HAVE SOME WITH ME STILL NO ANSWER
lbi-4323-18416-0026 I WAS WRITING A NOTE TO MISSUS FARGO SAID PHRONSIE PUTTING UP HER LIPS FOR A KISS
lbi-4323-18416-0027 SURE AS I CAN BE PHRONSIE SAID OLD MISTER KING SMILING GOOD BY DEAR
lbi-4323-18416-0028 THERE THERE MY SISTER'S BOY SHALL NEVER SAY THAT BUT COME IN COME IN
lbi-4323-18416-0029 NOT TO BE UNGRACIOUS THE YOUNG MAN THREW HIMSELF INTO A CHAIR
lbi-4323-18416-0030 OH HANG IT UNCLE WHY CAN'T YOU LET ME ALONE
lbi-4323-18416-0031 WHICH IS A WONDER INTERPOLATED PICKERING
lbi-4323-18416-0032 I KNOW YOU DID UNCLE SAID PICKERING YOU'VE DONE EVERYTHING THAT'S GOOD
lbi-4323-18416-0033 FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE PICKERING CRIED HIS UNCLE DARTING IN FRONT OF THE CHAIR AND ITS RESTLESS OCCUPANT DON'T SAY THAT AGAIN
lbi-4323-18416-0034 I'VE BEEN A LAZY DOG ALL MY LIFE AND A GOOD FOR NAUGHT BUT I HOPE I'VE NOT SUNK TO THAT
lbi-4323-55228-0000 THE NEXT MOMENT HE FELL BACK IN AMAZEMENT BEFORE THE IMPETUOUS RUSH OF A STARRY EYED FLUSHED CHEEKED YOUNG WOMAN WHO DEMANDED
lbi-4323-55228-0001 WHERE IS HE PETE MISS BILLY GASPED THE OLD MAN
lbi-4323-55228-0002 AUNT HANNAH'S CHEEKS TOO WERE FLUSHED AND HER EYES STARRY BUT WITH DISMAY AND ANGER THE LAST BECAUSE SHE DID NOT LIKE THE WAY PETE HAD SAID MISS BILLY'S NAME
lbi-4323-55228-0003 IT WAS ONE MATTER FOR HER TO OBJECT TO THIS THING BILLY WAS DOING BUT QUITE ANOTHER FOR PETE TO DO IT OF COURSE IT'S SHE
lbi-4323-55228-0004 RETORTED AUNT HANNAH TESTILY AS IF YOU YOURSELF DIDN'T BRING HER HERE WITH YOUR CRAZY MESSAGES AT THIS TIME OF NIGHT PETE WHERE IS HE
lbi-4323-55228-0005 INTERPOSED BILLY TELL MISTER BERTRAM I AM HERE OR WAIT I'LL GO RIGHT IN AND SURPRISE HIM
lbi-4323-55228-0006 PETE HAD RECOVERED HIMSELF BY NOW BUT HE DID NOT EVEN GLANCE TOWARD AUNT HANNAH
lbi-4323-55228-0007 MISS BILLY MISS BILLY YOU'RE AN ANGEL STRAIGHT FROM HEAVEN YOU ARE YOU ARE OH I'M SO GLAD YOU CAME
lbi-4323-55228-0008 IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT NOW ALL RIGHT HE'S IN THE DEN MISS BILLY
lbi-4323-55228-0009 BILLY TURNED EAGERLY BUT BEFORE SHE COULD TAKE SO MUCH AS ONE STEP TOWARD THE DOOR AT THE END OF THE HALL AUNT HANNAH'S INDIGNANT VOICE ARRESTED HER BILLY STOP
lbi-4323-55228-0010 PETE GO TELL YOUR MASTER THAT WE ARE HERE AND ASK IF HE WILL RECEIVE US PETE'S LIPS TWITCHED
lbi-4323-55228-0011 BUT HIS FACE WAS PRETERNATURALLY GRAVE WHEN HE SPOKE
lbi-4323-55228-0012 A FLYING FIGURE BRUSHED BY HIM AND FELL ON ITS KNEES BY THE COUCH WITH A LOW CRY BERTRAM'S EYES FLEW OPEN
lbi-4323-55228-0013 DONG LING FOUND HIM THERE A MINUTE LATER POLISHING A SILVER TEASPOON WITH A FRINGED NAPKIN THAT HAD BEEN SPREAD OVER BERTRAM'S TRAY
lbi-4323-55228-0014 IN THE HALL ABOVE AUNT HANNAH WAS CRYING INTO WILLIAM'S GRAY LINEN DUSTER THAT HUNG ON THE HALL RACK AUNT HANNAH'S HANDKERCHIEF WAS ON THE FLOOR BACK AT HILLSIDE
lbi-4323-55228-0015 THEN VERY GRADUALLY IT DAWNED OVER THEM THAT THERE WAS AFTER ALL SOMETHING STRANGE AND UNEXPLAINED IN IT ALL
lbi-4323-55228-0016 AS IF TO MAKE SURE THAT SHE WAS HERE LIKE THIS HE DREW HER EVEN CLOSER BERTRAM WAS SO THANKFUL THAT HE DID HAVE ONE ARM THAT WAS USABLE
lbi-4323-55228-0017 WHY OF OF COURSE STAMMERED BILLY I COULDN'T HELP THINKING THAT MAYBE YOU HAD FOUND OUT YOU DIDN'T WANT ME
lbi-4323-55228-0018 DEMANDED BERTRAM ANGRY AND MYSTIFIED
lbi-4323-55228-0019 AS FOR MY NOT PAINTING AGAIN YOU DIDN'T UNDERSTAND PETE DEARIE
lbi-4323-55228-0020 SHE PULLED HERSELF HALF AWAY FROM BERTRAM'S ENCIRCLING ARM
lbi-4323-55228-0021 BILLY DREW A QUIVERING SIGH
lbi-4323-55228-0022 GOOD HEAVENS IS KATE IN THIS TOO BERTRAM'S VOICE WAS SAVAGE NOW
lbi-4323-55228-0023 WELL SHE WROTE A LETTER
lbi-4323-55228-0024 BILLY LAUGHED GAYLY BUT SHE SHIFTED HER POSITION AND DID NOT MEET HER LOVER'S EYES
lbi-4323-55228-0025 AND YOU NEVER DID THINK FOR A MINUTE BILLY THAT YOU CARED FOR HIM
lbi-4323-55228-0026 HE HAD NOT BEEN SLOW TO MARK THAT SWIFT LOWERING OF HER EYELIDS
lbi-4323-55228-0027 BILLY WAS SO GLAD BERTRAM HAD TURNED THE QUESTION ON HER LOVE INSTEAD OF ARKWRIGHT'S
lbi-4323-55228-0028 AFTER A MINUTE BILLY STIRRED AND SIGHED HAPPILY
lbi-4323-55228-0029 YOU SEE I WASN'T IN LOVE WITH MISTER ARKWRIGHT
lbi-4323-55228-0030 AND AND YOU DIDN'T CARE SPECIALLY FOR FOR MISS WINTHROP
lbi-4323-55228-0031 BILLY PUT A SOFT FINGER ON HIS LIPS
lbi-4323-55228-0032 BERTRAM KISSED THE FINGER AND SUBSIDED HUMPH HE COMMENTED
lbi-4323-55228-0033 WELL WHAT IS THAT IS THAT KATE TOO DEMANDED BERTRAM GRIMLY
lbi-4323-55228-0034 THERE WAS ANOTHER SILENCE THEN SUDDENLY BERTRAM STIRRED
lbi-4323-55228-0035 BILLY I'M GOING TO MARRY YOU TO MORROW HE ANNOUNCED DECISIVELY
lbi-4323-55228-0036 I DON'T KNOW AS I CAN TRUST YOU OUT OF MY SIGHT TILL THEN YOU'LL READ SOMETHING OR HEAR SOMETHING OR GET A LETTER FROM KATE AFTER BREAKFAST TO MORROW MORNING THAT WILL SET YOU SAVING ME AGAIN AND I DON'T WANT TO BE SAVED THAT WAY
lbi-4323-55228-0037 I'M GOING TO MARRY YOU TO MORROW I'LL GET HE STOPPED SHORT WITH A SUDDEN FROWN CONFOUND THAT LAW I FORGOT
lbi-4323-55228-0038 FIVE DAYS INDEED SIR
lbi-4323-55228-0039 I WONDER IF YOU THINK I CAN GET READY TO BE MARRIED IN FIVE DAYS
lbi-4323-55228-0040 DON'T WANT YOU TO GET READY RETORTED BERTRAM PROMPTLY I SAW MARIE GET READY AND I HAD ALL I WANTED OF IT
lbi-4323-55228-0041 IF YOU REALLY MUST HAVE ALL THOSE MILES OF TABLECLOTHS AND NAPKINS AND DOILIES AND LACE RUFFLINGS WE'LL DO IT AFTERWARDS NOT BEFORE BUT
lbi-4323-55228-0042 BESIDES I NEED YOU TO TAKE CARE OF ME CUT IN BERTRAM CRAFTILY
lbi-4323-55228-0043 THE TENDER GLOW ON BILLY'S FACE TOLD ITS OWN STORY AND BERTRAM'S EAGER EYES WERE NOT SLOW TO READ IT
lbi-4323-55228-0044 SWEETHEART SEE HERE DEAR HE CRIED SOFTLY TIGHTENING HIS GOOD LEFT ARM
lbi-4323-55228-0045 BILLY MY DEAR
lbi-4323-55228-0046 IT WAS AUNT HANNAH'S PLAINTIVE VOICE AT THE DOORWAY A LITTLE LATER
lbi-4323-55228-0047 WE MUST GO HOME AND WILLIAM IS HERE TOO AND WANTS TO SEE YOU
lbi-4323-55228-0048 YOU MEAN IT'LL BE BEFORE OCTOBER
lbi-4323-55228-0049 AUNT HANNAH GLANCED FROM ONE TO THE OTHER UNCERTAINLY
lbi-4323-55228-0050 YES NODDED BILLY DEMURELY
lbi-4323-55228-0051 YES I KNOW THAT IS A GOOD WHILE CUT IN BERTRAM AIRILY
lbi-4323-55228-0052 WE WANTED IT TO MORROW BUT WE HAD TO WAIT ON ACCOUNT OF THE NEW LICENSE LAW
lbi-4515-11057-0000 YET SO STRONG WAS THE EFFECT UPON HIM OF CONTEMPLATING A LARGE FORTUNE THAT IN DESPITE OF REASON AND DESIRE HE LIVED IN EAGER EXPECTATION OF THE WORD WHICH SHOULD MAKE HIM RICH
lbi-4515-11057-0001 A PART OF THAT IMPRESSION WAS DUE TO THE ENGAGEMENT WHICH HE MUST NOW FULFIL
lbi-4515-11057-0002 TO SHUFFLE OUT OF THIS DUTY WOULD MAKE HIM TOO IGNOBLE EVEN IN HIS OWN EYES
lbi-4515-11057-0003 BECAUSE IN HIS SALAD DAYS HE DALLIED WITH A GIRL WHO HAD INDEED MANY CHARMS STEP BY STEP HE HAD COME TO THE NECESSITY OF SACRIFICING HIS PROSPECTS TO THAT RAW ATTACHMENT
lbi-4515-11057-0004 UNABLE TO THINK OF WORK HE LEFT THE HOUSE AND WANDERED GLOOMILY ABOUT REGENT'S PARK
lbi-4515-11057-0005 HE FELT HIMSELF ILL USED BY DESTINY AND THEREFORE BY MARIAN WHO WAS FATE'S INSTRUMENT
lbi-4515-11057-0006 HE WROTE TO MARIAN
lbi-4515-11057-0007 WILL YOU LET ME HEAR OR COME AND SEE ME
lbi-4515-11057-0008 I SCARCELY THOUGHT OF BIFFEN AS LIKELY TO KILL HIMSELF
lbi-4515-11057-0009 BUT WHY THE DEUCE DID HE GO ALL THE WAY OUT THERE
lbi-4515-11057-0010 I HOPED YOU WOULD BRING ME SOME NEWS
lbi-4515-11057-0011 POVERTY I CAN ONLY SUPPOSE
lbi-4515-11057-0012 BUT I WILL SEE WHELPDALE I HADN'T COME ACROSS BIFFEN FOR A LONG TIME
lbi-4515-11057-0013 WAS HE STILL SO VERY POOR
lbi-4515-11057-0014 ASKED AMY COMPASSIONATELY
lbi-4515-11057-0015 I'M AFRAID SO HIS BOOK FAILED UTTERLY
lbi-4515-11057-0016 OH IF I HAD IMAGINED HIM STILL IN SUCH DISTRESS SURELY I MIGHT HAVE DONE SOMETHING TO HELP HIM
lbi-4515-11057-0017 PERCHANCE HIS DEATH WAS IN PART ATTRIBUTABLE TO THAT HOPELESS LOVE
lbi-4515-11057-0018 HE SENT ME A COPY OF HIS NOVEL SHE SAID AND I SAW HIM ONCE OR TWICE AFTER THAT
lbi-4515-11057-0019 HAVING THIS SUBJECT TO CONVERSE UPON PUT THE TWO MORE QUICKLY AT EASE THAN COULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN THE CASE
lbi-4515-11057-0020 AMY MIGHT TAKE A FOREMOST PLACE AMONG BRILLIANT WOMEN
lbi-4515-11057-0021 ESPECIALLY NOW THAT HER FATHER IS THREATENED WITH BLINDNESS
lbi-4515-11057-0022 IS IT SO SERIOUS
lbi-4515-11057-0023 EVEN IF MISTER YULE RECOVERS HIS SIGHT IT IS NOT AT ALL LIKELY THAT HE WILL BE ABLE TO WORK AS BEFORE
lbi-4515-11057-0024 OUR DIFFICULTIES ARE SO GRAVE THAT
lbi-4515-11057-0025 HE PAUSED AND LET HIS HAND FAIL DESPONDENTLY
lbi-4515-11057-0026 I HAVE A GOOD DEAL OF WILL YOU REMEMBER AND WHAT I HAVE SET MY MIND UPON NO DOUBT I SHALL SOME DAY ACHIEVE
lbi-4515-11057-0027 THERE WAS SILENCE
lbi-4515-11057-0028 THE LAST THREE YEARS HE CONTINUED HAVE MADE NO SLIGHT DIFFERENCE IN MY POSITION
lbi-4515-11057-0029 RECALL WHERE I STOOD WHEN YOU FIRST KNEW ME
lbi-4515-11057-0030 JUST NOW I AM IN NEED OF A LITTLE ENCOURAGEMENT
lbi-4515-11057-0031 YOU DON'T NOTICE ANY FALLING OFF IN MY WORK RECENTLY
lbi-4515-11057-0032 DO YOU SEE MY THINGS IN THE CURRENT AND SO ON GENERALLY
lbi-4515-11057-0033 SOMETIMES I BELIEVE I HAVE DETECTED YOU WHEN THERE WAS NO SIGNATURE
lbi-4515-11057-0034 HER STORY IN THAT GIRLS PAPER HAS ATTRACTED ATTENTION
lbi-4515-11057-0035 AND I COULD SO EASILY PUT HER AT REST BY RENOUNCING ALL CLAIM UPON HER
lbi-4515-11057-0036 I SURMISE THAT THAT YOU YOURSELF WOULD ALSO BE PUT AT REST BY SUCH A DECISION
lbi-4515-11057-0037 DON'T LOOK AT ME WITH THAT IRONICAL SMILE HE PLEADED
lbi-4515-11057-0038 I COULDN'T GO ABOUT DECLARING THAT I WAS HEARTBROKEN IN ANY EVENT I MUST BE CONTENT FOR PEOPLE TO JUDGE ME ACCORDING TO THEIR DISPOSITION AND JUDGMENTS ARE PRETTY SURE TO BE UNFAVOURABLE WHAT CAN I DO
lbi-4515-11057-0039 THE CASE IS TOO DELICATE I FEAR FOR MY ADVICE
lbi-4515-11057-0040 WELL I'LL GO BACK TO MY SCRIBBLING
lbi-4515-11057-0041 AGAIN JASPER HELD THE WHITE SOFT HAND FOR A SUPERFLUOUS MOMENT
lbi-4515-11057-0042 YET FOR SUCH FEELINGS HE REPROACHED HIMSELF AND THE REPROACH MADE HIM ANGRY
lbi-4515-11057-0043 MARIAN COULD NOT MISTAKE THE AIR OF RESTLESS TROUBLE ON HER COMPANION'S SMOOTH COUNTENANCE
lbi-4515-11057-0044 SHE HAD DIVINED THAT THERE WAS SOME GRAVE REASON FOR THIS SUMMONS AND THE PANTING WITH WHICH SHE HAD APPROACHED WAS HALF CAUSED BY THE ANXIOUS BEATS OF HER HEART
lbi-4515-11057-0045 HE BEGAN ABRUPTLY
lbi-4515-11057-0046 HE GAVE HER SUCH DETAILS AS HE HAD OBTAINED THEN ADDED
lbi-4515-11057-0047 THERE ARE TWO OF MY COMPANIONS FALLEN IN THE BATTLE
lbi-4515-11057-0048 I OUGHT TO THINK MYSELF A LUCKY FELLOW MARIAN WHAT
lbi-4515-11057-0049 YOU ARE BETTER FITTED TO FIGHT YOUR WAY JASPER
lbi-4515-11057-0050 MORE OF A BRUTE YOU MEAN
lbi-4515-11057-0051 YOU KNOW VERY WELL I DON'T
lbi-4515-11057-0052 I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND ABOUT OUR AFFAIRS HE WENT ON PRESENTLY
lbi-4515-11057-0053 YES
lbi-4515-11057-0054 WILL YOU MARRY ME AND LET US TAKE OUR CHANCE
lbi-4515-11057-0055 YOU FEEL YOURSELF INDISPENSABLE TO YOUR FATHER AT PRESENT
lbi-4515-11057-0056 I SHOULD BE SO AFRAID OF THE EFFECT UPON HIS HEALTH JASPER
lbi-4515-11057-0057 SHE PAUSED AND LOOKED UP AT HIM TOUCHINGLY
lbi-4515-11057-0058 DEAR I CAN'T FEEL IT WOULD BE MY DUTY TO RENOUNCE YOU BECAUSE MY FATHER HAD BECOME BLIND
lbi-4515-11057-0059 HAS ONE THING OCCURRED TO YOU
lbi-4515-11057-0060 WILL HE CONSENT TO RECEIVE AN ALLOWANCE FROM A PERSON WHOSE NAME IS MISSUS MILVAIN
lbi-4515-11057-0061 AND IF HE OBSTINATELY REFUSES WHAT THEN WHAT IS BEFORE HIM
lbi-4515-11057-0062 SHE LISTENED ANXIOUSLY AND REFLECTED
lbi-4515-11057-0063 AS I HAVE SAID THERE IS THE VERY SERIOUS DOUBT WHETHER YOUR FATHER WOULD ACCEPT MONEY FROM YOU WHEN YOU ARE MY WIFE
lbi-4515-11057-0064 IT ISN'T YOUR FAULT MARIAN AND WELL THEN THERE'S ONLY ONE THING TO DO
lbi-4515-11057-0065 EXCEPT JASPER THAT IF FATHER IS HELPLESS I MUST FIND MEANS OF ASSURING HIS SUPPORT
lbi-4515-11057-0066 DO YOU THINK THEM INSURMOUNTABLE
lbi-4515-11057-0067 THAT IS JUST WHAT I HAVE DECIDED IS IMPOSSIBLE MARIAN YOU SHALL HAVE THE PLAIN TRUTH
lbi-4515-11057-0068 I DON'T TRUST MYSELF
lbi-4515-11057-0069 BUT SHALL YOU FACE THEM WILLINGLY
lbi-4515-11057-0070 PUT UP YOUR UMBRELLA MARIAN
lbi-4515-11057-0071 WHAT DO I CARE FOR A DROP OF RAIN SHE EXCLAIMED WITH PASSIONATE SADNESS WHEN ALL MY LIFE IS AT STAKE HOW AM I TO UNDERSTAND YOU
lbi-4515-11057-0072 EVERY WORD YOU SPEAK SEEMS INTENDED TO DISHEARTEN ME
lbi-4515-11057-0073 WHY NEED YOU CONCEAL IT IF THAT IS THE TRUTH
lbi-4515-11057-0074 IS THAT WHAT YOU MEAN BY SAYING YOU DISTRUST YOURSELF
lbi-4515-11057-0075 WE MUST SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN MARIAN
lbi-4515-11057-0076 HOW AM I TO LIVE AN HOUR IN SUCH UNCERTAINTY AS THIS
lbi-4515-11057-0077 I DO WISH IT
lbi-4515-11057-0078 HER EMOTION HAD AN EFFECT UPON HIM AND HIS VOICE TREMBLED
lbi-4515-11057-0079 THERE IS NO NATURAL LAW THAT A CHILD SHOULD SURRENDER EVERYTHING FOR HER PARENTS
lbi-4515-11057-0080 YOU KNOW SO MUCH MORE OF THE WORLD THAN I DO CAN'T YOU ADVISE ME
lbi-4515-11057-0081 IS THERE NO WAY OF PROVIDING FOR MY FATHER
lbi-4515-11057-0082 GOOD GOD THIS IS FRIGHTFUL MARIAN I CAN'T STAND IT
lbi-4515-11057-0083 I WILL BE FAITHFUL TO YOU
lbi-4515-11057-0084 HE HAD MADE A PRETENCE OF HOLDING HIS UMBRELLA OVER HER BUT MARIAN TURNED AWAY AND WALKED TO A LITTLE DISTANCE AND STOOD BENEATH THE SHELTER OF A GREAT TREE HER FACE AVERTED FROM HIM
lbi-4515-11057-0085 MOVING TO FOLLOW HE SAW THAT HER FRAME WAS SHAKEN BY SOUNDLESS SOBBING
lbi-4515-11057-0086 IN WHAT CAN THERE BE MORE SELFISHNESS
lbi-4515-11057-0087 BUT I COULDN'T SAY A WORD THAT WOULD SEEM TO INVITE SUCH MISERY AS THIS
lbi-4515-11057-0088 YOU DON'T LOVE ME JASPER AND THAT'S AN END OF EVERYTHING
lbi-4515-11057-0089 HAPPINESS OR MISERY COME TO US BY FATE
lbi-4515-11057-0090 IS IT IN MY POWER TO MAKE YOU HAPPY
lbi-4515-11057-0091 BUT IF YOU HAD SAID YOU LOVED ME BEFORE THAT I SHOULD HAVE IT ALWAYS TO REMEMBER
lbi-4515-11057-0092 IF I BELIEVE ANYTHING I BELIEVE THAT I DID LOVE YOU
lbi-4515-11057-0093 WHAT CAN YOU SAY TO ME MORE THAN YOU HAVE SAID NOW
lbi-4515-11057-0094 REMEMBER ME AS A MAN WHO DISREGARDED PRICELESS LOVE SUCH AS YOURS TO GO AND MAKE HIMSELF A PROUD POSITION AMONG FOOLS AND KNAVES INDEED THAT'S WHAT IT COMES TO
lbi-4515-11057-0095 SOON ENOUGH YOU WOULD THOROUGHLY DESPISE ME AND THOUGH I SHOULD KNOW IT WAS MERITED MY PERVERSE PRIDE WOULD REVOLT AGAINST IT
lbi-4515-11057-0096 WHAT CAN BE SIMPLER THAN THE TRUTH
lbi-4515-11057-0097 IT IS A THING THAT HAPPENS EVERY DAY EITHER IN MAN OR WOMAN AND ALL THAT HONOUR DEMANDS IS THE COURAGE TO CONFESS THE TRUTH
lbi-4515-11057-0098 MARIAN WILL YOU DO THIS WILL YOU LET OUR ENGAGEMENT LAST FOR ANOTHER SIX MONTHS BUT WITHOUT OUR MEETING DURING THAT TIME
lbi-4515-11057-0099 THAT SEEMS TO ME CHILDISH
lbi-4515-11057-0100 THE RAIN FELL UNCEASINGLY AND WITH IT BEGAN TO MINGLE AN AUTUMNAL MIST
lbi-4515-11057-0101 JASPER DELAYED A MOMENT THEN ASKED CALMLY
lbi-4515-11057-0102 ARE YOU GOING TO THE MUSEUM YES
lbi-4515-11057-0103 GO HOME AGAIN FOR THIS MORNING MARIAN YOU CAN'T WORK
lbi-4515-11057-0104 I MUST AND I HAVE NO TIME TO LOSE
lbi-4515-11057-0105 GOOD BYE SHE GAVE HIM HER HAND
lbi-4515-11057-0106 THEY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER FOR AN INSTANT THEN MARIAN LEFT THE SHELTER OF THE TREE OPENED HER UMBRELLA AND WALKED QUICKLY AWAY
lbi-4515-11057-0107 JASPER DID NOT WATCH HER HE HAD THE FACE OF A MAN WHO IS SUFFERING A SEVERE HUMILIATION
lbi-4515-11057-0108 HIS SISTER SAID VERY LITTLE FOR SHE RECOGNISED GENUINE SUFFERING IN HIS TONES AND ASPECT
lbi-4515-11057-0109 A FEW WEEKS AGO HE ACTUALLY PROPOSED TO A WOMAN FOR WHOM HE DOES NOT PRETEND TO HAVE THE SLIGHTEST AFFECTION BUT WHO IS VERY RICH AND WHO SEEMED LIKELY TO BE FOOLISH ENOUGH TO MARRY HIM
lbi-4515-11057-0110 YESTERDAY MORNING HE RECEIVED HER FINAL ANSWER A REFUSAL
lbi-4515-11057-0111 YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THOUGH SURELY YOU NEED NO FRESH PROOF HOW UTTERLY UNWORTHY HE IS OF YOU
lbi-4515-11057-0112 YOU ARE THE ONLY FRIEND I HAVE OF MY OWN SEX AND I COULD NOT BEAR TO LOSE YOU
lbi-4515-11057-0113 SEVERAL DAYS PASSED BEFORE THERE CAME A REPLY
lbi-4515-11057-0114 I MUST ONLY ASK THAT YOU WILL WRITE TO ME WITHOUT THE LEAST REFERENCE TO THESE TROUBLES TELL ME ALWAYS ABOUT YOURSELF AND BE SURE THAT YOU CANNOT TELL ME TOO MUCH
lbi-4570-102353-0000 WE HAD THEN BUT LITTLE OF THAT MINUTE AND ACCURATE KNOWLEDGE OF THE INTERIOR OF THE CONTINENT WHICH WAS REQUISITE FOR A DETERMINATION OF THE PROBLEM
lbi-4570-102353-0001 SEVERAL DIFFERENT PARTIES WERE THEREFORE ORGANIZED TO EXAMINE THE VARIOUS ROUTES SUPPOSED TO BE PRACTICABLE WITHIN THE NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN LIMITS OF THE UNITED STATES
lbi-4570-102353-0002 THE ONLY DISCRIMINATION MADE WAS IN THE MORE PROMPT AND THOROUGH EQUIPMENT OF THE PARTIES FOR THE EXTREME NORTHERN LINE AND THIS WAS ONLY BECAUSE THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE MOST DIFFICULT OF EXECUTION OF ALL THE SURVEYS
lbi-4570-102353-0003 INQUIRIES WERE MADE WITH REGARD TO GUNPOWDER WHICH SUBSEQUENTLY LED TO THE USE OF A COARSER GRAIN FOR ARTILLERY
lbi-4570-102353-0004 THE OFFICERS OF THESE REGIMENTS WERE CHOSEN PARTLY BY SELECTION FROM THOSE ALREADY IN SERVICE IN THE REGULAR ARMY AND PARTLY BY APPOINTMENT FROM CIVIL LIFE
lbi-4570-102353-0005 UNDER INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE PRESIDENT THE LIST WAS THEREFORE REVISED AND MODIFIED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS NEW ELEMENT OF GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION
lbi-4570-102353-0006 AFTER SOME FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE QUESTION THE VISITORS WITHDREW DISSATISFIED WITH THE RESULT OF THE INTERVIEW
lbi-4570-102353-0007 THE QUARTERMASTER GENERAL ON HEARING OF THIS CONVERSATION HASTENED TO INFORM ME THAT IT WAS ALL A MISTAKE THAT THE APPOINTEE TO THE OFFICE HAD BEEN CONFOUNDED WITH HIS FATHER WHO WAS A WELL KNOWN WHIG BUT THAT HE THE SON WAS A DEMOCRAT
lbi-4570-102353-0008 I ASSURED THE GENERAL THAT THIS WAS ALTOGETHER IMMATERIAL ADDING THAT IT WAS A VERY PRETTY QUARREL AS IT STOOD AND THAT I HAD NO DESIRE TO EFFECT A SETTLEMENT OF IT ON ANY INFERIOR ISSUE
lbi-4570-14911-0000 NEVERTHELESS IN GENERAL APPEARANCE THE HARRIER AND THE FOXHOUND ARE VERY MUCH ALIKE THE ONE OBVIOUS DISTINCTION BEING THAT OF SIZE
lbi-4570-14911-0001 IF YOU WANT TO HUNT YOUR HARRIERS ON FOOT SIXTEEN INCHES IS QUITE BIG ENOUGH ALMOST TOO BIG TO RUN WITH BUT IF YOU ARE RIDING TO THEM TWENTY INCHES IS A USEFUL HEIGHT OR EVEN NINETEEN INCHES
lbi-4570-14911-0002 IT IS USELESS TO LAY DOWN ANY HARD AND FAST RULE AS TO COLOUR IT IS SO MUCH A MATTER OF INDIVIDUAL TASTE
lbi-4570-14911-0003 BUT PUPPIES ARE USUALLY SENT OUT TO WALK AND MAY EASILY BE PROCURED TO BE KEPT AND REARED UNTIL THEY ARE OLD ENOUGH TO BE ENTERED TO THEIR WORK
lbi-4570-14911-0004 HE IS OF COURSE FINER BUT WITH THE LENGTH OF NECK SO PERFECT IN THE BIGGER HOUND THE LITTLE SHOULDERS OF THE SAME PATTERN AND THE TYPICAL QUARTERS AND SECOND THIGHS
lbi-4570-14911-0005 AND WHEN HE IS FAIRLY ON A LINE OF COURSE HE STICKS TO IT AS THE SAYING IS LIKE A BEAGLE
lbi-4570-14911-0006 IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THEREFORE THAT THE BEAGLE WAS CROSSED WITH THE WELSH SOUTHERN OR OTTERHOUND TO GET MORE SIZE AND POWER AS THERE CERTAINLY WAS A WELSH ROUGH COATED BEAGLE OF GOOD EIGHTEEN INCHES AND AN ALMOST IDENTICAL CONTEMPORARY THAT WAS CALLED THE ESSEX BEAGLE
lbi-4570-14911-0007 THAT A GREAT MANY OF THE TRUE ORDER WERE BRED BECAME VERY MANIFEST AS SOON AS THE HARRIER AND BEAGLE ASSOCIATION WAS FORMED AND MORE PARTICULARLY WHEN A SECTION OF THE PETERBOROUGH HOUND SHOW WAS RESERVED FOR THEM
lbi-4570-14911-0008 THEN THEY SEEMED TO SPRING FROM EVERY PART OF THE COUNTRY
lbi-4570-14911-0009 ONE HEARS NOW OF THE CHAUSTON THE HALSTEAD PLACE VERY NOTED INDEED THE HULTON THE LEIGH PARK THE STOKE PLACE THE EDINBURGH THE SURBITON THE TRINITY FOOT THE WOODDALE MISSUS G W HILLIARD'S MISSUS PRICE'S AND MISSUS TURNER'S
lbi-4570-14911-0010 EYES BROWN DARK HAZEL OR HAZEL NOT DEEP SET NOR BULGY AND WITH A MILD EXPRESSION
lbi-4570-14911-0011 EARS LONG SET ON LOW FINE IN TEXTURE AND HANGING IN A GRACEFUL FOLD CLOSE TO THE CHEEK
lbi-4570-14911-0012 NECK MODERATELY LONG SLIGHTLY ARCHED THE THROAT SHOWING SOME DEWLAP
lbi-4570-14911-0013 SHOULDERS CLEAN AND SLIGHTLY SLOPING
lbi-4570-14911-0014 FORE LEGS QUITE STRAIGHT WELL UNDER THE DOG OF GOOD SUBSTANCE AND ROUND IN THE BONE
lbi-4570-14911-0015 FEET ROUND WELL KNUCKLED UP AND STRONGLY PADDED
lbi-4570-14911-0016 COAT SMOOTH VARIETY SMOOTH VERY DENSE AND NOT TOO FINE OR SHORT
lbi-4570-14911-0017 HEIGHT NOT EXCEEDING SIXTEEN INCHES
lbi-4570-24733-0000 ALL THINGS WHICH FOLLOW FROM THE ABSOLUTE NATURE OF ANY ATTRIBUTE OF GOD MUST ALWAYS EXIST AND BE INFINITE OR IN OTHER WORDS ARE ETERNAL AND INFINITE THROUGH THE SAID ATTRIBUTE
lbi-4570-24733-0001 PROOF CONCEIVE IF IT BE POSSIBLE SUPPOSING THE PROPOSITION TO BE DENIED THAT SOMETHING IN SOME ATTRIBUTE OF GOD CAN FOLLOW FROM THE ABSOLUTE NATURE OF THE SAID ATTRIBUTE AND THAT AT THE SAME TIME IT IS FINITE AND HAS A CONDITIONED EXISTENCE OR DURATION FOR INSTANCE THE IDEA OF GOD EXPRESSED IN THE ATTRIBUTE THOUGHT
lbi-4570-24733-0002 IN ITS NATURE INFINITE
lbi-4570-24733-0003 MUST NECESSARILY EXIST
lbi-4570-24733-0004 WE HAVE NOW GRANTED THEREFORE THOUGHT NOT CONSTITUTING THE IDEA OF GOD AND ACCORDINGLY THE IDEA OF GOD DOES NOT NATURALLY FOLLOW FROM ITS NATURE IN SO FAR AS IT IS ABSOLUTE THOUGHT FOR IT IS CONCEIVED AS CONSTITUTING AND ALSO AS NOT CONSTITUTING THE IDEA OF GOD WHICH IS AGAINST OUR HYPOTHESIS
lbi-4570-24733-0005 AND BEYOND THE LIMITS OF THE DURATION OF THE IDEA OF GOD SUPPOSING THE LATTER AT SOME TIME NOT TO HAVE EXISTED OR NOT TO BE GOING TO EXIST THOUGHT WOULD PERFORCE HAVE EXISTED WITHOUT THE IDEA OF GOD WHICH IS CONTRARY TO OUR HYPOTHESIS FOR WE SUPPOSED THAT THOUGHT BEING GIVEN THE IDEA OF GOD NECESSARILY FLOWED THEREFROM
lbi-4570-24733-0006 BEAR IN MIND THAT THE SAME PROPOSITION MAY BE AFFIRMED OF ANYTHING WHICH IN ANY ATTRIBUTE NECESSARILY FOLLOWS FROM GOD'S ABSOLUTE NATURE
lbi-4570-24733-0007 COROLLARY HENCE IT FOLLOWS THAT GOD IS NOT ONLY THE CAUSE OF THINGS COMING INTO EXISTENCE BUT ALSO OF THEIR CONTINUING IN EXISTENCE THAT IS IN SCHOLASTIC PHRASEOLOGY GOD IS CAUSE OF THE BEING OF THINGS ESSENDI RERUM
lbi-4570-24733-0008 COROLLARY INDIVIDUAL THINGS ARE NOTHING BUT MODIFICATIONS OF THE ATTRIBUTES OF GOD OR MODES BY WHICH THE ATTRIBUTES OF GOD ARE EXPRESSED IN A FIXED AND DEFINITE MANNER
lbi-4570-56594-0000 SUCH A CORPS SUCH A TIME YOU NEVER DID SEE
lbi-4570-56594-0001 I WAS WISHING SOMEBODY WOULD GIVE THE CONVERSATION A START WHEN INDIANY MADE A BREAK
lbi-4570-56594-0002 THIS AIN'T NO GREAT STOCK COUNTRY SAYS HE TO THE OLD GENTLEMAN WITH THE CANE
lbi-4570-56594-0003 NO SIR SAYS THE OLD GENTLEMAN
lbi-4570-56594-0004 THERE'S VERY LITTLE GRAZING HERE AND THE RANGE IS PRETTY MUCH WORE OUT
lbi-4570-56594-0005 THE YOUNG LADY SMILED THROUGH HER VEIL AND THE OLD LADY SNAPPED HER EYES AND LOOKED SIDEWAYS AT THE SPEAKER
lbi-4570-56594-0006 I'M GWINE DOWN TO ORLEANS TO SEE IF I CAN'T GIT A CONTRACT OUT OF UNCLE SAM TO FEED THE BOYS WHAT'S BEEN LICKIN THEM INFERNAL MEXICANS SO BAD
lbi-4570-56594-0007 I'VE READ SOME ACCOUNTS OF THE BATTLE SAYS THE OLD GENTLEMAN THAT DIDN'T GIVE A VERY FLATTERING ACCOUNT OF THE CONDUCT OF SOME OF OUR TROOPS
lbi-4570-56594-0008 THE OLD PREACHER LISTENED TO HIM WITH EVIDENT SIGNS OF DISPLEASURE TWISTIN AND GROANIN TILL HE COULDN'T STAND IT NO LONGER
lbi-4570-56594-0009 HE SHUT HIS MOUTH RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF WHAT HE WAS SAYIN AND LOOKED AT THE PREACHER WHILE HIS FACE GOT AS RED AS FIRE
lbi-4570-56594-0010 SWEARIN SAYS THE OLD PREACHER IS A TERRIBLE BAD PRACTICE AND THERE AIN'T NO USE IN IT NOHOW
lbi-4570-56594-0011 UMPHS BUT INDIANY KEPT SHADY HE APPEARED TO BE COWED DOWN
lbi-4570-56594-0012 THE OLD GENTLEMAN WITH THE CANE TOOK A PART IN THE CONVERSATION AND THE HOOSIER LISTENED WITHOUT EVER OPENING HIS HEAD
lbi-4570-56594-0013 HE WAS AT SODOM AND GOMORROW AND SEEN THE PLACE WHAR LOT'S WIFE FELL AH

lbi-4831-25894-0011 IT WAS RATHER A DIRTY HAND BUT SO KIND THAT TESSA CLUNG TO IT AND KEPT LOOKING UP AT THE FRIENDLY BROWN FACE FOR ENCOURAGEMENT

lbi-4831-25894-0016 HER HANDS WERE COVERED WITH CHILBLAINS FOR SHE HAD NO MITTENS BUT SHE PUT THEM UNDER HER SHAWL AND SCUFFLED MERRILY AWAY IN HER BIG BOOTS FEELING SO GLAD THAT THE WEEK WAS OVER AND NEARLY THREE DOLLARS SAFE IN HER POCKET
lbi-4831-25894-0017 HOW GAY THE STREETS WERE THAT DAY
lbi-4831-25894-0018 HOW BRISK EVERY ONE WAS AND HOW BRIGHT THE FACES LOOKED AS PEOPLE TROTTED ABOUT WITH BIG BASKETS HOLLY WREATHS AND YOUNG EVERGREENS GOING TO BLOSSOM INTO SPLENDID CHRISTMAS TREES
lbi-4831-25894-0019 BUT I CAN'T SO I'LL FILL THE SOCKS ALL FULL AND BE HAPPY SAID TESSA AS SHE LOOKED WISTFULLY INTO THE GAY STORES AND SAW THE HEAVY BASKETS GO BY

lbi-4831-25894-0022 AT THE FOURTH SOME PEOPLE LET THEM SING ALL THEIR SONGS AND GAVE NOTHING
lbi-4831-25894-0023 TESSA FELT SO GRATEFUL THAT WITHOUT WAITING FOR TOMMO SHE SANG HER SWEETEST LITTLE SONG ALL ALONE
lbi-4831-25894-0024 I'LL ASK MAMMA SAID ROSE AND AWAY SHE WENT INTO THE DINING ROOM CLOSE BY
lbi-4831-25894-0025 AS THE DOOR OPENED TESSA SAW WHAT LOOKED TO HER LIKE A FAIRY FEAST ALL SILVER MUGS AND FLOWERY PLATES AND ORANGES AND NUTS AND ROSY WINE IN TALL GLASS PITCHERS AND SMOKING DISHES THAT SMELT SO DELICIOUSLY SHE COULD NOT RESTRAIN A LITTLE SNIFF OF SATISFACTION
lbi-4831-25894-0026 AH YES I SHALL COME WITH MUCH GLADNESS AND PLAY AS NEVER IN MY LIFE BEFORE CRIED TOMMO WITH A FLOURISH OF THE OLD CAP THAT MADE THE CHILDREN LAUGH

lbi-4831-25894-0028 AH SO KIND SO VERY KIND I HAVE NO WAY TO SAY THANK YOU BUT RANZA SHALL BE FOR YOU A HEAVENLY ANGEL AND I WILL SING MY HEART OUT FOR YOUR TREE CRIED TESSA FOLDING THE MITTENS AS IF SHE WOULD SAY A PRAYER OF THANKFULNESS IF SHE KNEW HOW
lbi-4831-25894-0029 SHE GOT UP EARLY TO SEE IF THE SOCKS WERE ALL RIGHT AND THERE SHE FOUND THE MOST ASTONISHING SIGHT
lbi-4831-25894-0030 FOUR SOCKS INSTEAD OF THREE AND BY THE FOURTH PINNED OUT QUITE ELEGANTLY WAS A LITTLE DRESS EVIDENTLY MEANT FOR HER A WARM WOOLLEN DRESS ALL MADE AND ACTUALLY WITH BRIGHT BUTTONS ON IT
lbi-4831-25894-0031 TESSA SCREAMED AND DANCED IN HER DELIGHT AND UP TUMBLED ALL THE CHILDREN TO SCREAM AND DANCE WITH HER MAKING A REGULAR CARNIVAL ON A SMALL SCALE
lbi-4831-25894-0032 IN HER LONG STOCKING SHE FOUND ALL SORTS OF TREASURES FOR TOMMO HAD STUFFED IT FULL OF QUEER THINGS AND HIS MOTHER HAD MADE GINGERBREAD INTO EVERY IMAGINABLE SHAPE FROM FAT PIGS TO FULL OMNIBUSES
lbi-4831-25894-0033 LITTLE RANZA WAS ACCEPTED WITH DELIGHT BY THE KIND LADY AND HER CHILDREN AND TESSA LEARNED THE SONG QUITE EASILY
lbi-4831-25894-0034 AROSE FROM THE CROWD OF CHILDREN GATHERED TO THE FESTIVAL
lbi-4831-25894-0035 BEFORE THEY WENT HOME THE KIND MAMMA TOLD TESSA SHE SHOULD BE HER FRIEND AND GAVE HER A MOTHERLY KISS WHICH WARMED THE CHILD'S HEART AND SEEMED TO SET A SEAL UPON THAT PROMISE
lbi-4831-29134-0000 THE SENATOR TOOK HIS SEAT IN THE PULPIT WITH THE MINISTER ON ONE SIDE OF HIM AND THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE SUNDAY SCHOOL ON THE OTHER
lbi-4831-29134-0001 SO AWED WERE THEY BY THE PRESENCE OF A LIVING UNITED STATES SENATOR THAT DURING THREE MINUTES NOT A SPIT BALL WAS THROWN
lbi-4831-29134-0002 AFTER THAT THEY BEGAN TO COME TO THEMSELVES BY DEGREES AND PRESENTLY THE SPELL WAS WHOLLY GONE AND THEY WERE RECITING VERSES AND PULLING HAIR
lbi-4831-29134-0003 THE USUAL SUNDAY SCHOOL EXERCISES WERE HURRIED THROUGH AND THEN THE MINISTER GOT UP AND BORED THE HOUSE WITH A SPEECH BUILT ON THE CUSTOMARY SUNDAY SCHOOL PLAN THEN THE SUPERINTENDENT PUT IN HIS OAR THEN THE TOWN DIGNITARIES HAD THEIR SAY
lbi-4831-29134-0004 AM I IN SOME POPULOUS CENTRE OF MY OWN COUNTRY WHERE THE CHOICEST CHILDREN OF THE LAND HAVE BEEN SELECTED AND BROUGHT TOGETHER AS AT A FAIR FOR A PRIZE NO
lbi-4831-29134-0005 THEN WHERE AM I YES WHERE AM I
lbi-4831-29134-0006 MY SOUL IS LOST IN WONDER AT THE THOUGHT
lbi-4831-29134-0007 EARTH HAS NO HIGHER NO GRANDER POSITION FOR ME
lbi-4831-29134-0008 THEN WHAT IS IT WHAT DID MY CONSCIOUSNESS REPLY
lbi-4831-29134-0009 AH THINK OF THAT NOW I COULD HARDLY KEEP THE TEARS BACK I WAS SO GRATEFUL
lbi-4831-29134-0010 THEY COULD NOT GIVE HIM A COSTLY EDUCATION BUT THEY WERE GOOD AND WISE AND THEY SENT HIM TO THE SUNDAY SCHOOL HE LOVED THE SUNDAY SCHOOL
lbi-4831-29134-0011 I HOPE YOU LOVE YOUR SUNDAY SCHOOL AH I SEE BY YOUR FACES THAT YOU DO THAT IS RIGHT
lbi-4831-29134-0012 ALWAYS LOVE YOUR TEACHERS MY CHILDREN FOR THEY LOVE YOU MORE THAN YOU CAN KNOW NOW
lbi-4831-29134-0013 AND BY AND BY THE PEOPLE MADE HIM GOVERNOR AND HE SAID IT WAS ALL OWING TO THE SUNDAY SCHOOL
lbi-4831-29134-0014 WHY THE PEOPLE GAVE HIM A TOWERING ILLUSTRIOUS POSITION A GRAND IMPOSING POSITION
lbi-4831-29134-0015 IT WAS SENATOR OF THE UNITED STATES
lbi-4831-29134-0016 THAT POOR LITTLE BOY THAT LOVED HIS SUNDAY SCHOOL BECAME THAT MAN THAT MAN STANDS BEFORE YOU
lbi-4831-29134-0017 ABOVE ALL THINGS MY CHILDREN BE HONEST
lbi-4831-29134-0018 WHEN SENATOR DILWORTHY DEPARTED FROM CATTLEVILLE HE LEFT THREE DOZEN BOYS BEHIND HIM ARRANGING A CAMPAIGN OF LIFE WHOSE OBJECTIVE POINT WAS THE UNITED STATES SENATE
lbi-5543-27761-0000 LELECHKA WAS A DELIGHTFUL CHILD
lbi-5543-27761-0001 THERE WAS NO OTHER SUCH CHILD THERE NEVER HAD BEEN AND THERE NEVER WOULD BE
lbi-5543-27761-0002 LELECHKA'S MOTHER SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA WAS SURE OF THAT
lbi-5543-27761-0003 LELECHKA'S EYES WERE DARK AND LARGE HER CHEEKS WERE ROSY HER LIPS WERE MADE FOR KISSES AND FOR LAUGHTER
lbi-5543-27761-0004 BUT IT WAS NOT THESE CHARMS IN LELECHKA THAT GAVE HER MOTHER THE KEENEST JOY
lbi-5543-27761-0005 SHE FELT COLD WITH HER HUSBAND
lbi-5543-27761-0006 HE WAS ALWAYS FRESH AND COOL WITH A FRIGID SMILE AND WHEREVER HE PASSED COLD CURRENTS SEEMED TO MOVE IN THE AIR
lbi-5543-27761-0007 IT EVEN SEEMED TO SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA THAT SHE WAS IN LOVE WITH HER FUTURE HUSBAND AND THIS MADE HER HAPPY
lbi-5543-27761-0008 THE BRIDE WAS ALSO GOOD LOOKING SHE WAS A TALL DARK EYED DARK HAIRED GIRL SOMEWHAT TIMID BUT VERY TACTFUL
lbi-5543-27761-0009 HE HAD CONNEXIONS AND HIS WIFE CAME OF GOOD INFLUENTIAL PEOPLE
lbi-5543-27761-0010 THIS MIGHT AT THE PROPER OPPORTUNITY PROVE USEFUL
lbi-5543-27761-0011 AFTER THEIR MARRIAGE THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE MANNER OF SERGEY MODESTOVICH TO SUGGEST ANYTHING WRONG TO HIS WIFE
lbi-5543-27761-0012 LATER HOWEVER WHEN HIS WIFE WAS ABOUT TO HAVE A CHILD SERGEY MODESTOVICH ESTABLISHED CONNEXIONS ELSEWHERE OF A LIGHT AND TEMPORARY NATURE
lbi-5543-27761-0013 SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA FOUND THIS OUT AND TO HER OWN ASTONISHMENT WAS NOT PARTICULARLY HURT SHE AWAITED HER INFANT WITH A RESTLESS ANTICIPATION THAT SWALLOWED EVERY OTHER FEELING
lbi-5543-27761-0014 SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA DRIFTED FARTHER AND FARTHER AWAY FROM HIM
lbi-5543-27761-0015 LELECHKA THEN RAN AWAY STAMPING WITH HER PLUMP LITTLE LEGS OVER THE CARPETS AND HID HERSELF BEHIND THE CURTAINS NEAR HER BED
lbi-5543-27761-0016 WHERE IS MY BABY GIRL THE MOTHER ASKED AS SHE LOOKED FOR LELECHKA AND MADE BELIEVE THAT SHE DID NOT SEE HER
lbi-5543-27761-0017 THEN SHE CAME OUT A LITTLE FARTHER AND HER MOTHER AS THOUGH SHE HAD ONLY JUST CAUGHT SIGHT OF HER SEIZED HER BY HER LITTLE SHOULDERS AND EXCLAIMED JOYOUSLY HERE SHE IS MY LELECHKA
lbi-5543-27761-0018 HER MOTHER'S EYES GLOWED WITH PASSIONATE EMOTION
lbi-5543-27761-0019 HER MOTHER WENT TO HIDE
lbi-5543-27761-0020 LELECHKA TURNED AWAY AS THOUGH NOT TO SEE BUT WATCHED HER MAMOCHKA STEALTHILY ALL THE TIME
lbi-5543-27761-0021 WHERE'S MY MAMOCHKA ASKED LELECHKA
lbi-5543-27761-0022 A SMILE OF ABSOLUTE BLISS PLAYED ON HER RED LIPS
lbi-5543-27761-0023 LELECHKA WAS GETTING NEARER HER MOTHER'S CORNER
lbi-5543-27761-0024 HER MOTHER WAS GROWING MORE ABSORBED EVERY MOMENT BY HER INTEREST IN THE GAME HER HEART BEAT WITH SHORT QUICK STROKES AND SHE PRESSED EVEN CLOSER TO THE WALL DISARRANGING HER HAIR STILL MORE
lbi-5543-27761-0025 LELECHKA SUDDENLY GLANCED TOWARD HER MOTHER'S CORNER AND SCREAMED WITH JOY
lbi-5543-27761-0026 THROUGH THE HALF CLOSED DOORS HE HEARD THE LAUGHTER THE JOYOUS OUTCRIES THE SOUND OF ROMPING
lbi-5543-27761-0027 EVEN FEDOSYA FELT ABASHED NOW FOR HER MISTRESS NOW FOR HERSELF
lbi-5543-27761-0028 HE LIKED COMING HERE WHERE EVERYTHING WAS BEAUTIFULLY ARRANGED THIS WAS DONE BY SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA WHO WISHED TO SURROUND HER LITTLE GIRL FROM HER VERY INFANCY ONLY WITH THE LOVELIEST THINGS
lbi-5543-27761-0029 SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA DRESSED HERSELF TASTEFULLY THIS TOO SHE DID FOR LELECHKA WITH THE SAME END IN VIEW
lbi-5543-27761-0030 ONE THING SERGEY MODESTOVICH HAD NOT BECOME RECONCILED TO AND THIS WAS HIS WIFE'S ALMOST CONTINUOUS PRESENCE IN THE NURSERY
lbi-5543-27761-0031 IT'S JUST AS I THOUGHT I KNEW THAT I'D FIND YOU HERE HE SAID WITH A DERISIVE AND CONDESCENDING SMILE
lbi-5543-27761-0032 MERELY YOU SEE THAT THE CHILD SHOULD FEEL ITS OWN INDIVIDUALITY HE EXPLAINED IN ANSWER TO SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA'S PUZZLED GLANCE
lbi-5543-27761-0033 SHE'S STILL SO LITTLE SAID SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA
lbi-5543-27761-0034 I DON'T INSIST IT'S YOUR KINGDOM THERE
lbi-5543-27761-0035 I'LL THINK IT OVER HIS WIFE ANSWERED SMILING AS HE DID COLDLY BUT GENIALLY
lbi-5543-27761-0036 THEN THEY BEGAN TO TALK OF SOMETHING ELSE
lbi-5543-27761-0037 THAT THE MISTRESS DOES IT WELL THAT'S ONE THING BUT THAT THE YOUNG LADY DOES IT THAT'S BAD
lbi-5543-27761-0038 WHY ASKED FEDOSYA WITH CURIOSITY
lbi-5543-27761-0039 THIS EXPRESSION OF CURIOSITY GAVE HER FACE THE LOOK OF A WOODEN ROUGHLY PAINTED DOLL
lbi-5543-27761-0040 YES THAT'S BAD REPEATED AGATHYA WITH CONVICTION TERRIBLY BAD WELL
lbi-5543-27761-0041 IT'S THE TRUTH I'M SAYING REMEMBER MY WORDS AGATHYA WENT ON WITH THE SAME ASSURANCE AND SECRECY
lbi-5543-27761-0042 IT'S THE SUREST SIGN
lbi-5543-27761-0043 THE OLD WOMAN HAD INVENTED THIS SIGN QUITE SUDDENLY HERSELF AND SHE WAS EVIDENTLY VERY PROUD OF IT
lbi-5543-27761-0044 MADAM MADAM SHE SAID QUIETLY IN A TREMBLING VOICE
lbi-5543-27761-0045 SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA GAVE A START
lbi-5543-27761-0046 FEDOSYA'S FACE MADE HER ANXIOUS
lbi-5543-27761-0047 WHAT IS IT FEDOSYA SHE ASKED WITH GREAT CONCERN IS THERE ANYTHING WRONG WITH LELECHKA
lbi-5543-27761-0048 NO MADAM SAID FEDOSYA AS SHE GESTICULATED WITH HER HANDS TO REASSURE HER MISTRESS AND TO MAKE HER SIT DOWN
lbi-5543-27761-0049 LELECHKA IS ASLEEP MAY GOD BE WITH HER
lbi-5543-27761-0050 ONLY I'D LIKE TO SAY SOMETHING YOU SEE LELECHKA IS ALWAYS HIDING HERSELF THAT'S NOT GOOD
lbi-5543-27761-0051 I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW BAD IT IS SAID FEDOSYA AND HER FACE EXPRESSED THE MOST DECIDED CONFIDENCE
lbi-5543-27761-0052 I UNDERSTAND NOTHING OF WHAT YOU ARE SAYING
lbi-5543-27761-0053 YOU SEE MADAM IT'S A KIND OF OMEN EXPLAINED FEDOSYA ABRUPTLY IN A SHAMEFACED WAY
lbi-5543-27761-0054 NONSENSE SAID SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA
lbi-5543-27761-0055 WHO TOLD YOU ALL THIS ASKED SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA IN AN AUSTERE LOW VOICE
lbi-5543-27761-0056 KNOWS EXCLAIMED SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA IN IRRITATION AS THOUGH SHE WISHED TO PROTECT HERSELF SOMEHOW FROM THIS SUDDEN ANXIETY
lbi-5543-27761-0057 WHAT NONSENSE AS THOUGH LELECHKA COULD DIE
lbi-5543-27761-0058 SHE SAW CLEARLY THAT THERE COULD BE NO POSSIBLE CONNEXION BETWEEN A CHILD'S QUITE ORDINARY DIVERSION AND THE CONTINUATION OF THE CHILD'S LIFE
lbi-5543-27761-0059 SHE MADE A SPECIAL EFFORT THAT EVENING TO OCCUPY HER MIND WITH OTHER MATTERS BUT HER THOUGHTS RETURNED INVOLUNTARILY TO THE FACT THAT LELECHKA LOVED TO HIDE HERSELF
lbi-5543-27761-0060 WHEN LELECHKA WAS STILL QUITE SMALL AND HAD LEARNED TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN HER MOTHER AND HER NURSE SHE SOMETIMES SITTING IN HER NURSE'S ARMS MADE A SUDDEN ROGUISH GRIMACE AND HID HER LAUGHING FACE IN THE NURSE'S SHOULDER
lbi-5543-27761-0061 THEN SHE WOULD LOOK OUT WITH A SLY GLANCE
lbi-5543-27761-0062 THOUGH SHE REPROACHED HERSELF AT ONCE FOR THIS UNFOUNDED SUPERSTITIOUS DREAD NEVERTHELESS SHE COULD NOT ENTER WHOLEHEARTEDLY INTO THE SPIRIT OF LELECHKA'S FAVOURITE GAME AND SHE TRIED TO DIVERT LELECHKA'S ATTENTION TO SOMETHING ELSE
lbi-5543-27761-0063 SHE EAGERLY COMPLIED WITH HER MOTHER'S NEW WISHES
lbi-5543-27761-0064 SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA TRIED DESPERATELY TO AMUSE LELECHKA
lbi-5543-27761-0065 PERHAPS THOUGHT SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA SHE IS NOT AS STRONGLY DRAWN TO THE WORLD AS OTHER CHILDREN WHO ARE ATTRACTED BY MANY THINGS
lbi-5543-27761-0066 IF THIS IS SO IS IT NOT A SIGN OF ORGANIC WEAKNESS
lbi-5543-27761-0067 SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA HERSELF BEGAN THE GAME ONCE OR TWICE THOUGH SHE PLAYED IT WITH A HEAVY HEART
lbi-5543-27761-0068 SHE SUFFERED AS THOUGH COMMITTING AN EVIL DEED WITH FULL CONSCIOUSNESS
lbi-5543-27761-0069 IT WAS A SAD DAY FOR SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA
lbi-5543-27761-0070 HER MOTHER COVERED HER WITH A BLUE BLANKET
lbi-5543-27761-0071 LELECHKA DREW HER SWEET LITTLE HANDS FROM UNDER THE BLANKET AND STRETCHED THEM OUT TO EMBRACE HER MOTHER HER MOTHER BENT DOWN
lbi-5543-27761-0072 SHE SEEMED SO SMALL AND SO FRAIL UNDER THE BLANKET THAT COVERED HER
lbi-5543-27761-0073 SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA REMAINED STANDING OVER LELECHKA'S BED A LONG WHILE AND SHE KEPT LOOKING AT LELECHKA WITH TENDERNESS AND FEAR
lbi-5543-27761-0074 I'M A MOTHER IS IT POSSIBLE THAT I SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO PROTECT HER SHE THOUGHT AS SHE IMAGINED THE VARIOUS ILLS THAT MIGHT BEFALL LELECHKA
lbi-5543-27761-0075 SHE PRAYED LONG THAT NIGHT BUT THE PRAYER DID NOT RELIEVE HER SADNESS
lbi-5543-27761-0076 SEVERAL DAYS PASSED LELECHKA CAUGHT COLD
lbi-5543-27761-0077 THE FEVER CAME UPON HER AT NIGHT
lbi-5543-27761-0078 WHEN SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA AWAKENED BY FEDOSYA CAME TO LELECHKA AND SAW HER LOOKING SO HOT SO RESTLESS AND SO TORMENTED SHE INSTANTLY RECALLED THE EVIL OMEN AND A HOPELESS DESPAIR TOOK POSSESSION OF HER FROM THE FIRST MOMENTS
lbi-5543-27761-0079 A DOCTOR WAS CALLED AND EVERYTHING WAS DONE THAT IS USUAL ON SUCH OCCASIONS BUT THE INEVITABLE HAPPENED
lbi-5543-27761-0080 AND LELECHKA GREW FEEBLER FROM HOUR TO HOUR
lbi-5543-27761-0081 NOTHING MADE HER SO UNHAPPY AS THE REITERATIONS OF FEDOSYA UTTERED BETWEEN SOBS SHE HID HERSELF AND HID HERSELF OUR LELECHKA
lbi-5543-27761-0082 FEVER WAS CONSUMING LELECHKA AND THERE WERE TIMES WHEN SHE LOST CONSCIOUSNESS AND SPOKE IN DELIRIUM
lbi-5543-27761-0083 THREE DAYS PASSED TORTURING LIKE A NIGHTMARE
lbi-5543-27761-0084 SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA HID HER FACE BEHIND THE CURTAINS NEAR LELECHKA'S BED HOW TRAGIC
lbi-5543-27761-0085 A WHITE MAMOCHKA WHISPERED LELECHKA
lbi-5543-27761-0086 MAMOCHKA'S WHITE FACE BECAME BLURRED AND EVERYTHING GREW DARK BEFORE LELECHKA
lbi-5543-27761-0087 SHE MET HER HUSBAND
lbi-5543-27761-0088 SERAFIMA AICKSANDROVNA WAS STANDING BY THE COFFIN AND LOOKING DULLY AT HER DEAD CHILD
lbi-5543-27761-0089 SIMA MY DEAR DON'T AGITATE YOURSELF SAID SERGEY MODESTOVICH IN A WHISPER
lbi-5543-27761-0090 YOU MUST RESIGN YOURSELF TO YOUR FATE
lbi-5543-27761-0091 SHE'LL BE UP IN A MINUTE PERSISTED SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA HER EYES FIXED ON THE DEAD LITTLE GIRL
lbi-5543-27761-0092 SERGEY MODESTOVICH LOOKED ROUND HIM CAUTIOUSLY HE WAS AFRAID OF THE UNSEEMLY AND OF THE RIDICULOUS
lbi-5543-27761-0093 SIMA DON'T AGITATE YOURSELF HE REPEATED
lbi-5543-27761-0094 HE WAS CONFUSED AND ANNOYED
lbi-5543-27761-0095 HER FACE SEEMED TRANQUIL AND HER EYES WERE DRY
lbi-5543-27761-0096 SHE WENT INTO THE NURSERY AND BEGAN TO WALK ROUND THE ROOM LOOKING INTO THOSE PLACES WHERE LELECHKA USED TO HIDE HERSELF
lbi-5543-27761-0097 SHE WALKED ALL ABOUT THE ROOM AND BENT NOW AND THEN TO LOOK UNDER THE TABLE OR UNDER THE BED AND KEPT ON REPEATING CHEERFULLY WHERE IS MY LITTLE ONE WHERE IS MY LELECHKA
lbi-5543-27761-0098 AFTER SHE HAD WALKED ROUND THE ROOM ONCE SHE BEGAN TO MAKE HER QUEST ANEW
lbi-5543-27761-0099 FEDOSYA MOTIONLESS WITH DEJECTED FACE SAT IN A CORNER AND LOOKED FRIGHTENED AT HER MISTRESS THEN SHE SUDDENLY BURST OUT SOBBING AND SHE WAILED LOUDLY
lbi-5543-27761-0100 SHE HID HERSELF AND HID HERSELF OUR LELECHKA OUR ANGELIC LITTLE SOUL
lbi-5543-27761-0101 WHEN SHE ENTERED THE PARLOUR THERE WERE SEVERAL PEOPLE BETWEEN HER AND LELECHKA
lbi-5543-27761-0102 THERE WAS AN OPPRESSIVE FEELING OF HEAVINESS IN SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA'S HEAD AS SHE APPROACHED LELECHKA
lbi-5543-27761-0103 LELECHKA LAY THERE STILL AND PALE AND SMILED PATHETICALLY
lbi-5543-27761-0104 THE LITTLE ONE DID NOT REPLY
lbi-5543-27761-0105 SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA STOOD UP ERECT SIGHED IN A LOST WAY SMILED AND CALLED LOUDLY LELECHKA
lbi-5543-27761-0106 LELECHKA WAS BEING CARRIED OUT
lbi-5849-50873-0000 CAPTAIN BULL THE COMMANDER OF A SMALL GARRISON AT SAYBROOK PERMITTED HIM TO LAND BUT WHEN THE GOVERNOR BEGAN TO READ HIS COMMISSION BULL ORDERED HIM TO BE SILENT
lbi-5849-50873-0001 WHAT HAS HAPPENED MISTER PRINCE WADSWORTH ASKED FOR HE COULD SEE THAT THE MAN WAS GREATLY EXCITED GOVERNOR ANDROS HAS COME AGAIN GASPED MISTER PRINCE WHY SHOULD THAT ALARM US THE FELLOW THOUGH GIVEN TO BOASTING IS NOT DANGEROUS OR LIABLE TO PUT HIS THREATS INTO EXECUTION BUT HE HAS GROWN DANGEROUS DECLARED MISTER PRINCE THE LIBERTIES OF THE COLONY ARE INVOLVED
lbi-5849-50873-0002 CAPTAIN WADSWORTH BECAME A LITTLE UNEASY THOUGH HE WAS STILL INCLINED TO TREAT THE MATTER LIGHTLY
lbi-5849-50873-0003 WE HAVE STUBBORNLY REFUSED TO YIELD OUR CHARTER VOLUNTARILY FOR IT IS THE GUARDIAN OF OUR POLITICAL RIGHTS
lbi-5849-50873-0004 THAT IS TRUE CAPTAIN WADSWORTH CONTINUED MISTER PRINCE AND TO SUBDUE OUR STUBBORNNESS THIS VICEROY HAS COME TO HARTFORD WITH SIXTY ARMED MEN TO DEMAND THE SURRENDER OF THE CHARTER IN PERSON
lbi-5849-50873-0005 CAPTAIN WADSWORTH BOUNDED TO HIS FEET IN A RAGE AND PLACING HIS HAND ON THE HILT OF HIS SWORD DECLARED HE SHALL NOT HAVE IT
lbi-5849-50873-0006 THE DAY WAS WELL NIGH SPENT WHEN HE ARRIVED AND THE MEMBERS WERE ENGAGED IN A HEATED DEBATE ON A SUBJECT OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE
lbi-5849-50873-0007 HE CONSENTED HOWEVER TO AWAIT THE DISCUSSION BUT AS SOON AS IT WAS ENDED HE DECLARED THAT HE WOULD HAVE THE CHARTER
lbi-5849-50873-0008 AFTER THE CAPTAIN HAD TAKEN TWO OR THREE TURNS ACROSS THE ROOM HE PAUSED AND ASKED
lbi-5849-50873-0009 WHAT IS THE ASSEMBLY DOING ENGAGED IN A DEBATE
lbi-5849-50873-0010 AND WILL HE WAIT UNTIL IT HAS ENDED HE HAS PROMISED TO DO SO
lbi-5849-50873-0011 MISTER PRINCE FIXED HIS AMAZED EYES ON THE CAPTAIN'S FACE AND READ THERE A DESPERATE DETERMINATION CAPTAIN HE BEGAN
lbi-5849-50873-0012 MISTER PRINCE BOWED AND HASTILY RETURNED TO THE HOUSE WHERE THE ASSEMBLY WAS IN SESSION
lbi-5849-50873-0013 AS SOON AS HE WAS GONE CHARLES STEVENS SAID
lbi-5849-50873-0014 YES CHARLES YOU WILL ANSWER WHAT DO YOU MEAN UNCLE
lbi-5849-50873-0015 NEVER DID DEBATERS TAKE GREATER INTEREST IN A MINOR SUBJECT
lbi-5849-50873-0016 WHAT DO YOU INTEND DOING UNCLE WILL YOU FIGHT THEM
lbi-5849-50873-0017 REMEMBER THE WORK MUST BE DONE RIGHT AT THE TIME NOT TOO SOON NOR TOO LATE
lbi-5849-50873-0018 THE SUN WAS SETTING AND THE CAPTAIN SAID
lbi-5849-50873-0019 COME CHARLES LET US HASTEN TO THE ASSEMBLY
lbi-5849-50873-0020 BY NO MEANS BUT I WANT YOU TO BE FULLY IMPRESSED WITH THE SERIOUSNESS OF YOUR MISSION
lbi-5849-50873-0021 TAKE YOUR PLACE CHARLES AND BE PREPARED TO DO YOUR PART WHISPERED CAPTAIN WADSWORTH
lbi-5849-50873-0022 CHARLES GOT AS CLOSE TO THE LONG TABLE USED BY THE SECRETARIES AS POSSIBLE WITHOUT ATTRACTING SPECIAL ATTENTION
lbi-5849-50873-0023 THE DISCUSSION WENT ON DARKNESS CAME AND FOUR LIGHTED CANDLES WERE PLACED ON THE TABLE AND TWO SET ON A SHELF ON THE WALL
lbi-5849-50873-0024 THOSE TWO CANDLES ON THE WALL WERE A GREAT ANNOYANCE TO CHARLES UNTIL HE SAW A MAN STATIONED NEAR THEM
lbi-5849-50873-0025 THOUGH THE LIGHTS WERE EXTINGUISHED THROUGH THE WINDOWS THE FAINT STARLIGHT DIMLY ILLUMINATED THE SCENE
lbi-5849-50873-0026 HE FOLLOWED HIM AS RAPIDLY AS HE COULD
lbi-5849-50873-0027 THE YOUTH WAS CLOSE BEHIND HIM AND WHEN THEY WERE OUTSIDE SEIZED HIS ARM
lbi-5849-50873-0028 BOY HAVE A CARE HOW YOU APPROACH ME
lbi-5849-50873-0029 THE SOLDIERS BEGAN TO CROWD ABOUT THE HOUSE WHEN AT A SIGNAL FROM CAPTAIN WADSWORTH THE TRAIN BANDS CAME ON THE SCENE AND PREPARED TO GRAPPLE WITH THE SOLDIERS
lbi-5849-50873-0030 WHERE IS THE CHARTER
lbi-5849-50873-0031 YOU HAVE YOUR SOLDIERS AT THE DOOR AND WE HAVE THE TRAIN BANDS OF CONNECTICUT READY TO DEFEND US AGAINST VIOLENCE
lbi-5849-50873-0032 WHO OF YOU HAS THE CHARTER
lbi-5849-50873-0033 IT WAS THE BOY CRIED THE ENRAGED GOVERNOR
lbi-5849-50873-0034 EVERY MEMBER OF THE ASSEMBLY SHOOK THEIR HEADS
lbi-5849-50873-0035 WE DO NOT KNOW HIM HE DOES NOT LIVE IN CONNECTICUT WHERE DOES HE LIVE
lbi-5849-50873-0036 LITTLE DID THE CAPTAIN OR HIS YOUTHFUL ASSISTANT DREAM THAT THEIR SIMPLE ACT WOULD MAKE THE OLD TREE HISTORIC
lbi-5849-50873-0037 THE TREE IN WHICH THE DOCUMENT WAS HIDDEN WAS EVER AFTERWARD KNOWN AS THE CHARTER OAK
lbi-5849-50873-0038 IT REMAINED VIGOROUS BEARING FRUIT EVERY YEAR UNTIL A LITTLE AFTER MIDNIGHT AUGUST EIGHTEEN FIFTY SIX WHEN IT WAS PROSTRATED BY A HEAVY STORM OF WIND
lbi-5849-50873-0039 WHEN THE ORDER FOR THE SEIZURE OF THE CHARTERS WAS FIRST MADE KNOWN THE ASSEMBLY OF RHODE ISLAND SENT A MOST LOYAL ADDRESS TO THE KING SAYING
lbi-5849-50873-0040 HE FORMALLY DISSOLVED THE ASSEMBLY BROKE THE SEAL OF THE COLONY WHICH BORE THE FIGURE OF AN ANCHOR AND THE WORD HOPE ADMITTED FIVE OF THE INHABITANTS INTO HIS LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL AND ASSUMED THE FUNCTIONS OF GOVERNOR BUT HE DID NOT TAKE AWAY THE PARCHMENT ON WHICH THE CHARTER WAS WRITTEN
lbi-5849-50873-0041 FROM THAT TIME UNTIL THE ENFORCED UNION OF THE COLONIES FOR MUTUAL DEFENCE AT THE BREAKING OUT OF THE FRENCH AND INDIAN WAR THE INHABITANTS OF RHODE ISLAND BORE THEIR SHARE IN THE DEFENSIVE EFFORTS ESPECIALLY WHEN THE HOSTILE SAVAGES HUNG ALONG THE FRONTIERS OF NEW YORK LIKE AN ILL OMENED CLOUD
lbi-5849-50873-0042 THE HISTORY OF THAT COMMONWEALTH IS IDENTIFIED WITH THAT OF ALL NEW ENGLAND FROM THE BEGINNING OF KING WILLIAM'S WAR SOON AFTER TO THE EXPULSION OF ANDROS
lbi-5849-50962-0000 CALLED BERT WHO HAD HEARD HIS UNCLE GETTING READY TO RUN DOWN TO THE WATER'S EDGE
lbi-5849-50962-0001 IT'S A SCHOONER SAID MISTER BINGHAM TO MISTER MINTURN AND SHE HAS A VERY HEAVY CARGO
lbi-5849-50962-0002 TO THIS CORD WAS FASTENED A HEAVY ROPE OR CABLE
lbi-5849-50962-0003 WHAT'S THAT BOARD FOR ASKED BERT AS HE SAW A BOARD FOLLOWING THE CABLE
lbi-5849-50962-0004 THAT'S THE DIRECTIONS SAID HAL
lbi-5849-50962-0005 THEY ARE PRINTED IN A NUMBER OF LANGUAGES AND THEY TELL THE CREW TO CARRY THE END OF THE CABLE HIGH UP THE MAST AND FASTEN IT STRONGLY THERE
lbi-5849-50962-0006 OH I SEE SAID BERT THE LINE WILL STRETCH THEN AND THE BREECHES BUOY WILL GO OUT ON A PULLEY
lbi-5849-50962-0007 IT WAS CLEAR DAY NOW AND MUCH OF THE WICKED STORM HAD PASSED
lbi-5849-50962-0008 WITH THE DAYLIGHT CAME GIRLS AND WOMEN TO THE BEACH
lbi-5849-50962-0009 MISSUS BOBBSEY MISSUS MINTURN NELLIE AND HER MOTHER BESIDES DOROTHY AND NAN WERE ALL THERE FLOSSIE AND FREDDIE BEING OBLIGED TO STAY HOME WITH DINAH AND SUSAN
lbi-5849-50962-0010 OF COURSE THE GIRLS ASKED ALL SORTS OF QUESTIONS AND BERT AND HAL TRIED TO ANSWER THEM AS BEST THEY COULD
lbi-5849-50962-0011 IT SEEMED A LONG TIME BEFORE ANY MOVEMENT OF THE CABLE SHOWED THAT THE BUOY WAS RETURNING
lbi-5849-50962-0012 NEARER AND NEARER IT CAME UNTIL NOW A MAN'S HEAD COULD BE SEEN
lbi-5849-50962-0013 THE GIRLS AND WOMEN WERE TOO FRIGHTENED TO TALK AND NELLIE CLUNG CLOSE TO HER MOTHER
lbi-5849-50962-0014 A BIG ROLLER DASHING IN FINISHED THE WORK FOR THE LIFE GUARDS AND A MAN IN THE CORK BELT BOUNDED UPON SHORE
lbi-5849-50962-0015 EVERYBODY GATHERED AROUND AND NELLIE WITH A STRANGE FACE AND A STRANGER HOPE BROKE THROUGH THE CROWD TO SEE THE RESCUED MAN
lbi-5849-50962-0016 OH IT IS MY FATHER SHE SCREAMED FALLING RIGHT INTO THE ARMS OF THE DRENCHED MAN
lbi-5849-50962-0017 BUT THE HALF DROWNED MAN RUBBED HIS EYES AS IF HE COULD NOT BELIEVE THEM THEN THE NEXT MINUTE HE PRESSED HIS LITTLE DAUGHTER TO HIS HEART UNABLE TO SPEAK A WORD
lbi-5849-50962-0018 AND IS GEORGE BINGHAM OUT THERE ANXIOUSLY ASKED THE BROTHER
lbi-5849-50962-0019 SAFE AND WELL CAME THE WELCOME ANSWER
lbi-5849-50962-0020 I GUESS OUR PRAYERS WERE HEARD LAST NIGHT
lbi-5849-50962-0021 HERE COMES ANOTHER MAN EXCLAIMED THE PEOPLE AS THIS TIME A BIG MAN DASHED ON THE SANDS
lbi-5849-50962-0022 WELL I DECLARE WE DID LAND ON A FRIENDLY SHORE
lbi-5849-50962-0023 JUST AS MISTER BINGHAM SAID THE LIFE SAVING WORK TURNED OUT TO BE A SOCIAL AFFAIR FOR THERE WAS A GREAT TIME GREETING NELLIE'S FATHER AND HAL'S UNCLE
lbi-5849-50962-0024 AND HAL AND HIS FATHER TOO PUT IN NAN
lbi-5849-50962-0025 WHAT A MORNING THAT WAS AT SUNSET BEACH
lbi-5849-50962-0026 I'M SO GLAD WE PRAYED SAID LITTLE FLOSSIE TO FREDDIE WHEN SHE HEARD THE GOOD NEWS
lbi-5849-50963-0000 A BEAUTIFUL DAY HAD GROWN OUT OF THE DREADFUL STORM
lbi-5849-50963-0001 AND EVERYBODY WAS SO HAPPY
lbi-5849-50963-0002 THE NEPTUNE THE VESSEL THAT HAD STRUCK ON THE SAND BAR WAS NOW SAFELY ANCHORED NEAR SHORE AND THE SAILORS CAME IN AND OUT IN ROW BOATS BACK AND FORTH TO LAND JUST AS THEY WISHED
lbi-5849-50963-0003 THEN WE HAD TO GO BACK TO WORK AT THE LOGS WENT ON THE CAPTAIN AND THEN ONE OF OUR CREW TOOK A FEVER
lbi-5849-50963-0004 THAT WAS WHAT DELAYED US SO
lbi-5849-50963-0005 FINALLY WE HAD EVERY LOG LOADED ON THE SCHOONER AND WE STARTED OFF
lbi-5849-50963-0006 WE COUNTED ON GETTING HOME LAST WEEK WHEN THIS LAST STORM STRUCK US AND DROVE US OUT OF OUR COURSE
lbi-5849-50963-0007 ABOUT THE VALUE ASKED MISTER BOBBSEY WHO WAS DOWN FROM THE CITY
lbi-5849-50963-0008 THE VALUE REPEATED THE CAPTAIN ASIDE SO THAT THE STRANGERS MIGHT NOT HEAR
lbi-5849-50963-0009 WELL I'M A RICH MAN NOW AND SO IS MY MATE MC LAUGHLIN FOR THAT WOOD WAS CONTRACTED FOR BY THE LARGEST AND RICHEST PIANO FIRM IN THIS COUNTRY AND NOW IT IS ALL BUT DELIVERED TO THEM AND THE MONEY IN OUR HANDS
lbi-5849-50963-0010 YES INDEED IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN US A LIFETIME TO ACCUMULATE AS MUCH MONEY AS WE HAVE EARNED IN THIS YEAR
lbi-5849-50963-0011 MAYBE AUNT EMILY WILL TAKE YOU DOWN TO THE CITY ON HER SHOPPING TOUR SUGGESTED NAN
lbi-5849-50963-0012 HE MADE THE CLERKS REMOVE ALL THE TRUCK FROM THE AISLES AND I GUESS EVERYBODY WAS GLAD THE ARMY FELL DOWN
lbi-5849-50963-0013 THE WONDERFUL FRESH AIR THAT THESE MEN LIVED IN NIGHT AND DAY HAD BRIGHTENED THEIR EYES TOO SO THAT EVEN THE PLAINEST FACE AND THE MOST AWKWARD MAN AMONG THEM WAS AS NIMBLE AS AN ATHLETE FROM HIS PERFECT EXERCISE
lbi-5849-50964-0000 I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SAY GOOD BY TO YOU NELLIE TOLD DOROTHY AND NAN NEXT MORNING
lbi-5849-50964-0001 OH THAT WILL BE SPLENDID DECLARED NAN
lbi-5849-50964-0002 YOU ARE QUITE RICH NOW AREN'T YOU REMARKED DOROTHY
lbi-5849-50964-0003 AND DOROTHY WENT UP AND DOWN THE ROOM LIKE THE PICTURES OF CINDERELLA'S PROUD SISTERS
lbi-5849-50964-0004 AND WE WILL BE ON HAND THANK YOU REPLIED THE JOKING DOROTHY
lbi-5849-50964-0005 COME NELLIE CALLED MISSUS MC LAUGHLIN I AM READY WHERE IS YOUR HAT
lbi-5849-50964-0006 WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO MANAGE THAT TOO NELLIE TOLD HIM
lbi-5849-50964-0007 MY UNCLE IS A FIREMAN AND HE CAN TAKE US THROUGH HIS ENGINE HOUSE
lbi-5849-50964-0008 MOST OF THEM I GUESS ANSWERED BERT
lbi-5849-50964-0009 WELL WE HAVE HAD A GOOD VACATION AND I AM WILLING TO GO TO WORK AGAIN
lbi-5849-50964-0010 SO AM I DECLARED NAN VACATION WAS JUST LONG ENOUGH I THINK
lbi-5849-50964-0011 MISTER BOBBSEY WAS DOWN FROM THE CITY OF COURSE TO TAKE THE FAMILY HOME AND NOW ALL HANDS EVEN FREDDIE AND FLOSSIE WERE BUSY PACKING UP
lbi-5849-50964-0012 THERE WERE THE SHELLS TO BE LOOKED AFTER THE FISH NETS BESIDES DOWNY THE DUCK AND SNOOP THE CAT
lbi-5849-50964-0013 AND SO OUR LITTLE FRIENDS HAD SPENT ALL THEIR VACATION
lbi-6123-59150-0000 HIS CHARACTERS GET DRUNK OR GO MAD WITH JEALOUSY OR FALL IN EPILEPTIC FITS OR RAVE HYSTERICALLY
lbi-6123-59150-0001 IF DOSTOEVSKY HAD HAD LESS VISION HE WOULD HAVE BEEN STRINDBERG
lbi-6123-59150-0002 LIKE THEM HE IS A NOVELIST OF TORTURE
lbi-6123-59150-0003 CERTAINLY THE LUST OF CRUELTY THE LUST OF DESTRUCTION FOR DESTRUCTION'S SAKE IS THE MOST CONSPICUOUS OF THE DEADLY SINS IN DOSTOEVSKY'S MEN AND WOMEN
lbi-6123-59150-0004 HE MAY NOT BE A CRUEL AUTHOR
lbi-6123-59150-0005 BUT THEY ARE NEVER IN BALANCE THEY ARE ALWAYS IN DEMONIACAL CONFLICT
lbi-6123-59150-0006 EVEN THE LUST IS NEVER OR HARDLY EVER THE LUST OF A MORE OR LESS SANE MAN
lbi-6123-59150-0007 DOSTOEVSKY COULD NOT HAVE DESCRIBED THE SIN OF NEKHLUDOV IN RESURRECTION
lbi-6123-59150-0008 THIS IS A MADHOUSE CRIES SOME ONE IN THE IDIOT
lbi-6123-59150-0009 ONE RESULT OF THIS IS A MULTIPLICITY OF ACTION
lbi-6123-59150-0010 EVEN THE TALK IS OF ACTIONS MORE THAN OF IDEAS
lbi-6123-59150-0011 HE SOWS VIOLENT DEEDS NOT WITH THE HAND BUT WITH THE SACK
lbi-6123-59150-0012 BUT ONE HAD NOTICED DURING THOSE LAST TWO DAYS THAT THE OTHER WAS WEARING A SILVER WATCH ON A YELLOW BEAD CHAIN WHICH HE SEEMS NOT TO HAVE SEEN ON HIM BEFORE
lbi-6123-59150-0013 HE TOOK A KNIFE AND WHEN HIS FRIEND HAD TURNED AWAY HE APPROACHED HIM CAUTIOUSLY FROM BEHIND TOOK AIM TURNED HIS EYES HEAVENWARDS CROSSED HIMSELF AND PRAYING FERVENTLY GOD FORGIVE ME FOR CHRIST'S SAKE
lbi-6123-59150-0014 HE NEVER PAINTS EVERYMAN HE ALWAYS PROJECTS DOSTOEVSKY OR A NIGHTMARE OF DOSTOEVSKY
lbi-6123-59150-0015 THAT IS WHY CRIME AND PUNISHMENT BELONGS TO A LOWER RANGE OF FICTION THAN ANNA KARENINA OR FATHERS AND SONS
lbi-6123-59150-0016 WE SYMPATHIZE INDEED WITH THE FEARS THE BRAVADO THE DESPAIR THAT SUCCEED THE CRIME
lbi-6123-59150-0017 HE IS A GROTESQUE MADE ALIVE BY SHEER IMAGINATIVE INTENSITY AND PASSION
lbi-6123-59150-0018 ONE DOES NOT GRUDGE AN ARTIST AN ABNORMAL CHARACTER OR TWO
lbi-6123-59150-0019 HE INVENTS VICIOUS GROTESQUES AS DICKENS INVENTS COMIC GROTESQUES
lbi-6123-59150-0020 WAS VERY FOND OF HANGING CATS AND BURYING THEM WITH GREAT CEREMONY
lbi-6123-59150-0021 AS FOR THE KARAMAZOVS THEMSELVES HE PORTRAYS THE OLD FATHER AND THE ELDEST OF HIS SONS HATING EACH OTHER AND FIGHTING LIKE BRUTAL MANIACS
lbi-6123-59150-0022 SERVE HIM RIGHT SHOUTED DMITRI BREATHLESSLY
lbi-6123-59150-0023 IF I HAVEN'T KILLED HIM I'LL COME AGAIN AND KILL HIM
lbi-6123-59150-0024 IT IS EASY TO SEE WHY DOSTOEVSKY HAS BECOME A POPULAR AUTHOR
lbi-6123-59150-0025 NO MELODRAMATIST EVER POURED OUT INCIDENT UPON THE STAGE FROM SUCH A HORN OF PLENTY
lbi-6123-59150-0026 DOSTOEVSKY IS ALWAYS READY TO SHOW THEM ALL IN AT ONCE
lbi-6123-59150-0027 ON TWO OPPOSITE PAGES OF THE IDIOT ONE FINDS THE FOLLOWING CHARACTERS BROUGHT IN BY NAME GENERAL EPANCHIN PRINCE S ADELAIDA IVANOVNA LIZAVETA PROKOFYEVNA YEVGENY PAVLOVITCH RADOMSKY PRINCESS BYELOKONSKY AGLAIA PRINCE MYSHKIN KOLYA IVOLGIN IPPOLIT VARYA FERDYSHCHENKO NASTASYA FILIPPOVNA NINA ALEXANDROVNA GANYA PTITSYN AND GENERAL IVOLGIN
lbi-6123-59150-0028 BUT THE SECRET OF DOSTOEVSKY'S APPEAL IS SOMETHING MORE THAN THE MULTITUDE AND THRILL OF HIS INCIDENTS AND CHARACTERS
lbi-6123-59150-0029 MISTER MURRY BOLDLY FACES THE DIFFICULTY AND ATTEMPTS THE DEFINITION
lbi-6123-59150-0030 TO HIM DOSTOEVSKY'S WORK IS THE RECORD OF A GREAT MIND SEEKING FOR A WAY OF LIFE IT IS MORE THAN A RECORD OF STRUGGLE IT IS THE STRUGGLE ITSELF
lbi-6123-59150-0031 AND THOSE VOICES TAKE SHAPE IN CERTAIN UNFORGETTABLE FRAGMENTS OF DIALOGUE THAT HAVE BEEN SPOKEN BY ONE SPIRIT TO ANOTHER IN SOME UGLY MEAN TAVERN SET IN SURROUNDING DARKNESS
lbi-6123-59150-0032 ULTIMATELY THEY ARE THE CREATIONS NOT OF A MAN WHO DESIRED TO BE BUT OF A SPIRIT WHICH SOUGHT TO KNOW
lbi-6123-59150-0033 BECAUSE THEY ARE POSSESSED THEY ARE NO LONGER MEN AND WOMEN
lbi-6123-59150-0034 THIS IS ALL IN A MEASURE TRUE
lbi-6123-59150-0035 TO SAY THIS IS NOT TO DENY THE SPIRITUAL CONTENT OF DOSTOEVSKY'S WORK THE ANGUISH OF THE IMPRISONED SOUL AS IT BATTLES WITH DOUBT AND DENIAL AND DESPAIR
lbi-6123-59150-0036 THERE IS IN DOSTOEVSKY A SUGGESTION OF CALIBAN TRYING TO DISCOVER SOME BETTER GOD THAN SETEBOS
lbi-6123-59150-0037 THE ULTIMATE ATTITUDE OF DOSTOEVSKY IS AS CHRISTIAN AS THE APOSTLE PETER'S LORD I BELIEVE HELP THOU MINE UNBELIEF
lbi-6123-59150-0038 AND BEYOND THE DARK NIGHT OF SUFFERING AND DISSIPATING THE NIGHT DOSTOEVSKY STILL SEES THE LIGHT OF CHRISTIAN COMPASSION
lbi-6123-59150-0039 OR EVEN BY THE COMPASSION OF OTHERS LIKE PRINCE MYSHKIN IN THE IDIOT
lbi-6123-59150-0040 HIS WORK LIKE HIS FACE BEARS THE MARK OF THIS TERRIBLE CONFLICT
lbi-6123-59150-0041 THE NOVELS ARE THE PERFECT IMAGE OF THE MAN
lbi-6123-59150-0042 AS TO THE MAN HIMSELF THE VICOMTE DE VOGUEE DESCRIBED HIM AS HE SAW HIM IN THE LAST YEARS OF HIS LIFE
lbi-6123-59150-0043 WHEN HE BECAME EXCITED ON A CERTAIN POINT ONE COULD HAVE SWORN THAT ONE HAD SEEN HIM BEFORE SEATED ON A BENCH IN A POLICE COURT AWAITING TRIAL OR AMONG VAGABONDS WHO PASSED THEIR TIME BEGGING BEFORE THE PRISON DOORS
lbi-6123-59150-0044 AT ALL OTHER TIMES HE CARRIED THAT LOOK OF SAD AND GENTLE MEEKNESS SEEN ON THE IMAGES OF OLD SLAVONIC SAINTS
lbi-6123-59150-0045 THAT IS THE PORTRAIT OF THE MAN ONE SEES BEHIND DOSTOEVSKY'S NOVELS A PORTRAIT ONE MIGHT ALMOST HAVE INFERRED FROM THE NOVELS
lbi-6123-59150-0046 IT IS A FIGURE THAT AT ONCE FASCINATES AND REPELS
lbi-6123-59186-0000 HE IS NOT BY TEMPERAMENT A SINGER
lbi-6123-59186-0001 HIS MUSIC IS A STILL SMALL VOICE UNEVENLY MATCHED AGAINST HIS CONSCIOUSNESS OF MIDNIGHT AND STORM
lbi-6123-59186-0002 TRUTH TO TELL MISTER HARDY IS NEITHER SUFFICIENTLY ARTICULATE NOR SUFFICIENTLY FASTIDIOUS TO BE A GREAT POET
lbi-6123-59186-0003 HE DOES NOT EXPRESS LIFE EASILY IN BEAUTIFUL WORDS OR IN IMAGES
lbi-6123-59186-0004 THUS HE WRITES IN I FOUND HER OUT THERE OF ONE WHO
lbi-6123-59186-0005 THERE COULD NOT BE AN UGLIER AND MORE PROSAIC EXAGGERATION THAN IS CONTAINED IN THE IMAGE IN THE LAST LINE
lbi-6123-59186-0006 AND PROSE INTRUDES IN THE CHOICE OF WORDS AS WELL AS IN IMAGES
lbi-6123-59186-0007 TAKE FOR EXAMPLE THE USE OF THE WORD DOMICILED IN THE PASSAGE IN THE SAME POEM ABOUT
lbi-6123-59186-0008 WHEN WE AS STRANGERS SOUGHT THEIR CATERING CARE VEILED SMILES BESPOKE THEIR THOUGHT OF WHAT WE WERE
lbi-6123-59186-0009 CATERING CARE IS AN APPALLING PHRASE
lbi-6123-59186-0010 IS A LINE OF GOOD POETRY
lbi-6123-59186-0011 YOU DID NOT COME AND MARCHING TIME DREW ON AND WORE ME NUMB YET LESS FOR LOSS OF YOUR DEAR PRESENCE THERE THAN THAT I THUS FOUND LACKING IN YOUR MAKE THAT HIGH COMPASSION WHICH CAN OVERBEAR RELUCTANCE FOR PURE LOVING KINDNESS SAKE GRIEVED I WHEN AS THE HOPE HOUR STROKED ITS SUM YOU DID NOT COME
lbi-6123-59186-0012 THERE ARE HINTS OF THE GRAND STYLE OF LYRIC POETRY IN THESE LINES BUT PHRASES LIKE IN YOUR MAKE AND AS THE HOPE HOUR STROKED ITS SUM ARE DISCORDS THAT BRING IT TUMBLING TO THE LEVELS OF VICTORIAN COMMONPLACE
lbi-6123-59186-0013 HE HAS A TEMPERAMENT SENSITIVE BEYOND THAT OF ALL BUT A FEW RECENT WRITERS TO THE PAIN AND PASSION OF HUMAN BEINGS
lbi-6123-59186-0014 ONE CAN REMEMBER POEM AFTER POEM OF HIS WITH A THEME THAT MIGHT EASILY HAVE SERVED FOR MISTER HARDY TOO LATE CRISTINA THE LOST MISTRESS THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER THE STATUE AND THE BUST TO NAME A FEW
lbi-6123-59186-0015 BUT WHAT A SENSE OF TRIUMPH THERE IS IN BROWNING'S TRAGEDIES
lbi-6123-59186-0016 HIS WORLD IS A PLACE OF OPULENCE NOT OF POVERTY
lbi-6123-59186-0017 TO HAVE LOVED EVEN FOR AN HOUR IS WITH BROWNING TO LIVE FOR EVER AFTER IN THE INHERITANCE OF A MIGHTY ACHIEVEMENT
lbi-6123-59186-0018 TO HAVE LOVED FOR AN HOUR IS IN MISTER HARDY'S IMAGINATION TO HAVE DEEPENED THE SADNESS EVEN MORE THAN THE BEAUTY OF ONE'S MEMORIES
lbi-6123-59186-0019 FOR THEN I UNDISTREST BY HEARTS GROWN COLD TO ME COULD LONELY WAIT MY ENDLESS REST WITH EQUANIMITY
lbi-6123-59186-0020 BUT TIME TO MAKE ME GRIEVE PART STEALS LETS PART ABIDE AND SHAKES THIS FRAGILE FRAME AT EVE WITH THROBBINGS OF NOONTIDE
lbi-6123-59186-0021 AND DESPAIR IS BY NO MEANS TRIUMPHANT IN WHAT IS PERHAPS THE MOST ATTRACTIVE OF ALL MISTER HARDY'S POEMS THE OXEN
lbi-6123-59186-0022 WE PICTURED THE MEEK MILD CREATURES WHERE THEY DWELT IN THEIR STRAWY PEN NOR DID IT OCCUR TO ONE OF US THERE TO DOUBT THEY WERE KNEELING THEN
lbi-6123-59186-0023 THE MOOD OF FAITH HOWEVER OR RATHER OF DELIGHT IN THE MEMORY OF FAITH IS NOT MISTER HARDY'S PREVAILING MOOD
lbi-6123-59186-0024 HE CAN ENTER UPON A WAR WITHOUT IRONICAL DOUBTS AS WE SEE IN THE SONG MEN WHO MARCH AWAY
lbi-6123-59186-0025 HOW LONG HE CRIES IN A POEM WRITTEN SOME YEARS AGO
lbi-6123-59186-0026 WHEN SHALL THE SANER SOFTER POLITIES WHEREOF WE DREAM HAVE SWAY IN EACH PROUD LAND AND PATRIOTISM GROWN GODLIKE SCORN TO STAND BONDSLAVE TO REALMS BUT CIRCLE EARTH AND SEAS
lbi-6123-59186-0027 BUT PERHAPS HIS CHARACTERISTIC ATTITUDE TO WAR IS TO BE FOUND NOT IN LINES LIKE THESE BUT IN THAT MELANCHOLY POEM THE SOULS OF THE SLAIN IN WHICH THE SOULS OF THE DEAD SOLDIERS RETURN TO THEIR COUNTRY AND QUESTION A SENIOR SOUL FLAME AS TO HOW THEIR FRIENDS AND RELATIVES HAVE KEPT THEIR DOUGHTY DEEDS IN REMEMBRANCE
lbi-6123-59186-0028 AND GENERAL HOW HOLD OUT OUR SWEETHEARTS SWORN LOYAL AS DOVES
lbi-6123-59186-0029 SOME FICKLE AND FLEET HEARTS HAVE FOUND THEM NEW LOVES
lbi-6123-59186-0030 AND OUR WIVES QUOTH ANOTHER RESIGNEDLY DWELL THEY ON OUR DEEDS
lbi-6123-59186-0031 MISTER HARDY HAS TOO BITTER A SENSE OF REALITY TO BELIEVE MUCH IN THE GLORY OF WAR
lbi-6123-59186-0032 THE REAL WORLD TO MISTER HARDY IS THE WORLD OF ANCIENT HUMAN THINGS IN WHICH WAR HAS COME TO BE A HIDEOUS IRRELEVANCE
lbi-6123-59186-0033 IT MAY BE THOUGHT ON THE OTHER HAND THAT MISTER HARDY'S POEMS ABOUT WAR ARE NO MORE EXPRESSIVE OF TRAGIC FUTILITY THAN HIS POEMS ABOUT LOVE
lbi-6123-59186-0034 FUTILITY AND FRUSTRATION ARE EVER RECURRING THEMES IN BOTH
lbi-6123-59186-0035 HIS LOVERS LIKE HIS SOLDIERS ROT IN THE GRAVE DEFEATED OF THEIR GLORY
lbi-6123-59186-0036 LOVERS ARE ALWAYS SEVERED BOTH IN LIFE AND IN DEATH
lbi-6123-59186-0037 IN BEYOND THE LAST LAMP WE HAVE THE SAME MOURNFUL CRY OVER SEVERANCE
lbi-6123-59186-0038 NO SHADE OF PINNACLE OR TREE OR TOWER WHILE EARTH ENDURES WILL FALL ON MY MOUND AND WITHIN THE HOUR STEAL ON TO YOURS ONE ROBIN NEVER HAUNT OUR TWO GREEN COVERTURES
lbi-6123-59186-0039 THEY BRING US FACE TO FACE WITH AN EXPERIENCE INTENSER THAN OUR OWN
lbi-6123-59186-0040 NOTHING OF TINIEST WORTH HAVE I WROUGHT PONDERED PLANNED NO ONE THING ASKING BLAME OR PRAISE SINCE THE PALE CORPSE LIKE BIRTH OF THIS DIURNAL UNIT BEARING BLANKS IN ALL ITS RAYS DULLEST OF DULL HUED DAYS
lbi-6267-53049-0000 IT'S A SAD THING FOR A BODY TO LACK BRAINS WHEN SHE WANTS TO BE A TEACHER ISN'T IT
lbi-6267-53049-0001 PENELOPE HAS STUDIED SO HARD ALL WINTER AND SHE HASN'T GONE ANYWHERE THOUGHT THE OLDER SISTER WISTFULLY
lbi-6267-53049-0002 DORIS DREAMED OF PRETTY DRESSES ALL THAT NIGHT AND THOUGHT ABOUT THEM ALL THE NEXT DAY
lbi-6267-53049-0003 SO IT MUST BE CONFESSED DID PENELOPE THOUGH SHE WOULD NOT HAVE ADMITTED IT FOR THE WORLD
lbi-6267-53049-0004 SHE KNEW THAT PENELOPE HAD STARTED OUT TO SAY A NEW DRESS
lbi-6267-53049-0005 DORIS HUNTER I BELIEVE IT'S AN OLD QUILT
lbi-6267-53049-0006 LISTEN PENELOPE MY DEAR DORIS
lbi-6267-53049-0007 LOVE TO PENELOPE AND YOURSELF
lbi-6267-53049-0008 YOUR AFFECTIONATE AUNT ADELLA HUNTER
lbi-6267-53049-0009 I DON'T SEE ITS BEAUTY SAID PENELOPE WITH A GRIMACE
lbi-6267-53049-0010 IT MAY HAVE BEEN PRETTY ONCE BUT IT IS ALL FADED NOW
lbi-6267-53049-0011 TELL ME DORRIE DOES IT ARGUE A LACK OF PROPER RESPECT FOR MY ANCESTORS THAT I CAN'T FEEL VERY ENTHUSIASTIC OVER THIS HEIRLOOM ESPECIALLY WHEN GRANDMOTHER HUNTER DIED YEARS BEFORE I WAS BORN
lbi-6267-53049-0012 IT WAS VERY KIND OF AUNT ADELLA TO SEND IT SAID DORIS DUTIFULLY
lbi-6267-53049-0013 WHY THE WRONG SIDE IS EVER SO MUCH PRETTIER THAN THE RIGHT EXCLAIMED PENELOPE
lbi-6267-53049-0014 WHAT LOVELY OLD TIMEY STUFF AND NOT A BIT FADED
lbi-6267-53049-0015 I DECLARE IT IS AS GOOD AS NEW
lbi-6267-53049-0016 WELL LET US GO AND HAVE TEA SAID PENELOPE I'M DECIDEDLY HUNGRY
lbi-6267-53049-0017 BESIDES I SEE THE POVERTY PUCKER COMING
lbi-6267-53049-0018 IT IS SOMETHING TO POSSESS AN HEIRLOOM AFTER ALL
lbi-6267-53049-0019 PENELOPE WAS SURPRISED AS MUCH AS THE TENDER SISTERLY HEART COULD WISH WHEN DORIS FLASHED OUT UPON HER TRIUMPHANTLY ON THE EVENING OF THE PARTY WITH THE BLACK SKIRT NICELY PRESSED AND RE HUNG AND THE PRETTIEST WAIST IMAGINABLE A WAIST THAT WAS A POSITIVE CREATION OF DAINTY ROSE BESPRINKLED SILK WITH A GIRDLE AND KNOTS OF BLACK VELVET
lbi-6267-53049-0020 SO PENELOPE WENT TO BLANCHE'S PARTY AND HER DRESS WAS THE ADMIRATION OF EVERY GIRL THERE
lbi-6267-53049-0021 PENELOPE THOUGHT HER ALTOGETHER CHARMING
lbi-6267-53049-0022 SHE LOOKS AS IF SHE HAD JUST STEPPED OUT OF THE FRAME OF SOME LOVELY OLD PICTURE SHE SAID TO HERSELF
lbi-6267-53049-0023 MY AUNT ADELLA GAVE ME GAVE US THE MATERIAL SHE STAMMERED
lbi-6267-53049-0024 I AM NAMED AFTER HER MISSUS FAIRWEATHER SUDDENLY PUT HER ARM ABOUT PENELOPE AND DREW THE YOUNG GIRL TO HER HER LOVELY OLD FACE AGLOW WITH DELIGHT AND TENDERNESS
lbi-6267-53049-0025 THEN YOU ARE MY GRANDNIECE SHE SAID
lbi-6267-53049-0026 WHEN I SAW YOUR DRESS I FELT SURE YOU WERE RELATED TO HER I SHOULD RECOGNIZE THAT ROSEBUD SILK IF I CAME ACROSS IT IN THIBET
lbi-6267-53049-0027 PENELOPE WAS FOUR YEARS OLDER THAN I WAS BUT WE WERE DEVOTED TO EACH OTHER
lbi-6267-53049-0028 SOON AFTER THIS OUR MOTHER DIED AND OUR HOUSEHOLD WAS BROKEN UP
lbi-6267-53049-0029 MY DEAR I AM A VERY LONELY OLD WOMAN WITH NOBODY BELONGING TO ME
lbi-6267-53049-0030 NOW SHE PATTED MISSUS FAIRWEATHER'S SOFT OLD HAND AFFECTIONATELY
lbi-6267-53049-0031 DORIS AND PENELOPE FOUND THEIR LIVES AND PLANS CHANGED IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE
lbi-6267-53049-0032 WHEN MISSUS FAIRWEATHER HAD GONE DORIS AND PENELOPE LOOKED AT EACH OTHER
lbi-6267-65525-0000 AS SHE SLIPPED INTO HER BLUE PRINT AFTERNOON DRESS HER AUNT CALLED TO HER FROM BELOW
lbi-6267-65525-0001 AUNT JANE WAS STANDING AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS WITH A LAMP IN ONE HAND AND A YEAR OLD BABY CLINGING TO THE OTHER
lbi-6267-65525-0002 SHE WAS A BIG SHAPELESS WOMAN WITH A ROUND GOOD NATURED FACE CHEERFUL AND VULGAR AS A SUNFLOWER WAS AUNT JANE AT ALL TIMES AND OCCASIONS
lbi-6267-65525-0003 I WANT TO RUN OVER AND SEE HOW MISSUS BRIXBY IS THIS EVENING SIDDY AND YOU MUST TAKE CARE OF THE BABY TILL I GET BACK
lbi-6267-65525-0004 SIDNEY SIGHED AND WENT DOWNSTAIRS FOR THE BABY
lbi-6267-65525-0005 ALL HER DAYS WERE ALIKE AS FAR AS HARD WORK AND DULLNESS WENT BUT SHE ACCEPTED THEM CHEERFULLY AND UNCOMPLAININGLY
lbi-6267-65525-0006 BUT SHE DID RESENT HAVING TO LOOK AFTER THE BABY WHEN SHE WANTED TO WRITE HER LETTER
lbi-6267-65525-0007 THE ROOM WAS SMALL A MERE BOX ABOVE THE KITCHEN WHICH SIDNEY SHARED WITH TWO SMALL COUSINS
lbi-6267-65525-0008 HER BED AND THE COT WHERE THE LITTLE GIRLS SLEPT FILLED UP ALMOST ALL THE AVAILABLE SPACE
lbi-6267-65525-0009 JUST AT THAT PARTICULAR ANGLE ONE EYE APPEARED TO BE AS LARGE AS AN ORANGE WHILE THE OTHER WAS THE SIZE OF A PEA AND THE MOUTH ZIGZAGGED FROM EAR TO EAR
lbi-6267-65525-0010 SIDNEY HATED THAT MIRROR AS VIRULENTLY AS SHE COULD HATE ANYTHING
lbi-6267-65525-0011 HER MOTHER HAD DIED THE DAY AFTER AND SIDNEY THEREUPON HAD COME INTO THE HANDS OF GOOD AUNT JANE WITH THOSE BOOKS FOR HER DOWRY SINCE NOTHING ELSE WAS LEFT AFTER THE EXPENSES OF THE DOUBLE FUNERAL HAD BEEN PAID
lbi-6267-65525-0012 PRESENTLY SHE BEGAN TO WRITE WITH A FLUSH OF REAL EXCITEMENT ON HER FACE
lbi-6267-65525-0013 ONLY ONE ANSWER CAME TO ELLEN DOUGLAS AND THAT WAS FORWARDED TO HER BY THE LONG SUFFERING EDITOR OF THE MAPLE LEAF
lbi-6267-65525-0014 HE WROTE THAT ALTHOUGH HIS AGE DEBARRED HIM FROM MEMBERSHIP IN THE CLUB HE WAS TWENTY AND THE LIMIT WAS EIGHTEEN HE READ THE LETTERS OF THE DEPARTMENT WITH MUCH INTEREST AND OFTEN HAD THOUGHT OF ANSWERING SOME OF THE REQUESTS FOR CORRESPONDENTS
lbi-6267-65525-0015 HE NEVER HAD DONE SO BUT ELLEN DOUGLAS'S LETTER WAS SO INTERESTING THAT HE HAD DECIDED TO WRITE TO HER
lbi-6267-65525-0016 WOULD SHE BE KIND ENOUGH TO CORRESPOND WITH HIM
lbi-6267-65525-0017 HE WAS TWO YEARS OUT FROM THE EAST AND HAD NOT YET FORGOTTEN TO BE HOMESICK AT TIMES
lbi-6267-65525-0018 SIDNEY LIKED THE LETTER AND ANSWERED IT
lbi-6267-65525-0019 SHE NEVER EXPECTED TO MEET JOHN LINCOLN NOR DID SHE WISH TO DO SO
lbi-6267-65525-0020 IN THE CORRESPONDENCE ITSELF SHE FOUND HER PLEASURE
lbi-6267-65525-0021 JOHN LINCOLN WROTE BREEZY ACCOUNTS OF RANCH LIFE AND ADVENTURES ON THE FAR WESTERN PLAINS SO ALIEN AND REMOTE FROM SNUG HUMDRUM PLAINFIELD LIFE THAT SIDNEY ALWAYS HAD THE SENSATION OF CROSSING A GULF WHEN SHE OPENED A LETTER FROM THE BAR N AS FOR SIDNEY'S OWN LETTER THIS IS THE WAY IT READ AS SHE WROTE IT
lbi-6267-65525-0022 THE EVERGREENS PLAINFIELD DEAR MISTER LINCOLN
lbi-6267-65525-0023 I LOVE LIFE AND ITS BLOOM AND BRILLIANCY I LOVE MEETING NEW PEOPLE I LOVE THE RIPPLE OF MUSIC THE HUM OF LAUGHTER AND CONVERSATION
lbi-6267-65525-0024 THE MAN I HAD BEEN TALKING WITH WAS PAUL MOORE THE GREAT NOVELIST
lbi-6267-65525-0025 AS IT WAS I HAD CONTRADICTED HIM TWICE AND HE HAD LAUGHED AND LIKED IT BUT HIS BOOKS WILL ALWAYS HAVE A NEW MEANING TO ME HENCEFORTH THROUGH THE INSIGHT HE HIMSELF HAS GIVEN ME
lbi-6267-65525-0026 IT IS SUCH MEETINGS AS THESE THAT GIVE LIFE ITS SPARKLE FOR ME
lbi-6267-65525-0027 YOU WILL BE WEARY OF MY RHAPSODIES OVER HER
lbi-6267-65525-0028 SHE HAS SYMPATHY AND UNDERSTANDING FOR MY EVERY MOOD
lbi-6267-65525-0029 YOURS SINCERELY SIDNEY RICHMOND
lbi-6267-65525-0030 AUNT JANE CAME HOME PRESENTLY AND CARRIED AWAY HER SLEEPING BABY SIDNEY SAID HER PRAYERS WENT TO BED AND SLEPT SOUNDLY AND SERENELY SHE MAILED HER LETTER THE NEXT DAY AND A MONTH LATER AN ANSWER CAME
lbi-6267-65525-0031 SIDNEY DID NOT SLEEP THAT NIGHT BUT TOSSED RESTLESSLY ABOUT OR CRIED IN HER PILLOW
lbi-6267-65525-0032 THE GOOD WOMAN SHOOK HER HEAD
lbi-6267-65525-0033 SIDNEY TROD THE WAY OF THE TRANSGRESSOR AND FOUND THAT ITS THORNS PIERCED TO BONE AND MARROW
lbi-6267-65525-0034 YOU SEE THAT ROAD OUT THAR
lbi-6267-65525-0035 AND THERE WAS NO HARBOUR OR GLIMPSE OF DISTANT SEA VISIBLE
lbi-6267-65525-0036 HAD THE HOTEL KEEPER MADE A MISTAKE
lbi-6267-65525-0037 THIS IS HIS PLACE NOBODY CALLS IT THE EVERGREENS BUT MYSELF
lbi-6267-65525-0038 I DON'T UNDERSTAND HE SAID PERPLEXEDLY
lbi-6267-65525-0039 OH SIDNEY THREW OUT HER HANDS IN A BURST OF PASSIONATE PROTEST
lbi-6267-65525-0040 NO AND YOU NEVER WILL UNDERSTAND I CAN'T MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND
lbi-6267-65525-0041 EVERYTHING I TOLD YOU ABOUT IT AND MY LIFE WAS JUST IMAGINATION
lbi-6267-65525-0042 THEN WHY DID YOU WRITE THEM HE ASKED BLANKLY
lbi-6267-65525-0043 WHY DID YOU DECEIVE ME
lbi-6267-65525-0044 OH I DIDN'T MEAN TO DECEIVE YOU I NEVER THOUGHT OF SUCH A THING
lbi-6267-65525-0045 I JUST COULDN'T WRITE YOU ABOUT MY LIFE HERE NOT BECAUSE IT WAS HARD BUT IT WAS SO UGLY AND EMPTY
lbi-6267-65525-0046 AND WHEN ONCE I HAD BEGUN I HAD TO KEEP IT UP
lbi-6267-65525-0047 I FOUND IT SO FASCINATING TOO
lbi-6267-65525-0048 THOSE LETTERS MADE THAT OTHER LIFE SEEM REAL TO ME I NEVER EXPECTED TO MEET YOU

lbi-6267-65525-0052 HE WAS SO HANDSOME SO MANLY SO EARNEST EYED
lbi-6267-65525-0053 JOHN LINCOLN OPENED THE GATE AND WENT UP TO HER
lbi-6267-65525-0054 PLEASE DON'T DISTRESS YOURSELF SO SIDNEY HE SAID UNCONSCIOUSLY USING HER CHRISTIAN NAME
lbi-6267-65525-0055 I THINK I DO UNDERSTAND
lbi-6267-65525-0056 I'M NOT SUCH A DULL FELLOW AS YOU TAKE ME FOR
lbi-6267-65525-0057 AFTER ALL THOSE LETTERS WERE TRUE OR RATHER THERE WAS TRUTH IN THEM
lbi-6267-65525-0058 THIS YOUNG MAN WAS CERTAINLY GOOD AT UNDERSTANDING
lbi-6267-65525-0059 YOU YOU'LL FORGIVE ME THEN SHE STAMMERED

lbi-6455-66379-0007 OH PRETTY GLIBLY SIR REPLIED THE MATE WE CAN SCARCELY TELL WHAT HEADWAY WE ARE MAKING FOR WE ARE OBLIGED TO KEEP THE MIDDLE OF THE RIVER AND THERE IS THE SHADOW OF A FOG RISING

lbi-6455-67803-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY THREE MAY I GO
lbi-6455-67803-0001 THE VERY DAY AFTER THIS OCTAVIA OPENED THE FOURTH TRUNK
lbi-6455-67803-0002 EVIDENTLY SOMETHING HAD HAPPENED OCTAVIA SHE SAID MISTER DUGALD BINNIE IS AT OLDCLOUGH WHO IS HE
lbi-6455-67803-0003 HE IS MY GRAND UNCLE EXPLAINED LUCIA TREMULOUSLY HE HAS A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY
lbi-6455-67803-0004 I DO NOT QUITE UNDERSTAND GRANDMAMMA OCTAVIA SHE SAID
lbi-6455-67803-0005 LAST NIGHT SHE CAME TO MY ROOM TO TALK TO ME AND THIS MORNING SHE CAME AGAIN AND OH
lbi-6455-67803-0006 SHE BROKE OUT INDIGNANTLY HOW COULD SHE SPEAK TO ME IN SUCH A MANNER
lbi-6455-67803-0007 WHAT DID YOU UNDERSTAND
lbi-6455-67803-0008 I AM TO RUN AFTER A MAN WHO DOES NOT CARE FOR ME AND MAKE MYSELF ATTRACTIVE IN THE HOPE THAT HE WILL CONDESCEND TO MARRY ME BECAUSE MISTER BINNIE MAY LEAVE ME HIS MONEY
lbi-6455-67803-0009 DO YOU WONDER THAT IT TOOK EVEN LADY THEOBALD A LONG TIME TO SAY THAT
lbi-6455-67803-0010 WELL REMARKED OCTAVIA YOU WON'T DO IT I SUPPOSE I WOULDN'T WORRY
lbi-6455-67803-0011 OH I ALWAYS KNEW IT I DIDN'T GUESS
lbi-6455-67803-0012 AND SHE SMILED EVER SO FAINTLY
lbi-6455-67803-0013 THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY SHE LOATHES ME SO SHE ADDED
lbi-6455-67803-0014 LUCIA THOUGHT DEEPLY FOR A MOMENT SHE RECOGNIZED ALL AT ONCE SEVERAL THINGS SHE HAD BEEN MYSTIFIED BY BEFORE
lbi-6455-67803-0015 OCTAVIA SMILED A LITTLE AGAIN
lbi-6455-67803-0016 LUCIA SAT THINKING HER HANDS CLASPED TIGHTLY
lbi-6455-67803-0017 I AM GLAD I CAME HERE SHE SAID AT LENGTH
lbi-6455-67803-0018 I THINK I SHALL NEVER BE AFRAID OF HER ANY MORE
lbi-6455-67803-0019 HER DELICATE NOSTRILS WERE DILATED SHE HELD HER HEAD UP HER BREATH CAME FAST THERE WAS A HINT OF EXULTATION IN HER TONE
lbi-6455-67803-0020 SHE WALKED VERY FAST AFTER SHE LEFT THE HOUSE
lbi-6455-67803-0021 BUT IT WAS NOT AGAINST HIM THAT LUCIA'S INDIGNATION WAS AROUSED
lbi-6455-67803-0022 SHE WONDERED IF HE HAD HEARD HER LAST WORDS SHE FANCIED HE HAD
lbi-6455-67803-0023 HE TOOK HOLD OF HER SHAKING LITTLE HAND AND LOOKED DOWN AT HER EXCITED FACE
lbi-6455-67803-0024 I AM ANGRY SHE SAID YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN ME ANGRY BEFORE
lbi-6455-67803-0025 I AM ON MY WAY TO MY TO LADY THEOBALD
lbi-6455-67803-0026 HE HELD HER HAND AS CALMLY AS BEFORE
lbi-6455-67803-0027 WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO SAY TO HER HE ASKED SHE LAUGHED AGAIN
lbi-6455-67803-0028 HE HELD HER HAND RATHER CLOSER
lbi-6455-67803-0029 SHE HAS MADE YOU VERY ANGRY HE SAID
lbi-6455-67803-0030 AND THEN ALMOST BEFORE SHE KNEW WHAT SHE WAS DOING SHE WAS POURING FORTH THE WHOLE OF HER STORY EVEN MORE OF IT THAN SHE HAD TOLD OCTAVIA
lbi-6455-67803-0031 LUCIA HE SAID I WISH YOU WOULD LET ME GO AND TALK WITH LADY THEOBALD YOU SHE SAID WITH A LITTLE START
lbi-6455-67803-0032 YES HE ANSWERED LET ME GO TO HER
lbi-6455-67803-0033 IF YOU WILL SAY YES TO THAT I THINK I CAN PROMISE THAT YOU NEED NEVER BE AFRAID OF HER ANY MORE
lbi-6455-67803-0034 THE FIERCE COLOR DIED OUT OF HER CHEEKS AND THE TEARS RUSHED TO HER EYES
lbi-6455-67803-0035 SHE RAISED HER FACE WITH A PATHETIC LOOK
lbi-6455-67803-0036 I AM DESPERATELY IN LOVE WITH YOU HE ANSWERED IN HIS QUIETEST WAY
lbi-6455-67804-0000 I ACCOMPANY MY GRANDDAUGHTER TO THIS THIS ENTERTAINMENT HER LADYSHIP RESPONDED
lbi-6455-67804-0001 IT IS SCARCELY A JOYOUS OCCASION TO MY MIND
lbi-6455-67804-0002 NO NEED TO DRESS YOURSELF LIKE THAT IF IT ISN'T EJACULATED MISTER BINNIE
lbi-6455-67804-0003 IF I WERE SURE THIS WAS THE SAME MAN I'D GO MYSELF
lbi-6455-67804-0004 WHEN I FIND A FELLOW WHO'S NEITHER KNAVE NOR FOOL I STICK TO HIM BELIEVE I'LL SEND TO FIND OUT
lbi-6455-67804-0005 THE ONLY TIME HE HAD MADE ANY COMMENT UPON HER WAS THE FIRST TIME HE SAW HER IN THE DRESS SHE HAD COPIED FROM OCTAVIA'S NICE GOWN THAT HE BLURTED OUT DIDN'T GET IT HERE I'LL WAGER
lbi-6455-67804-0006 DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT HE SAID GRUFFLY
lbi-6455-67804-0007 NO SHE ANSWERED I AM NOT AFRAID AT ALL
lbi-6455-67804-0008 I SHALL NOT BE AFRAID AGAIN
lbi-6455-67804-0009 IN FACT SHE HAD PERFECTLY CONFOUNDED HER LADYSHIP BY HER DEMEANOR
lbi-6455-67804-0010 I BEG YOU WILL NOT SPEAK TO ME OF THAT AGAIN SHE SAID I WILL NOT LISTEN
lbi-6455-67804-0011 AND TURNING ABOUT SHE WALKED OUT OF THE ROOM
lbi-6455-67804-0012 AND NOTHING MORE HAD BEEN SAID ON THE SUBJECT SINCE
lbi-6455-67804-0013 BEFORE BREAKFAST MISS BELINDA WAS STARTLED BY THE ARRIVAL OF ANOTHER TELEGRAM WHICH RAN AS FOLLOWS

lbi-6455-67804-0016 WELL REMARKED OCTAVIA I SUPPOSE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN AN ADVANTAGE
lbi-6455-67804-0017 OCTAVIA WAS A MARKED FIGURE UPON THE GROUNDS AT THAT GARDEN PARTY ANOTHER DRESS MY DEAR REMARKED MISSUS BURNHAM
lbi-6455-67804-0018 AND WHAT A CHARMING COLOR SHE HAS I DECLARE SHE IS USUALLY PALER
lbi-6455-67804-0019 PERHAPS WE OWE THIS TO LORD LANSDOWNE
lbi-6455-67804-0020 SHE'S PRETTIER THAN EVER TO DAY AND IS ENJOYING HERSELF
lbi-6455-67804-0021 SHE WAS ENJOYING HERSELF MISTER FRANCIS BAROLD OBSERVED IT RATHER GLOOMILY AS HE STOOD APART
lbi-6455-67804-0022 AND THEN HAD COME LORD LANSDOWNE WHO IN CROSSING THE LAWN TO SHAKE HANDS WITH HIS HOST HAD BEEN OBSERVED TO KEEP HIS EYE FIXED UPON ONE PARTICULAR POINT BURMISTONE HE SAID AFTER HAVING SPOKEN HIS FIRST WORDS WHO IS THAT TALL GIRL IN WHITE
lbi-6455-67804-0023 AND IN TEN MINUTES LADY THEOBALD MISSUS BURNHAM MISTER BAROLD AND DIVERS OTHERS TOO NUMEROUS TO MENTION SAW HIM STANDING AT OCTAVIA'S SIDE EVIDENTLY WITH NO INTENTION OF LEAVING IT
lbi-6455-67804-0024 NOT LONG AFTER THIS FRANCIS BAROLD FOUND HIS WAY TO MISS BELINDA WHO WAS VERY BUSY AND RATHER NERVOUS YOUR NIECE IS EVIDENTLY ENJOYING HERSELF HE REMARKED
lbi-6455-67804-0025 OCTAVIA IS MOST HAPPY TO DAY ANSWERED MISS BELINDA
lbi-6455-67804-0026 VERY FEW PEOPLE UNDERSTAND OCTAVIA SAID MISS BELINDA I'M NOT SURE THAT I FOLLOW ALL HER MOODS MYSELF
lbi-6455-67804-0027 SHE IS NOT AS FRIVOLOUS AS SHE APPEARS TO THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW HER WELL
lbi-6455-67804-0028 BAROLD STOOD GNAWING HIS MUSTACHE AND MADE NO REPLY HE WAS NOT VERY COMFORTABLE
lbi-6455-67804-0029 HE FELT HIMSELF ILL USED BY FATE AND RATHER WISHED HE HAD RETURNED TO LONDON FROM BROADOAKS INSTEAD OF LOITERING IN SLOWBRIDGE
lbi-6455-67804-0030 HE HAD AMUSED HIMSELF AT FIRST BUT IN TIME HE HAD BEEN SURPRISED TO FIND HIS AMUSEMENT LOSE SOMETHING OF ITS ZEST
lbi-6455-67804-0031 IT'S DEUCEDLY BAD FORM ON HIS PART HE SAID MENTALLY WHAT DOES HE MEAN BY IT
lbi-6455-67804-0032 OCTAVIA ON THE CONTRARY DID NOT ASK WHAT HE MEANT BY IT

lbi-6455-67804-0037 WHAT HAS HAPPENED SHE ASKED RIGIDLY HE LOOKED SLIGHTLY SURPRISED NOTHING WHATEVER HE REPLIED
lbi-6455-67804-0038 I HAVE REMAINED HERE LONGER THAN I INTENDED
lbi-6455-67804-0039 SHE BEGAN TO MOVE THE MANACLES ON HER RIGHT WRIST
lbi-6455-67804-0040 SHE HAD NOT BROUGHT LUCIA UP UNDER HER OWN EYE FOR NOTHING
lbi-6467-56885-0000 HIS BODY WAS LONG AND SLENDER HARD AND AGILE HIS SIGHT KEEN HIS AIM UNERRING
lbi-6467-56885-0001 IN THE MONTH OF AGRAHAYAN KANTI HAD GONE OUT SHOOTING NEAR THE SWAMP OF NYDIGHI WITH A FEW SPORTING COMPANIONS
lbi-6467-56885-0002 ONE MORNING AS KANTI WAS SEATED IN HIS BOAT CLEANING A FAVOURITE GUN HE SUDDENLY STARTED AT WHAT HE THOUGHT WAS THE CRY OF WILD DUCK LOOKING UP HE SAW A VILLAGE MAIDEN COMING TO THE WATER'S EDGE WITH TWO WHITE DUCKLINGS CLASPED TO HER BREAST
lbi-6467-56885-0003 THE GIRL PUT THE BIRDS INTO THE WATER AND WATCHED THEM ANXIOUSLY
lbi-6467-56885-0004 LOOKING ROUND KANTI SAW ONE OF HIS MEN POINTING AN UNLOADED GUN AT THE DUCKS
lbi-6467-56885-0005 KANTI WENT ON CLEANING HIS GUN
lbi-6467-56885-0006 AFTER KANTI HAD EATEN AND DRUNK THE BRAHMIN BEGGED HIM TO INTRODUCE HIMSELF KANTI GAVE HIS OWN NAME HIS FATHER'S NAME AND THE ADDRESS OF HIS HOME AND THEN SAID IN THE USUAL WAY IF I CAN BE OF ANY SERVICE SIR I SHALL DEEM MYSELF FORTUNATE
lbi-6467-56885-0007 SO SAYING KANTI REPEATED HIS SALUTE AND WENT BACK
lbi-6467-56885-0008 THE BRICK BUILT MANSION OF THE MAZUMDARS HAD BEEN BORROWED FOR THE WEDDING CEREMONY WHICH WAS FIXED FOR NEXT MAGH AS KANTI DID NOT WISH TO DELAY
lbi-6467-56885-0009 IN DUE TIME THE BRIDEGROOM ARRIVED ON HIS ELEPHANT WITH DRUMS AND MUSIC AND WITH A TORCHLIGHT PROCESSION AND THE CEREMONY BEGAN
lbi-6467-56885-0010 IN THAT BASHFUL DOWNCAST FACE CROWNED WITH THE WEDDING CORONET AND BEDECKED WITH SANDAL PASTE HE COULD SCARCELY RECOGNISE THE VILLAGE MAIDEN OF HIS FANCY AND IN THE FULNESS OF HIS EMOTION A MIST SEEMED TO BECLOUD HIS EYES
lbi-6467-56885-0011 THE LIGHT OF THE LAMPS SEEMED TO GROW DIM AND DARKNESS TO TARNISH THE FACE OF THE BRIDE HERSELF
lbi-6467-56885-0012 AT FIRST HE FELT ANGRY WITH HIS FATHER IN LAW THE OLD SCOUNDREL HAD SHOWN HIM ONE GIRL AND MARRIED HIM TO ANOTHER
lbi-6467-56885-0013 CLOSE UPON IT FOLLOWED THE GIRL HE HAD SEEN BEFORE

lbi-6467-56885-0015 ALL THE WOMEN IN THE ROOM BEGAN TO TITTER
lbi-6467-56885-0016 THE INCREASING LAUGHTER IN THE ROOM BETOKENED AN AMUSING JOKE
lbi-6467-56885-0017 WITH A SIGH OF INTENSE RELIEF AS OF ESCAPE FROM CALAMITY HE LOOKED ONCE MORE INTO THE FACE OF HIS BRIDE
lbi-6467-62797-0000 OUT OF CURIOSITY HE HUNG ONE OF THEM OUTSIDE HIS HOUSE

lbi-6467-94831-0044 PELEG THERE IS SOME MISTAKE HERE
lbi-6467-94831-0045 OH YOU CAN'T JOKE ME NO MORE
lbi-6467-97061-0000 ONE NIGHT WHEN BOTH WERE SLEEPING THE PRINCE HAD A REMARKABLE DREAM
lbi-6467-97061-0001 THEY RUSHED INTO THE ROOM ADDED THEIR CRIES TO HERS AND FORGETTING ALL THEIR FORMER PRECAUTIONS LEFT THE DOORS OPEN SO THAT THE GUARDS OUTSIDE HEARING THE CLAMOUR ENTERED AND SAW THE PRINCE
lbi-6467-97061-0002 SHE IS A DISGRACE TO HER FAMILY AND SHALL SOON SEE HER HUSBAND IMPALED ON A STAKE
lbi-6467-97061-0003 THEN WITH HIS FOREHEAD DISFIGURED BY A FEARFUL FROWN HE CONTINUED TO ABUSE THE PRINCE AND HAVING TIED HIS HANDS BEHIND HIM DRAGGED HIM FROM THE ROOM
lbi-6467-97061-0004 TREATED THUS LIKE SOME WILD BEAST ROUGHLY SHAKEN AND NEGLECTED RAJAVAHANA WOULD HAVE SUFFERED GREATLY HAD HE NOT BEEN PROTECTED BY THE MAGIC JEWEL GIVEN TO HIM IN PATALA AND WHICH HE HAD CONTRIVED TO CONCEAL IN HIS HAIR
lbi-6467-97061-0005 ADVANCING THEREFORE WITH A LARGE ARMY HE PREPARED TO BESIEGE CHAMPA THE CAPITAL CITY
lbi-6467-97061-0006 A TERRIBLE BATTLE ENSUED IN WHICH BOTH KINGS PERFORMED PRODIGIES OF VALOUR
lbi-6467-97061-0007 SHOULD THERE BE ANY PITY FOR THE VIOLATOR OF THE HAREM
lbi-6467-97061-0008 IF THE OLD KING MY FATHER NOW IN HIS DOTAGE WAS FOOLISH ENOUGH TO FAVOUR THE CRIMINAL FOR THE SAKE OF HIS WORTHLESS DAUGHTER YOU HAD NO NEED OF HIS PERMISSION AND OUGHT NOT TO HAVE BEEN INFLUENCED BY HIM
lbi-6467-97061-0009 LET THAT VILE SEDUCER BE IMMEDIATELY PUT TO DEATH BY TORTURE AND HIS PARAMOUR BE SHUT UP IN PRISON TILL I COME
lbi-6467-97061-0010 HAVE READY ALSO A FIERCE ELEPHANT SUITABLY EQUIPPED WHICH I SHALL MOUNT IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE WEDDING TO OVERTAKE MY ARMY IN MARCH AGAINST THE ENEMY AND AS I SET OUT I WILL MAKE THE ELEPHANT TRAMPLE THE LIFE OUT OF THAT CRIMINAL
lbi-6467-97061-0011 WHILE HE STOOD THERE CALMLY AWAITING DEATH WHICH NOW SEEMED INEVITABLE HE SUDDENLY FELT HIS FEET FREE AND A BEAUTIFUL LADY APPEARED BEFORE HIM
lbi-6467-97061-0012 SHE HUMBLY BOWING DOWN SAID LET MY LORD PARDON HIS SERVANT FOR THE INJURY WHICH SHE HAS UNCONSCIOUSLY CAUSED
lbi-6467-97061-0013 I AM AN APSARAS BORN FROM THE RAYS OF THE MOON
lbi-6467-97061-0014 ONE DAY AS I WAS FLYING THROUGH THE AIR WEARING A WHITE DRESS A SWAN MISTAKING ME FOR A LOTUS FLOWER ATTACKED ME
lbi-6467-97061-0015 IN HIS ANGER HE CURSED ME SAYING O WICKED ONE FOR THIS OFFENCE YOU ARE CONDEMNED TO BE CHANGED INTO A PIECE OF UNCONSCIOUS METAL
lbi-6467-97061-0016 THE CHANGE TOOK PLACE IMMEDIATELY AND I FELL TO THE GROUND TURNED INTO A SILVER CHAIN
lbi-6467-97061-0017 ON HIS WAY HE SAW THE SILVER FETTER DESCENDED TO THE GROUND PICKED IT UP AND CONTINUED HIS FLIGHT
lbi-6467-97061-0018 THE SLAYER OF CHANDAVARMA HEARING THIS CAME OUT OF THE PALACE AND QUICKLY MOUNTING THE ELEPHANT WHO HELD DOWN HIS TRUNK TO RECEIVE HIM PLACED HIMSELF BEHIND THE PRINCE
lbi-6467-97061-0019 GREAT WAS THEIR MUTUAL ASTONISHMENT AND JOY WHEN THEY RECOGNISED EACH OTHER THE PRINCE EXCLAIMING IS IT POSSIBLE
lbi-6467-97061-0020 IS IT REALLY YOU MY DEAR FRIEND APAHARAVARMA WHO HAVE DONE THIS DEED
lbi-6467-97061-0021 THROUGH THESE THEY FORCED THEIR WAY EMPLOYING WITH GOOD EFFECT THE WEAPONS PLACED ON THE ELEPHANT FOR THE USE OF CHANDAVARMA
lbi-6467-97061-0022 BEFORE HOWEVER THEY HAD GONE FAR THEY HEARD THE NOISE OF BATTLE AT A DISTANCE AND SAW THE SOLDIERS IN FRONT OF THEM SCATTERED IN ALL DIRECTIONS
lbi-6467-97061-0023 WE HAVE JUST NOW ENCOUNTERED AND UTTERLY DEFEATED THE ENEMY SO THAT THERE IS NO FEAR OF ANY FURTHER RESISTANCE
lbi-6467-97061-0024 RAJAVAHANA AGREED TO THIS
lbi-6599-38590-0000 WHATEVER HAND IT WAS THAT SHOT DOWN BOURBON ROME AFTER HIS DEATH WAS PLUNDERED DEVASTATED AND RAVAGED BY A BRUTAL GREEDY LICENTIOUS AND FANATICAL SOLDIERY
lbi-6599-38590-0001 WHEREFORE FOR THE FUTURE WRITE US NOTHING AT ALL BUT APPOINT US THE TIME AND PLACE OF MEETING AND WE WILL BRING OUR SWORD FOR YOU TO CROSS PROTESTING THAT THE SHAME OF ANY DELAY IN FIGHTING SHALL BE YOURS SEEING THAT WHEN IT COMES TO AN ENCOUNTER THERE IS AN END OF ALL WRITING
lbi-6599-38590-0002 SIR ANSWERED THE SPANIARD PERMIT ME TO DO MY OFFICE AND SAY WHAT THE EMPEROR HAS CHARGED ME TO SAY
lbi-6599-38590-0003 NAY I WILL NOT LISTEN TO THEE SAID FRANCIS IF THOU DO NOT FIRST GIVE ME A PATENT SIGNED BY THY MASTER CONTAINING AN APPOINTMENT OF TIME AND PLACE SIR I HAVE ORDERS TO READ YOU THE CARTEL AND GIVE IT YOU AFTERWARDS
lbi-6599-38590-0004 BURGUNDY WITHOUT BEING PUT OUT BEGAN AGAIN SIR
lbi-6599-38590-0005 NAY SAID FRANCIS I WILL NOT SUFFER HIM TO SPEAK TO ME BEFORE HE HAS GIVEN ME APPOINTMENT OF TIME AND PLACE
lbi-6599-38590-0006 GIVE IT ME OR RETURN AS THOU HAST COME
lbi-6599-38590-0007 I AM QUITE WILLING SAID THE KING LET HIM HAVE IT
lbi-6599-38590-0008 THE PEACE OF CAMBRAI WAS CALLED THE LADIES PEACE IN HONOR OF THE TWO PRINCESSES WHO HAD NEGOTIATED IT THOUGH MORALLY DIFFERENT AND OF VERY UNEQUAL WORTH THEY BOTH HAD MINDS OF A RARE ORDER AND TRAINED TO RECOGNIZE POLITICAL NECESSITIES AND NOT TO ATTEMPT ANY BUT POSSIBLE SUCCESSES
lbi-6599-38590-0009 ALL THE GREAT POLITICAL ACTORS SEEMED HURRYING AWAY FROM THE STAGE AS IF THE DRAMA WERE APPROACHING ITS END
lbi-6599-38591-0000 IN FIFTEEN SIXTY TWO AT THE BATTLE OF DREUX HE WAS AGED AND SO ILL THAT NONE EXPECTED TO SEE HIM ON HORSEBACK
lbi-6599-38591-0001 HE FULLY ARMED SAVE ONLY HIS HEAD ANSWERED HIM RIGHT WELL SIR THIS IS THE REAL MEDICINE THAT HATH CURED ME FOR THE BATTLE WHICH IS TOWARD AND A PREPARING FOR THE HONOR OF GOD AND OUR KING
lbi-6599-38591-0002 THE LADIES PEACE CONCLUDED AT CAMBRAI IN FIFTEEN TWENTY NINE LASTED UP TO FIFTEEN THIRTY SIX INCESSANTLY TROUBLED HOWEVER BY FAR FROM PACIFIC SYMPTOMS PROCEEDINGS AND PREPARATIONS
lbi-6599-38591-0003 AT LAST HE DECIDED UPON RETREATING
lbi-6599-38591-0004 IT WAS GARCILASO DE LA VEGA THE PRINCE OF SPANISH POESY THE SPANISH PETRARCH ACCORDING TO HIS FELLOW COUNTRYMEN
lbi-6599-38591-0005 MONTMORENCY SIGNED A SIMILAR ONE FOR PIEDMONT
lbi-6599-38591-0006 THEY ALL REPAIRED TOGETHER TO THE HOUSE PREPARED FOR THEIR RECEPTION AND AFTER DINNER THE EMPEROR BEING TIRED LAY DOWN TO REST ON A COUCH QUEEN ELEANOR BEFORE LONG WENT AND TAPPED AT HIS DOOR AND SENT WORD TO THE KING THAT THE EMPEROR WAS AWAKE
lbi-6599-38591-0007 FRANCIS WITH THE CARDINAL DE LORRAINE AND THE CONSTABLE DE MONTMORENCY SOON ARRIVED
lbi-6599-38591-0008 ON ENTERING THE CHAMBER HE FOUND THE EMPEROR STILL LYING DOWN AND CHATTING WITH HIS SISTER THE QUEEN WHO WAS SEATED BESIDE HIM ON A CHAIR
lbi-6599-38591-0009 YES SAID CHARLES I HAD MADE SUCH CHEER THAT I WAS OBLIGED TO SLEEP IT OFF
lbi-6599-38591-0010 FRANCIS DID THE CONVERSE WITH HIS OWN COLLAR
lbi-6599-38591-0011 ONLY SEVEN OF THE ATTENDANTS REMAINED IN THE EMPEROR'S CHAMBER AND THERE THE TWO SOVEREIGNS CONVERSED FOR AN HOUR AFTER WHICH THEY MOVED TO THE HALL WHERE A SPLENDID SUPPER AWAITED THEM
lbi-6599-38591-0012 THE GHENTESE PLEADED THEIR PRIVILEGE OF NOT BEING LIABLE TO BE TAXED WITHOUT THEIR OWN CONSENT
lbi-6599-38591-0013 ORDERS HAD BEEN SENT EVERYWHERE TO RECEIVE HIM AS KINGS OF FRANCE ARE RECEIVED ON THEIR JOYOUS ACCESSION
lbi-6841-88291-0000 BUT SINCE THERE EXISTED FOR US NO RESPONSIBILITY WE EACH REPORTED DUTIFULLY AT THE ROLL CALL OF HABIT AND DROPPED BACK INTO OUR BLANKETS WITH A GRATEFUL SIGH
lbi-6841-88291-0001 I REMEMBER THE MOON SAILING A GOOD GAIT AMONG APPARENTLY STATIONARY CLOUDLETS I RECALL A DEEP BLACK SHADOW LYING BEFORE DISTANT SILVERY MOUNTAINS I GLANCED OVER THE STARK MOTIONLESS CANVASES EACH OF WHICH CONCEALED A MAN THE AIR TREMBLED WITH THE BELLOWING OF CATTLE IN THE CORRALS
lbi-6841-88291-0002 SEEMINGLY BUT A MOMENT LATER THE COOK'S HOWL BROUGHT ME TO CONSCIOUSNESS AGAIN
lbi-6841-88291-0003 THREE WERE TO CARE FOR THE REMUDA FIVE WERE TO MOVE THE STRAY HERD FROM THE CORRALS TO GOOD FEED THREE BRANDING CREWS WERE TOLD TO BRAND THE CALVES WE HAD COLLECTED IN THE CUT OF THE AFTERNOON BEFORE THAT TOOK UP ABOUT HALF THE MEN
lbi-6841-88291-0004 THE REST WERE TO MAKE A SHORT DRIVE IN THE SALT GRASS
lbi-6841-88291-0005 WE WERE THE ONLY ONES WHO DID GO AFOOT HOWEVER ALTHOUGH THE CORRALS WERE NOT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YARDS DISTANT
lbi-6841-88291-0006 BETWEEN THE UPRIGHT BARS OF GREASEWOOD WE COULD SEE THE CATTLE AND NEAR THE OPPOSITE SIDE THE MEN BUILDING A FIRE NEXT THE FENCE
lbi-6841-88291-0007 WE PUSHED OPEN THE WIDE GATE AND ENTERED
lbi-6841-88291-0008 ONE STOOD WAITING FOR THEM TO FINISH A SHEAF OF LONG J H STAMPING IRONS IN HIS HAND
lbi-6841-88291-0009 ALL THE REST SQUATTED ON THEIR HEELS ALONG THE FENCE SMOKING CIGARETTES AND CHATTING TOGETHER
lbi-6841-88291-0010 THE FIRST RAYS OF THE SUN SLANTED ACROSS IN ONE GREAT SWEEP FROM THE REMOTE MOUNTAINS
lbi-6841-88291-0011 HOMER WOODEN AND OLD CALIFORNIA JOHN RODE IN AMONG THE CATTLE
lbi-6841-88291-0012 AS THE LOOP SETTLED HE JERKED SHARPLY UPWARD EXACTLY AS ONE WOULD STRIKE TO HOOK A BIG FISH
lbi-6841-88291-0013 HOMER WRAPPED THE ROPE TWICE OR THRICE ABOUT THE HORN AND SAT OVER IN ONE STIRRUP TO AVOID THE TIGHTENED LINE AND TO PRESERVE THE BALANCE
lbi-6841-88291-0014 NOBODY PAID ANY ATTENTION TO THE CALF
lbi-6841-88291-0015 BEHIND HIM FOLLOWED HIS ANXIOUS MOTHER HER HEAD SWINGING FROM SIDE TO SIDE NEAR THE FIRE THE HORSE STOPPED
lbi-6841-88291-0016 THE TWO BULL DOGGERS IMMEDIATELY POUNCED UPON THE VICTIM
lbi-6841-88291-0017 IT WAS PROMPTLY FLOPPED OVER ON ITS RIGHT SIDE
lbi-6841-88291-0018 THUS THE CALF WAS UNABLE TO STRUGGLE
lbi-6841-88291-0019 WHEN ONCE YOU HAVE HAD THE WIND KNOCKED OUT OF YOU OR A RIB OR TWO BROKEN YOU CEASE TO THINK THIS UNNECESSARILY ROUGH
lbi-6841-88291-0020 HOT IRON YELLED ONE OF THE BULL DOGGERS
lbi-6841-88291-0021 MARKER YELLED THE OTHER
lbi-6841-88291-0022 THE BRANDER PRESSED THE IRON SMOOTHLY AGAINST THE FLANK
lbi-6841-88291-0023 PERHAPS THE CALF BLATTED A LITTLE AS THE HEAT SCORCHED
lbi-6841-88291-0024 THE BRAND SHOWED CHERRY WHICH IS THE PROPER COLOUR TO INDICATE DUE PEELING AND A SUCCESSFUL MARK
lbi-6841-88291-0025 THEN HE NICKED OUT A SWALLOW TAIL IN THE OTHER
lbi-6841-88291-0026 IT SEEMS TO ME THAT A GREAT DEAL OF UNNECESSARY TWADDLE IS ABROAD AS TO THE EXTREME CRUELTY OF BRANDING
lbi-6841-88291-0027 UNDOUBTEDLY IT IS TO SOME EXTENT PAINFUL AND COULD SOME OTHER METHOD OF READY IDENTIFICATION BE DEVISED IT MIGHT BE AS WELL TO ADOPT IT IN PREFERENCE
lbi-6841-88291-0028 INEXTINGUISHABLE LAUGHTER FOLLOWED THE SPREAD OF THIS DOCTRINE THROUGH ARIZONA
lbi-6841-88291-0029 IMAGINE A PUNCHER DESCENDING TO EXAMINE POLITELY THE EAR TAGS OF WILD CATTLE ON THE OPEN RANGE OR IN A ROUND UP
lbi-6841-88291-0030 A CALF USUALLY BELLOWS WHEN THE IRON BITES BUT AS SOON AS RELEASED HE ALMOST INVARIABLY GOES TO FEEDING OR TO LOOKING IDLY ABOUT
lbi-6841-88291-0031 BESIDES WHICH IT HAPPENS BUT ONCE IN A LIFETIME AND IS OVER IN TEN SECONDS A COMFORT DENIED TO THOSE OF US WHO HAVE OUR TEETH FILLED
lbi-6841-88291-0032 ONE OF THE LITTLE ANIMALS WAS BUT A FEW MONTHS OLD SO THE RIDER DID NOT BOTHER WITH ITS HIND LEGS BUT TOSSED HIS LOOP OVER ITS NECK
lbi-6841-88291-0033 MISTER FROST'S BULL CALF ALONE IN PICTORIAL HISTORY SHOWS THE ATTITUDES
lbi-6841-88291-0034 AND THEN OF COURSE THERE WAS THE GORGEOUS CONTRAST BETWEEN ALL THIS FRANTIC AND UNCOMPREHENDING EXCITEMENT AND THE ABSOLUTE MATTER OF FACT IMPERTURBABILITY OF HORSE AND RIDER
lbi-6841-88291-0035 AS HE KNEW HIS BUSINESS AND AS THE CALF WAS A SMALL ONE THE LITTLE BEAST WENT OVER PROMPTLY BIT THE GROUND WITH A WHACK AND WAS POUNCED UPON AND HELD
lbi-6841-88291-0036 HE WOULD CATCH HIMSELF ON ONE FOOT SCRAMBLE VIGOROUSLY AND END BY STRUGGLING BACK TO THE UPRIGHT
lbi-6841-88291-0037 YOU CAN IMAGINE WHAT HAPPENED NEXT
lbi-6841-88291-0038 THIS IS PRODUCTIVE OF SOME FUN IF IT FAILS
lbi-6841-88291-0039 BY NOW THE BRANDING WAS IN FULL SWING
lbi-6841-88291-0040 WHEN THE NOOSES FELL THEY TURNED AND WALKED TOWARD THE FIRE AS A MATTER OF COURSE RARELY DID THE CAST FAIL
lbi-6841-88291-0041 MEN RAN TO AND FRO BUSY AND INTENT
lbi-6841-88291-0042 SOMETIMES THREE OR FOUR CALVES WERE ON THE GROUND AT ONCE
lbi-6841-88291-0043 DUST EDDIED AND DISSIPATED
lbi-6841-88291-0044 NO MORE NECKED CALVES THEY ANNOUNCED
lbi-6841-88291-0045 THEN HE WOULD SPIT ON HIS HANDS AND GO AT IT ALONE
lbi-6841-88291-0046 IF LUCK ATTENDED HIS FIRST EFFORT HIS SARCASM WAS PROFOUND THERE'S YORE LITTLE CALF SAID HE
lbi-6841-88291-0047 WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE ME TOTE IT TO YOU OR DO YOU RECKON YOU COULD TODDLE THIS FAR WITH YORE LITTLE OLD IRON
lbi-6841-88291-0048 TOWARD NOON THE WORK SLACKED
lbi-6841-88291-0049 FINALLY HOMER RODE OVER TO THE CATTLEMAN AND REPORTED THE BRANDING FINISHED
lbi-6841-88291-0050 THE LATTER COUNTED THE MARKS IN HIS TALLY BOOK
lbi-6841-88291-0051 ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX HE ANNOUNCED
lbi-6841-88291-0052 THE MARKERS SQUATTED ON THEIR HEELS TOLD OVER THE BITS OF EARS THEY HAD SAVED
lbi-6841-88291-0053 THE TOTAL AMOUNTED TO BUT AN HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE
lbi-6841-88291-0054 FINALLY WOODEN DISCOVERED IT IN HIS HIP POCKET
lbi-6841-88291-0055 THEY HAD BEEN DOING A WRESTLER'S HEAVY WORK ALL THE MORNING BUT DID NOT SEEM TO BE TIRED
lbi-6841-88291-0056 I SAW ONCE IN SOME CRANK PHYSICAL CULTURE PERIODICAL THAT A COWBOY'S LIFE WAS PHYSICALLY ILL BALANCED LIKE AN OARSMAN'S IN THAT IT EXERCISED ONLY CERTAIN MUSCLES OF THE BODY
lbi-6841-88294-0000 AT THIS MOMENT THE HEAVY BEAT OF THE STORM ON THE ROOF CEASED WITH MIRACULOUS SUDDENNESS LEAVING THE OUTSIDE WORLD EMPTY OF SOUND SAVE FOR THE DRIP DRIP DRIP OF EAVES
lbi-6841-88294-0001 WE HAD EVERY SORT OF PEOPLE WITH US OFF AND ON AND AS I WAS LOOKOUT AT A POPULAR GAME I SAW THEM ALL
lbi-6841-88294-0002 AT THE SAME INSTANT I HEARD THE RIP OF STEEL THROUGH CLOTH AND FELT A SHARP STAB IN MY LEFT LEG
lbi-6841-88294-0003 THEN I SCOUTED TO SEE WHAT HAD CUT ME AND FOUND THAT THE FELLOW HAD LOST A HAND
lbi-6841-88294-0004 IN PLACE OF IT HE WORE A SHARP STEEL HOOK
lbi-6841-88294-0005 THERE WAS NO DOUBT OF HIS BEING ALIVE FOR HE WAS BREATHING HARD LIKE A MAN DOES WHEN HE GETS HIT OVER THE HEAD IT DIDN'T SOUND GOOD
lbi-6841-88294-0006 WHEN A MAN BREATHES THAT WAY HE'S MOSTLY ALL GONE
lbi-6841-88294-0007 MEN GOT BATTED OVER THE HEAD OFTEN ENOUGH IN THOSE DAYS
lbi-6841-88294-0008 SOUR WINE IS FINE TO PUT A WOUND IN SHAPE TO HEAL BUT IT'S NO SOOTHING SYRUP
lbi-6841-88294-0009 THEIR COFFIN WAS THEIR SHIP AND THEIR GRAVE IT WAS THE SEA BLOW HIGH BLOW LOW WHAT CARE WE AND THE QUARTER THAT WE GAVE THEM WAS TO SINK THEM IN THE SEA DOWN ON THE COAST OF THE HIGH BARBAREE
lbi-6841-88294-0010 IT FAIR MADE MY HAIR RISE TO HEAR HIM WITH THE BIG STILL SOLEMN DESERT OUTSIDE AND THE QUIET MOONLIGHT AND THE SHADOWS AND HIM SITTING UP STRAIGHT AND GAUNT HIS EYES BLAZING EACH SIDE HIS BIG EAGLE NOSE AND HIS SNAKY HAIR HANGING OVER THE RAW CUT ACROSS HIS HEAD
lbi-6841-88294-0011 HOWEVER I MADE OUT TO GET HIM BANDAGED UP AND IN SHAPE AND PRETTY SOON HE SORT OF WENT TO SLEEP
lbi-6841-88294-0012 THEN AGAIN HE'D SING THAT BARBAREE SONG UNTIL I'D GO OUT AND LOOK AT THE OLD COLORADO FLOWING BY JUST TO BE SURE I HADN'T DIED AND GONE BELOW OR ELSE HE'D JUST TALK
lbi-6841-88294-0013 HE BEGAN WHEN HE WAS A KID AND HE GAVE HIS SIDE OF CONVERSATIONS PAUSING FOR REPLIES
lbi-6841-88294-0014 I USED TO LISTEN BY THE HOUR BUT I NEVER MADE OUT ANYTHING REALLY IMPORTANT AS TO WHO THE MAN WAS OR WHERE HE'D COME FROM OR WHAT HE'D DONE
lbi-6841-88294-0015 I DIDN'T PAY ANY ATTENTION TO HIM FOR HE WAS QUIET
lbi-6841-88294-0016 USUALLY I DIDN'T BOTHER WITH HIS TALK FOR IT DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING BUT SOMETHING IN HIS VOICE MADE ME TURN
lbi-6841-88294-0017 HE WAS LYING ON HIS SIDE THOSE BLACK EYES OF HIS BLAZING AT ME BUT NOW BOTH OF THEM SAW THE SAME DISTANCE
lbi-6841-88294-0018 WHERE ARE MY CLOTHES HE ASKED VERY INTENSE
lbi-6841-88294-0019 ONE LITTLE SQUEEZE TALK ABOUT YOUR DEADLY WEAPONS
lbi-6841-88294-0020 BUT HE'D BEEN TOO SICK AND TOO LONG ABED
lbi-6841-88294-0021 IN A MINUTE OR SO HE CAME TO
lbi-6841-88294-0022 NOW YOU'RE A NICE SWEET PROPOSITION SAID I AS SOON AS I WAS SURE HE COULD UNDERSTAND ME
lbi-6841-88294-0023 THEY'RE SAFE ENOUGH LET ME HAVE THEM HE BEGGED
lbi-6841-88294-0024 NOW LOOK HERE SAID I YOU CAN'T GET UP TO DAY YOU AIN'T FIT
lbi-6841-88294-0025 I KNOW HE PLEADED BUT LET ME SEE THEM
lbi-6841-88294-0026 JUST TO SATISFY HIM I PASSED OVER HIS OLD DUDS
lbi-6841-88294-0027 I'VE BEEN ROBBED HE CRIED
lbi-6841-88294-0028 WHERE'S MY COAT HE ASKED
lbi-6841-88294-0029 YOU HAD NO COAT WHEN I PICKED YOU UP I REPLIED
lbi-6841-88294-0030 HE LOOKED AT ME MIGHTY SUSPICIOUS BUT DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING MORE HE WOULDN'T EVEN ANSWER WHEN I SPOKE TO HIM
lbi-6841-88294-0031 AFTER HE'D EATEN A FAIR MEAL HE FELL ASLEEP
lbi-6841-88294-0032 WHEN I CAME BACK THAT EVENING THE BUNK WAS EMPTY AND HE WAS GONE
lbi-6841-88294-0033 I DIDN'T SEE HIM AGAIN FOR TWO DAYS
lbi-6841-88294-0034 THEN I CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM QUITE A WAYS OFF
lbi-6841-88294-0035 GUESS HE SUSPICIONS I STOLE THAT OLD COAT OF HIS THINKS I AND AFTERWARDS I FOUND THAT MY SURMISE HAD BEEN CORRECT
lbi-6841-88294-0036 HOWEVER HE DIDN'T STAY LONG IN THAT FRAME OF MIND
lbi-6841-88294-0037 I RAN UP PULLING MY GUN
lbi-6841-88294-0038 THE MEX WAS FLAT ON HIS FACE HIS ARMS STRETCHED OUT
lbi-6841-88294-0039 ON THE MIDDLE OF HIS BACK KNELT MY ONE ARMED FRIEND
lbi-6841-88294-0040 ANYWAY I THRUST THE MUZZLE OF MY COLT'S INTO THE SAILOR'S FACE WHAT'S THIS I ASKED
lbi-6841-88294-0041 I WEEN HEEM AT MONTE OFF ANTONIO CURVEZ SAID HE
lbi-6841-88294-0042 THE GLEAM DIED FROM HIS EYE THE SNARL LEFT HIS LIPS
lbi-6841-88294-0043 IN ANY CASE HE FLEW POCO PRONTO LEAVING ME AND MY FRIEND TOGETHER
lbi-6841-88294-0044 DURING THE NEXT TWO MONTHS HE WAS A GOOD DEAL ABOUT TOWN MOSTLY DOING ODD JOBS I SAW HIM OFF AND ON
lbi-6841-88294-0045 HOWEVER I DIDN'T PAY MUCH ATTENTION TO THAT BEING AT THE TIME ALMIGHTY BUSY HOLDING DOWN MY CARD GAMES
lbi-6841-88294-0046 THAT'S ALL RIGHT SAID I BUT YOU BETTER STAY RIGHT THERE
lbi-6841-88294-0047 I WANT TO MAKE UP TO YOU FOR YOUR TROUBLE SAID HE
lbi-6841-88294-0048 WHAT KIND OF A GOOD THING I ASKED TREASURE SAID HE
lbi-6841-88294-0049 HE LOOKED ALL RIGHT ENOUGH NEITHER DRUNK NOR LOCO
lbi-6841-88294-0050 SIT DOWN SAID I OVER THERE THE OTHER SIDE THE TABLE
lbi-6841-88294-0051 HE DID SO NOW FIRE AWAY SAID I
lbi-6841-88294-0052 AND IT'S A BIG THING SAID HANDY SOLOMON TO ME FOR THEY'S NOT ONLY GOLD BUT ALTAR JEWELS AND DIAMONDS
lbi-6841-88294-0053 IT WILL MAKE US RICH AND A DOZEN LIKE US AND YOU CAN KISS THE BOOK ON THAT
lbi-6841-88294-0054 THAT MAY ALL BE TRUE SAID I BUT WHY DO YOU TELL ME
lbi-6841-88294-0055 WHY DON'T YOU GET YOUR TREASURE WITHOUT THE NEED OF DIVIDING IT
lbi-6841-88294-0056 WHY MATE HE ANSWERED IT'S JUST PLAIN GRATITUDE
lbi-6841-88294-0057 DIDN'T YOU SAVE MY LIFE AND NUSS ME AND TAKE CARE OF ME WHEN I WAS NIGH KILLED
lbi-6841-88294-0058 LOOK HERE ANDERSON OR HANDY SOLOMON OR WHATEVER YOU PLEASE TO CALL YOURSELF I REJOINED TO THIS IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO BUSINESS WITH ME AND I DO NOT UNDERSTAND YET JUST WHAT IT IS YOU WANT OF ME YOU'LL HAVE TO TALK STRAIGHT
lbi-6841-88294-0059 IT'S ALL VERY WELL TO SAY GRATITUDE BUT THAT DON'T GO WITH ME
lbi-6841-88294-0060 THE DEVIL'S A PREACHER IF YOU AIN'T LOST YOUR PINFEATHERS SAID HE
lbi-6841-88294-0061 WELL IT'S THIS THEN I GOT TO HAVE A BOAT TO GET THERE AND SHE MUST BE STOCKED
lbi-6841-88294-0062 AND I GOT TO HAVE HELP WITH THE TREASURE IF IT'S LIKE THIS FELLOW SAID IT WAS
lbi-6841-88294-0063 IT'S MONEY I GOT TO HAVE AND IT'S MONEY I HAVEN'T GOT AND CAN'T GET UNLESS I LET SOMEBODY IN AS PARDNER
lbi-6841-88294-0064 WHY ME I ASKED WHY NOT HE RETORTED
lbi-6841-88294-0065 WE TALKED THE MATTER OVER AT LENGTH
lbi-6841-88294-0066 I STOOD OUT FOR A LARGER PARTY
lbi-6841-88294-0067 HE STRONGLY OPPOSED THIS AS DEPRECIATING THE SHARES BUT I HAD NO INTENTION OF GOING ALONE INTO WHAT WAS THEN CONSIDERED A WILD AND DANGEROUS COUNTRY FINALLY WE COMPROMISED
lbi-6841-88294-0068 A THIRD OF THE TREASURE WAS TO GO TO HIM A THIRD TO ME AND THE REST WAS TO BE DIVIDED AMONG THE MEN WHOM I SHOULD SELECT THIS SCHEME DID NOT APPEAL TO HIM
lbi-700-122866-0000 JUNIOR AVONLEA FOUND IT HARD TO SETTLE DOWN TO HUMDRUM EXISTENCE AGAIN
lbi-700-122866-0001 PERHAPS AFTER A WHILE I'LL GET USED TO IT BUT I'M AFRAID CONCERTS SPOIL PEOPLE FOR EVERYDAY LIFE
lbi-700-122866-0002 I SUPPOSE THAT IS WHY MARILLA DISAPPROVES OF THEM
lbi-700-122866-0003 I FEEL JUST NOW THAT I MAY GROW UP TO BE SENSIBLE YET
lbi-700-122866-0004 I JUST LAY AWAKE AND IMAGINED THE CONCERT OVER AND OVER AGAIN
lbi-700-122866-0005 EVENTUALLY HOWEVER AVONLEA SCHOOL SLIPPED BACK INTO ITS OLD GROOVE AND TOOK UP ITS OLD INTERESTS
lbi-700-122866-0006 NONE OF THE SLOANES WOULD HAVE ANY DEALINGS WITH THE BELLS BECAUSE THE BELLS HAD DECLARED THAT THE SLOANES HAD TOO MUCH TO DO IN THE PROGRAM AND THE SLOANES HAD RETORTED THAT THE BELLS WERE NOT CAPABLE OF DOING THE LITTLE THEY HAD TO DO PROPERLY
lbi-700-122866-0007 THE WINTER WEEKS SLIPPED BY
lbi-700-122866-0008 ON ANNE'S BIRTHDAY THEY WERE TRIPPING LIGHTLY DOWN IT KEEPING EYES AND EARS ALERT AMID ALL THEIR CHATTER FOR MISS STACY HAD TOLD THEM THAT THEY MUST SOON WRITE A COMPOSITION ON A WINTER'S WALK IN THE WOODS AND IT BEHOOVED THEM TO BE OBSERVANT
lbi-700-122866-0009 I CAN SCARCELY REALIZE THAT I'M IN MY TEENS
lbi-700-122866-0010 IT'S A GREAT COMFORT TO THINK THAT I'LL BE ABLE TO USE BIG WORDS THEN WITHOUT BEING LAUGHED AT
lbi-700-122866-0011 RUBY GILLIS THINKS OF NOTHING BUT BEAUS SAID ANNE DISDAINFULLY
lbi-700-122866-0012 SHE'S ACTUALLY DELIGHTED WHEN ANYONE WRITES HER NAME UP IN A TAKE NOTICE FOR ALL SHE PRETENDS TO BE SO MAD
lbi-700-122866-0013 I'M TRYING TO BE AS MUCH LIKE MISSUS ALLAN AS I POSSIBLY CAN FOR I THINK SHE'S PERFECT
lbi-700-122866-0014 IF I HAD ALICE BELL'S CROOKED NOSE SAID ANNE DECIDEDLY I WOULDN'T BUT THERE
lbi-700-122866-0015 I'M AFRAID I THINK TOO MUCH ABOUT MY NOSE EVER SINCE I HEARD THAT COMPLIMENT ABOUT IT LONG AGO
lbi-700-122866-0016 OH DIANA LOOK THERE'S A RABBIT
lbi-700-122866-0017 THEY'RE SO WHITE AND STILL AS IF THEY WERE ASLEEP AND DREAMING PRETTY DREAMS
lbi-700-122866-0018 I WROTE IT LAST MONDAY EVENING
lbi-700-122866-0019 IT'S CALLED THE JEALOUS RIVAL OR IN DEATH NOT DIVIDED
lbi-700-122866-0020 I READ IT TO MARILLA AND SHE SAID IT WAS STUFF AND NONSENSE
lbi-700-122866-0021 IT'S A SAD SWEET STORY
lbi-700-122866-0022 CORDELIA WAS A REGAL BRUNETTE WITH A CORONET OF MIDNIGHT HAIR AND DUSKLY FLASHING EYES
lbi-700-122866-0023 YOU KNOW SO MUCH MORE THAN YOU DID WHEN YOU WERE ONLY TWELVE
lbi-700-122866-0024 THEY GREW IN BEAUTY SIDE BY SIDE UNTIL THEY WERE SIXTEEN
lbi-700-122866-0025 I ASKED RUBY GILLIS IF SHE KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT HOW MEN PROPOSED BECAUSE I THOUGHT SHE'D LIKELY BE AN AUTHORITY ON THE SUBJECT HAVING SO MANY SISTERS MARRIED
lbi-700-122866-0026 BUT SHE PRETENDED TO BE GERALDINE'S FRIEND THE SAME AS EVER
lbi-700-122866-0027 LET YOU AND ME HAVE A STORY CLUB ALL OUR OWN AND WRITE STORIES FOR PRACTICE
lbi-700-122866-0028 YOU OUGHT TO CULTIVATE YOUR IMAGINATION YOU KNOW MISS STACY SAYS SO
lbi-700-122866-0029 ONLY WE MUST TAKE THE RIGHT WAY
lbi-700-122866-0030 THIS WAS HOW THE STORY CLUB CAME INTO EXISTENCE
lbi-700-122866-0031 NO BOYS WERE ALLOWED IN IT ALTHOUGH RUBY GILLIS OPINED THAT THEIR ADMISSION WOULD MAKE IT MORE EXCITING AND EACH MEMBER HAD TO PRODUCE ONE STORY A WEEK
lbi-700-122866-0032 EACH GIRL HAS TO READ HER STORY OUT LOUD AND THEN WE TALK IT OVER
lbi-700-122866-0033 MINE IS ROSAMOND MONTMORENCY ALL THE GIRLS DO PRETTY WELL
lbi-700-122866-0034 I'M SURE THAT MUST HAVE A WHOLESOME EFFECT
lbi-700-122866-0035 THE MORAL IS THE GREAT THING MISTER ALLAN SAYS SO
lbi-700-122866-0036 I READ ONE OF MY STORIES TO HIM AND MISSUS ALLAN AND THEY BOTH AGREED THAT THE MORAL WAS EXCELLENT
lbi-700-122866-0037 JANE AND RUBY ALMOST ALWAYS CRY WHEN I COME TO THE PATHETIC PARTS
lbi-700-122866-0038 MISS JOSEPHINE BARRY WROTE BACK THAT SHE HAD NEVER READ ANYTHING SO AMUSING IN HER LIFE
lbi-700-122866-0039 I'M SURE MISSUS ALLAN WAS NEVER SUCH A SILLY FORGETFUL LITTLE GIRL AS YOU ARE
lbi-700-122866-0040 I FELT SO ENCOURAGED WHEN I HEARD THAT
lbi-700-122866-0041 MISSUS LYNDE SAYS SHE ALWAYS FEELS SHOCKED WHEN SHE HEARS OF ANYONE EVER HAVING BEEN NAUGHTY NO MATTER HOW SMALL THEY WERE
lbi-700-122866-0042 NOW I WOULDN'T HAVE FELT THAT WAY
lbi-700-122867-0000 VANITY AND VEXATION OF SPIRIT
lbi-700-122867-0001 THE SPRING WAS ABROAD IN THE LAND AND MARILLA'S SOBER MIDDLE AGED STEP WAS LIGHTER AND SWIFTER BECAUSE OF ITS DEEP PRIMAL GLADNESS
lbi-700-122867-0002 I MUST SAY WITH ALL HER FAULTS I NEVER FOUND HER DISOBEDIENT OR UNTRUSTWORTHY BEFORE AND I'M REAL SORRY TO FIND HER SO NOW
lbi-700-122867-0003 PERHAPS YOU'RE JUDGING HER TOO HASTY MARILLA
lbi-700-122867-0004 OF COURSE I KNEW YOU'D TAKE HER PART MATTHEW BUT I'M BRINGING HER UP NOT YOU
lbi-700-122867-0005 DEMANDED MARILLA ANXIOUSLY GOING OVER TO THE BED
lbi-700-122867-0006 ANNE COWERED DEEPER INTO HER PILLOWS AS IF DESIROUS OF HIDING HERSELF FOREVER FROM MORTAL EYES NO
lbi-700-122867-0007 GET RIGHT UP THIS MINUTE AND TELL ME
lbi-700-122867-0008 THIS MINUTE I SAY THERE NOW WHAT IS IT
lbi-700-122867-0009 ANNE HAD SLID TO THE FLOOR IN DESPAIRING OBEDIENCE
lbi-700-122867-0010 YES IT'S GREEN MOANED ANNE
lbi-700-122867-0011 I THOUGHT NOTHING COULD BE AS BAD AS RED HAIR
lbi-700-122867-0012 YOU HAVEN'T GOT INTO ANY SCRAPE FOR OVER TWO MONTHS AND I WAS SURE ANOTHER ONE WAS DUE
lbi-700-122867-0013 NOW THEN WHAT DID YOU DO TO YOUR HAIR
lbi-700-122867-0014 ANNE SHIRLEY DIDN'T YOU KNOW IT WAS A WICKED THING TO DO
lbi-700-122867-0015 YES I KNEW IT WAS A LITTLE WICKED ADMITTED ANNE
lbi-700-122867-0016 I KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO HAVE YOUR WORD DOUBTED
lbi-700-122867-0017 AND MISSUS ALLAN SAYS WE SHOULD NEVER SUSPECT ANYONE OF NOT TELLING US THE TRUTH UNLESS WE HAVE PROOF THAT THEY'RE NOT
lbi-700-122867-0018 BUT I HADN'T THEN AND I BELIEVED EVERY WORD HE SAID IMPLICITLY
lbi-700-122867-0019 WHO SAID WHO ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
lbi-700-122867-0020 OH I DIDN'T LET HIM IN THE HOUSE
lbi-700-122867-0021 IN A TRICE I SAW MYSELF WITH BEAUTIFUL RAVEN BLACK HAIR AND THE TEMPTATION WAS IRRESISTIBLE
lbi-700-122867-0022 OH MARILLA WHAT A TANGLED WEB WE WEAVE WHEN FIRST WE PRACTICE TO DECEIVE
lbi-700-122867-0023 YOUR HAIR MUST BE CUT OFF THERE IS NO OTHER WAY YOU CAN'T GO OUT WITH IT LOOKING LIKE THAT
lbi-700-122867-0024 WITH A DISMAL SIGH SHE WENT FOR THE SCISSORS
lbi-700-122867-0025 BUT THERE IS NOTHING COMFORTING IN HAVING YOUR HAIR CUT OFF BECAUSE YOU'VE DYED IT A DREADFUL COLOR IS THERE
lbi-700-122867-0026 I'M GOING TO WEEP ALL THE TIME YOU'RE CUTTING IT OFF IF IT WON'T INTERFERE
lbi-700-122867-0027 IT SEEMS SUCH A TRAGIC THING
lbi-700-122867-0028 ANNE WEPT THEN BUT LATER ON WHEN SHE WENT UPSTAIRS AND LOOKED IN THE GLASS SHE WAS CALM WITH DESPAIR
lbi-700-122867-0029 YES I WILL TOO
lbi-700-122867-0030 I NEVER THOUGHT I WAS VAIN ABOUT MY HAIR OF ALL THINGS BUT NOW I KNOW I WAS IN SPITE OF ITS BEING RED BECAUSE IT WAS SO LONG AND THICK AND CURLY
lbi-700-122867-0031 I EXPECT SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN TO MY NOSE NEXT
lbi-700-122867-0032 ANNE'S CLIPPED HEAD MADE A SENSATION IN SCHOOL ON THE FOLLOWING MONDAY BUT TO HER RELIEF NOBODY GUESSED THE REAL REASON FOR IT NOT EVEN JOSIE PYE WHO HOWEVER DID NOT FAIL TO INFORM ANNE THAT SHE LOOKED LIKE A PERFECT SCARECROW
lbi-700-122867-0033 IT'S HARD TO BE TOLD YOU LOOK LIKE A SCARECROW AND I WANTED TO SAY SOMETHING BACK BUT I DIDN'T
lbi-700-122867-0034 IT MAKES YOU FEEL VERY VIRTUOUS WHEN YOU FORGIVE PEOPLE DOESN'T IT
lbi-700-122867-0035 I MEAN TO DEVOTE ALL MY ENERGIES TO BEING GOOD AFTER THIS AND I SHALL NEVER TRY TO BE BEAUTIFUL AGAIN
lbi-700-122867-0036 OF COURSE IT'S BETTER TO BE GOOD
lbi-700-122867-0037 I DO REALLY WANT TO BE GOOD MARILLA LIKE YOU AND MISSUS ALLAN AND MISS STACY AND GROW UP TO BE A CREDIT TO YOU
lbi-700-122867-0038 DIANA SAYS WHEN MY HAIR BEGINS TO GROW TO TIE A BLACK VELVET RIBBON AROUND MY HEAD WITH A BOW AT ONE SIDE
lbi-700-122867-0039 I WILL CALL IT A SNOOD THAT SOUNDS SO ROMANTIC
lbi-700-122867-0040 MY HEAD IS BETTER NOW
lbi-700-122867-0041 IT WAS TERRIBLE BAD THIS AFTERNOON THOUGH
lbi-700-122868-0000 OF COURSE YOU MUST BE ELAINE ANNE SAID DIANA
lbi-700-122868-0001 OF COURSE IT WOULD BE ROMANTIC CONCEDED JANE ANDREWS BUT I KNOW I COULDN'T KEEP STILL
lbi-700-122868-0002 BUT IT'S SO RIDICULOUS TO HAVE A REDHEADED ELAINE MOURNED ANNE
lbi-700-122868-0003 AND ELAINE WAS THE LILY MAID
lbi-700-122868-0004 YOUR COMPLEXION IS JUST AS FAIR AS RUBY'S SAID DIANA EARNESTLY AND YOUR HAIR IS EVER SO MUCH DARKER THAN IT USED TO BE BEFORE YOU CUT IT
lbi-700-122868-0005 IT WAS SPLENDID TO FISH FOR TROUT OVER THE BRIDGE AND THE TWO GIRLS LEARNED TO ROW THEMSELVES ABOUT IN THE LITTLE FLAT BOTTOMED DORY MISTER BARRY KEPT FOR DUCK SHOOTING
lbi-700-122868-0006 IT WAS ANNE'S IDEA THAT THEY DRAMATIZE ELAINE
lbi-700-122868-0007 THOSE DAYS SHE SAID WERE SO MUCH MORE ROMANTIC THAN THE PRESENT
lbi-700-122868-0008 THEY HAD OFTEN GONE DOWN LIKE THIS AND NOTHING COULD BE MORE CONVENIENT FOR PLAYING ELAINE
lbi-700-122868-0009 THE BLACK SHAWL HAVING BEEN PROCURED ANNE SPREAD IT OVER THE FLAT AND THEN LAY DOWN ON THE BOTTOM WITH CLOSED EYES AND HANDS FOLDED OVER HER BREAST
lbi-700-122868-0010 IT SPOILS THE EFFECT BECAUSE THIS IS HUNDREDS OF YEARS BEFORE MISSUS LYNDE WAS BORN
lbi-700-122868-0011 JANE YOU ARRANGE THIS
lbi-700-122868-0012 IT'S SILLY FOR ELAINE TO BE TALKING WHEN SHE'S DEAD
lbi-700-122868-0013 JANE ROSE TO THE OCCASION
lbi-700-122868-0014 LEFT BEHIND AT THE LANDING
lbi-700-122868-0015 ANNE GAVE ONE GASPING LITTLE SCREAM WHICH NOBODY EVER HEARD SHE WAS WHITE TO THE LIPS BUT SHE DID NOT LOSE HER SELF POSSESSION
lbi-700-122868-0016 THERE WAS ONE CHANCE JUST ONE
lbi-700-122868-0017 UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES YOU DON'T THINK MUCH ABOUT MAKING A FLOWERY PRAYER
lbi-700-122868-0018 THE FLAT DRIFTED UNDER THE BRIDGE AND THEN PROMPTLY SANK IN MIDSTREAM
lbi-700-122868-0019 RUBY JANE AND DIANA ALREADY AWAITING IT ON THE LOWER HEADLAND SAW IT DISAPPEAR BEFORE THEIR VERY EYES AND HAD NOT A DOUBT BUT THAT ANNE HAD GONE DOWN WITH IT
lbi-700-122868-0020 THE MINUTES PASSED BY EACH SEEMING AN HOUR TO THE UNFORTUNATE LILY MAID
lbi-700-122868-0021 WHY DIDN'T SOMEBODY COME WHERE HAD THE GIRLS GONE
lbi-700-122868-0022 HER IMAGINATION BEGAN TO SUGGEST ALL MANNER OF GRUESOME POSSIBILITIES TO HER
lbi-700-122868-0023 ANNE SHIRLEY
lbi-700-122868-0024 HOW ON EARTH DID YOU GET THERE HE EXCLAIMED
lbi-700-122868-0025 IT WAS CERTAINLY EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO BE DIGNIFIED UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES
lbi-700-122868-0026 WHAT HAS HAPPENED ANNE
lbi-700-122868-0027 ASKED GILBERT TAKING UP HIS OARS
lbi-700-122868-0028 WE WERE PLAYING ELAINE EXPLAINED ANNE FRIGIDLY WITHOUT EVEN LOOKING AT HER RESCUER AND I HAD TO DRIFT DOWN TO CAMELOT IN THE BARGE I MEAN THE FLAT
lbi-700-122868-0029 FOR A MOMENT ANNE HESITATED
lbi-700-122868-0030 HER HEART GAVE A QUICK QUEER LITTLE BEAT
lbi-700-122868-0031 HER RESENTMENT WHICH TO OTHER AND OLDER PEOPLE MIGHT BE AS LAUGHABLE AS ITS CAUSE WAS IN NO WHIT ALLAYED AND SOFTENED BY TIME SEEMINGLY
lbi-700-122868-0032 NO SHE SAID COLDLY I SHALL NEVER BE FRIENDS WITH YOU GILBERT BLYTHE AND I DON'T WANT TO BE
lbi-700-122868-0033 ALL RIGHT
lbi-700-122868-0034 I'LL NEVER ASK YOU TO BE FRIENDS AGAIN ANNE SHIRLEY AND I DON'T CARE EITHER
lbi-700-122868-0035 OF COURSE HE HAD INSULTED HER TERRIBLY BUT STILL
lbi-700-122868-0036 EVERYTHING I DO GETS ME OR MY DEAREST FRIENDS INTO A SCRAPE
lbi-700-122868-0037 ANNE'S PRESENTIMENT PROVED MORE TRUSTWORTHY THAN PRESENTIMENTS ARE APT TO DO
lbi-700-122868-0038 WILL YOU EVER HAVE ANY SENSE ANNE GROANED MARILLA
lbi-700-122868-0039 I DON'T SEE HOW SAID MARILLA
lbi-700-122868-0040 EVER SINCE I CAME TO GREEN GABLES I'VE BEEN MAKING MISTAKES AND EACH MISTAKE HAS HELPED TO CURE ME OF SOME GREAT SHORTCOMING
lbi-7601-101619-0000 OUR EXTREMEST PLEASURE HAS SOME SORT OF GROANING AND COMPLAINING IN IT WOULD YOU NOT SAY THAT IT IS DYING OF PAIN
lbi-7601-101619-0001 THE HIGHEST AND FULLEST CONTENTMENT OFFERS MORE OF THE GRAVE THAN OF THE MERRY IPSA FELICITAS SE NISI TEMPERAT PREMIT EVEN FELICITY UNLESS IT MODERATE ITSELF OPPRESSES
lbi-7601-101619-0002 SOCRATES SAYS THAT SOME GOD TRIED TO MIX IN ONE MASS AND TO CONFOUND PAIN AND PLEASURE BUT NOT BEING ABLE TO DO IT HE BETHOUGHT HIM AT LEAST TO COUPLE THEM BY THE TAIL METRODORUS SAID THAT IN SORROW THERE IS SOME MIXTURE OF PLEASURE
lbi-7601-101619-0003 NATURE DISCOVERS THIS CONFUSION TO US PAINTERS HOLD THAT THE SAME MOTIONS AND GRIMACES OF THE FACE THAT SERVE FOR WEEPING SERVE FOR LAUGHTER TOO AND INDEED BEFORE THE ONE OR THE OTHER BE FINISHED DO BUT OBSERVE THE PAINTER'S MANNER OF HANDLING AND YOU WILL BE IN DOUBT TO WHICH OF THE TWO THE DESIGN TENDS AND THE EXTREME OF LAUGHTER DOES AT LAST BRING TEARS
lbi-7601-101619-0004 AND THEREFORE COMMON AND LESS SPECULATIVE SOULS ARE FOUND TO BE MORE PROPER FOR AND MORE SUCCESSFUL IN THE MANAGEMENT OF AFFAIRS AND THE ELEVATED AND EXQUISITE OPINIONS OF PHILOSOPHY UNFIT FOR BUSINESS THIS SHARP VIVACITY OF SOUL AND THE SUPPLE AND RESTLESS VOLUBILITY ATTENDING IT DISTURB OUR NEGOTIATIONS
lbi-7601-101619-0005 HE WHO DIVES INTO AND IN HIS INQUISITION COMPREHENDS ALL CIRCUMSTANCES AND CONSEQUENCES HINDERS HIS ELECTION A LITTLE ENGINE WELL HANDLED IS SUFFICIENT FOR EXECUTIONS WHETHER OF LESS OR GREATER WEIGHT
lbi-7601-101622-0000 THE ROMANS BY THIS MEANS ERECTED THEIR COLONIES FOR PERCEIVING THEIR CITY TO GROW IMMEASURABLY POPULOUS THEY EASED IT OF THE MOST UNNECESSARY PEOPLE AND SENT THEM TO INHABIT AND CULTIVATE THE LANDS CONQUERED BY THEM SOMETIMES ALSO THEY PURPOSELY MAINTAINED WARS WITH SOME OF THEIR ENEMIES NOT ONLY TO KEEP THEIR OWN MEN IN ACTION FOR FEAR LEST IDLENESS THE MOTHER OF CORRUPTION SHOULD BRING UPON THEM SOME WORSE INCONVENIENCE
lbi-7601-101622-0001 AND WE SUFFER THE ILLS OF A LONG PEACE LUXURY IS MORE PERNICIOUS THAN WAR
lbi-7601-101622-0002 AND THIS ALSO WAS ONE REASON WHY OUR KING PHILIP CONSENTED TO SEND HIS SON JOHN UPON A FOREIGN EXPEDITION THAT HE MIGHT TAKE ALONG WITH HIM A GREAT NUMBER OF HOT YOUNG MEN WHO WERE THEN IN HIS PAY
lbi-7601-101622-0003 WHAT OTHER END DOES THE IMPIOUS ART OF THE GLADIATORS PROPOSE TO ITSELF WHAT THE SLAUGHTER OF YOUNG MEN WHAT PLEASURE FED WITH BLOOD
lbi-7601-101622-0004 PRINCE TAKE THE HONOURS DELAYED FOR THY REIGN AND BE SUCCESSOR TO THY FATHERS HENCEFORTH LET NONE AT ROME BE SLAIN FOR SPORT
lbi-7601-101622-0005 LET BEASTS BLOOD STAIN THE INFAMOUS ARENA AND NO MORE HOMICIDES BE THERE ACTED
lbi-7601-101622-0006 IT WAS NOT ENOUGH FOR THEM TO FIGHT AND TO DIE BRAVELY BUT CHEERFULLY TOO INSOMUCH THAT THEY WERE HISSED AND CURSED IF THEY MADE ANY HESITATION ABOUT RECEIVING THEIR DEATH
lbi-7601-101622-0007 THE VERY GIRLS THEMSELVES SET THEM ON
lbi-7601-175351-0000 BEGINNING OF REVOLT
lbi-7601-175351-0001 AT THIS UNEXPECTED COMMAND THE SURPRISE WAS GREAT ON BOARD THE FORWARD
lbi-7601-175351-0002 LIGHT THE FIRES EXCLAIMED SOME
lbi-7601-175351-0003 WHAT WITH ASKED OTHERS
lbi-7601-175351-0004 AND STUFF THE STOVE WITH THE MASTS ADDED WARREN
lbi-7601-175351-0005 DID YOU HEAR ME
lbi-7601-175351-0006 WHO SPOKE CRIED HATTERAS
lbi-7601-175351-0007 I DID SAID PEN ADVANCING TOWARDS THE CAPTAIN
lbi-7601-175351-0008 I SAY ANSWERED PEN WITH AN OATH I SAY WE'VE HAD ENOUGH OF IT AND WE WON'T GO ANY FURTHER
lbi-7601-175351-0009 YOU SHAN'T KILL US WITH HUNGER AND WORK IN THE WINTER AND THEY SHAN'T LIGHT THE FIRES
lbi-7601-175351-0010 IF YOU REPEAT WHAT THE MAN SAYS ANSWERED HATTERAS I'LL HAVE YOU SHUT UP IN YOUR CABIN AND GUARDED
lbi-7601-175351-0011 A MURMUR WAS HEARD
lbi-7601-175351-0012 THE ENGINEER FOLLOWED BY PLOVER AND WARREN WENT DOWN TO HIS POST
lbi-7601-175351-0013 THE STEAM WAS SOON GOT UP THE ANCHORS WERE WEIGHED AND THE FORWARD VEERED AWAY EAST CUTTING THE YOUNG ICE WITH HER STEEL PROW
lbi-7601-175351-0014 BETWEEN BARING ISLAND AND BEECHER POINT THERE ARE A CONSIDERABLE QUANTITY OF ISLANDS IN THE MIDST OF ICE FIELDS THE STREAMS CROWD TOGETHER IN THE LITTLE CHANNELS WHICH CUT UP THIS PART OF THE SEA THEY HAD A TENDENCY TO AGGLOMERATE UNDER THE RELATIVELY LOW TEMPERATURE HUMMOCKS WERE FORMED HERE AND THERE AND THESE MASSES ALREADY MORE COMPACT DENSER AND CLOSER TOGETHER WOULD SOON FORM AN IMPENETRABLE MASS
lbi-7601-175351-0015 I AM BEGINNING NOT TO ANSWERED WALL
lbi-7601-175351-0016 HATTERAS STILL HOPED TO FIND AN OPEN SEA BEYOND THE SEVENTY SEVENTH PARALLEL AS SIR EDWARD BELCHER HAD DONE
lbi-7601-175351-0017 OUGHT HE TO TREAT THESE ACCOUNTS AS APOCRYPHAL
lbi-7601-175351-0018 THE NEXT DAY THE SUN SET FOR THE FIRST TIME ENDING THUS THE LONG SERIES OF DAYS WITH TWENTY FOUR HOURS IN THEM
lbi-7601-175351-0019 THE MEN HAD ENDED BY GETTING ACCUSTOMED TO THE CONTINUAL DAYLIGHT BUT IT HAD NEVER MADE ANY DIFFERENCE TO THE ANIMALS THE GREENLAND DOGS WENT TO THEIR REST AT THEIR ACCUSTOMED HOUR AND DICK SLEPT AS REGULARLY EVERY EVENING AS THOUGH DARKNESS HAD COVERED THE SKY
lbi-7601-175351-0020 THE DOCTOR BY FOLLOWING JOHNSON'S ADVICE ACCUSTOMED HIMSELF TO SUPPORT THE LOW TEMPERATURE HE ALMOST ALWAYS STAYED ON DECK BRAVING THE COLD THE WIND AND THE SNOW
lbi-7601-175351-0021 THERE'S MORE THAN ONE AMONGST US WHO WOULD LIKE TO IMITATE THEM I THINK
lbi-7601-175351-0022 THEY ARE COWARDS MISTER CLAWBONNY THOSE ANIMALS HAVE NO PROVISIONS AS WE HAVE AND ARE OBLIGED TO SEEK THEIR FOOD WHERE IT IS TO BE FOUND
lbi-7601-175351-0023 YOU HOPE THAT HATTERAS WILL SUCCEED THEN
lbi-7601-175351-0024 HE CERTAINLY WILL MISTER CLAWBONNY
lbi-7601-175351-0025 I AM OF THE SAME OPINION AS YOU JOHNSON AND IF HE ONLY WANTED ONE FAITHFUL COMPANION HE'LL HAVE TWO
lbi-7601-175351-0026 PRINCE ALBERT LAND WHICH THE FORWARD WAS THEN COASTING BEARS ALSO THE NAME OF GRINNELL LAND AND THOUGH HATTERAS FROM HIS HATRED TO THE YANKEES WOULD NEVER CALL IT BY ITS AMERICAN NAME IT IS THE ONE IT GENERALLY GOES BY
lbi-7601-175351-0027 ON THE EIGHTEENTH OF AUGUST THEY SIGHTED BRITANNIA MOUNTAIN SCARCELY VISIBLE THROUGH THE MIST AND THE FORWARD WEIGHED ANCHOR THE NEXT DAY IN NORTHUMBERLAND BAY
lbi-7601-291468-0000 WHEN THE LOFTY THUCYDIDES IS ABOUT TO ENTER UPON HIS DESCRIPTION OF THE PLAGUE THAT DESOLATED ATHENS ONE OF HIS MODERN COMMENTATORS ASSURES THE READER THAT THE HISTORY IS NOW GOING TO BE EXCEEDINGLY SOLEMN SERIOUS AND PATHETIC AND HINTS WITH THAT AIR OF CHUCKLING GRATULATION WITH WHICH A GOOD DAME DRAWS FORTH A CHOICE MORSEL FROM A CUPBOARD TO REGALE A FAVORITE THAT THIS PLAGUE WILL GIVE HIS HISTORY A MOST AGREEABLE VARIETY
lbi-7601-291468-0001 SUCH ARE THE TRUE SUBJECTS FOR THE HISTORIC PEN
lbi-7601-291468-0002 THE FALL OF EMPIRES THE DESOLATION OF HAPPY COUNTRIES SPLENDID CITIES SMOKING IN THEIR RUINS THE PROUDEST WORKS OF ART TUMBLED IN THE DUST THE SHRIEKS AND GROANS OF WHOLE NATIONS ASCENDING UNTO HEAVEN
lbi-7601-291468-0003 THUS THOSE SWARMS OF FLIES WHICH ARE SO OFTEN EXECRATED AS USELESS VERMIN ARE CREATED FOR THE SUSTENANCE OF SPIDERS AND SPIDERS ON THE OTHER HAND ARE EVIDENTLY MADE TO DEVOUR FLIES
lbi-7601-291468-0004 ANCIENT TRADITIONS SPEAK MUCH OF HIS LEARNING AND OF THE GALLANT INROADS HE HAD MADE INTO THE DEAD LANGUAGES IN WHICH HE HAD MADE CAPTIVE A HOST OF GREEK NOUNS AND LATIN VERBS AND BROUGHT OFF RICH BOOTY IN ANCIENT SAWS AND APOPHTHEGMS WHICH HE WAS WONT TO PARADE IN HIS PUBLIC HARANGUES AS A TRIUMPHANT GENERAL OF YORE HIS SPOLIA OPIMA
lbi-7601-291468-0005 IT WAS OBSERVED HOWEVER THAT HE SELDOM GOT INTO AN ARGUMENT WITHOUT GETTING INTO A PERPLEXITY AND THEN INTO A PASSION WITH HIS ADVERSARY FOR NOT BEING CONVINCED GRATIS
lbi-7601-291468-0006 HIS ABODE WHICH HE HAD FIXED AT A BOWERY OR COUNTRY SEAT AT A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE CITY JUST AT WHAT IS NOW CALLED DUTCH STREET SOON ABOUNDED WITH PROOFS OF HIS INGENUITY PATENT SMOKE JACKS THAT REQUIRED A HORSE TO WORK THEM DUTCH OVENS THAT ROASTED MEAT WITHOUT FIRE CARTS THAT WENT BEFORE THE HORSES WEATHERCOCKS THAT TURNED AGAINST THE WIND AND OTHER WRONG HEADED CONTRIVANCES THAT ASTONISHED AND CONFOUNDED ALL BEHOLDERS
lbi-7601-291468-0007 IT IS IN KNOWLEDGE AS IN SWIMMING HE WHO FLOUNDERS AND SPLASHES ON THE SURFACE MAKES MORE NOISE AND ATTRACTS MORE ATTENTION THAN THE PEARL DIVER WHO QUIETLY DIVES IN QUEST OF TREASURES TO THE BOTTOM
lbi-7641-96252-0000 THUS WHEN DOGMAS LEAD IT WHAT THE MAN REALLY AND IN GENERAL WILLS REMAINS STILL THE SAME
lbi-7641-96252-0001 FOR THESE ARE CAREFUL ONLY FOR THEMSELVES FOR THEIR OWN EGOISM JUST LIKE THE BANDIT FROM WHOM THEY ARE ONLY DISTINGUISHED BY THE ABSURDITY OF THEIR MEANS
lbi-7641-96252-0002 THE DEEDS AND CONDUCT OF AN INDIVIDUAL AND OF A NATION MAY BE VERY MUCH MODIFIED THROUGH DOGMAS EXAMPLE AND CUSTOM
lbi-7641-96252-0003 WITH AN EQUAL DEGREE OF WICKEDNESS ONE MAN MAY DIE ON THE WHEEL AND ANOTHER IN THE BOSOM OF HIS FAMILY
lbi-7641-96252-0004 IT IS CONCEIVABLE THAT A PERFECT STATE OR PERHAPS INDEED A COMPLETE AND FIRMLY BELIEVED DOCTRINE OF REWARDS AND PUNISHMENTS AFTER DEATH MIGHT PREVENT EVERY CRIME POLITICALLY MUCH WOULD BE GAINED THEREBY MORALLY NOTHING ONLY THE EXPRESSION OF THE WILL IN LIFE WOULD BE RESTRICTED
lbi-7641-96252-0005 WE WHO HERE SEEK THE THEORY OF VIRTUE AND HAVE THEREFORE ALSO TO EXPRESS ABSTRACTLY THE NATURE OF THE KNOWLEDGE WHICH LIES AT ITS FOUNDATION WILL YET BE UNABLE TO CONVEY THAT KNOWLEDGE ITSELF IN THIS EXPRESSION
lbi-7641-96252-0006 HE SEES THAT THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN HIMSELF AND OTHERS WHICH TO THE BAD MAN IS SO GREAT A GULF ONLY BELONGS TO A FLEETING AND ILLUSIVE PHENOMENON
lbi-7641-96252-0007 HE RECOGNISES HIMSELF HIS WILL IN EVERY BEING AND CONSEQUENTLY ALSO IN THE SUFFERER
lbi-7641-96252-0008 BUT THE LATTER IS THE NECESSARY AND INEVITABLE SYMPTOM OF THAT KNOWLEDGE
lbi-7641-96252-0009 THE OPPOSITE OF THE STING OF CONSCIENCE THE ORIGIN AND SIGNIFICANCE OF WHICH IS EXPLAINED ABOVE IS THE GOOD CONSCIENCE THE SATISFACTION WHICH WE EXPERIENCE AFTER EVERY DISINTERESTED DEED
lbi-7641-96252-0010 THE GOOD MAN LIVES IN A WORLD OF FRIENDLY INDIVIDUALS THE WELL BEING OF ANY OF WHOM HE REGARDS AS HIS OWN
lbi-7641-96252-0011 THEREFORE ALTHOUGH THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE LOT OF MANKIND GENERALLY DOES NOT MAKE HIS DISPOSITION A JOYFUL ONE YET THE PERMANENT KNOWLEDGE OF HIS OWN NATURE IN ALL LIVING BEINGS GIVES HIM A CERTAIN EVENNESS AND EVEN SERENITY OF DISPOSITION
lbi-7641-96252-0012 FOR THE INTEREST WHICH IS EXTENDED TO INNUMERABLE MANIFESTATIONS CANNOT CAUSE SUCH ANXIETY AS THAT WHICH IS CONCENTRATED UPON ONE
lbi-7641-96252-0013 THE ACCIDENTS WHICH CONCERN INDIVIDUALS COLLECTIVELY EQUALISE THEMSELVES WHILE THOSE WHICH HAPPEN TO THE PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL CONSTITUTE GOOD OR BAD FORTUNE
lbi-7641-96252-0014 THUS THOUGH OTHERS HAVE SET UP MORAL PRINCIPLES WHICH THEY GIVE OUT AS PRESCRIPTIONS FOR VIRTUE AND LAWS WHICH IT WAS NECESSARY TO FOLLOW I AS HAS ALREADY BEEN SAID CANNOT DO THIS BECAUSE I HAVE NO OUGHT OR LAW TO PRESCRIBE TO THE ETERNALLY FREE WILL
lbi-7641-96252-0015 FURTHER THAN THIS IT CANNOT GO FOR THERE EXISTS NO REASON FOR PREFERRING THE INDIVIDUALITY OF ANOTHER TO ITS OWN
lbi-7641-96252-0016 YET THE NUMBER OF OTHER INDIVIDUALS WHOSE WHOLE HAPPINESS OR LIFE IS IN DANGER MAY OUTWEIGH THE REGARD FOR ONE'S OWN PARTICULAR WELL BEING
lbi-7641-96252-0017 SO DIED SOCRATES AND GIORDANO BRUNO AND SO MANY A HERO OF THE TRUTH SUFFERED DEATH AT THE STAKE AT THE HANDS OF THE PRIESTS
lbi-7641-96252-0018 WEEPING IS ACCORDINGLY SYMPATHY WITH OUR OWN SELVES OR SYMPATHY DIRECTED BACK ON ITS SOURCE
lbi-7641-96252-0019 IT IS THEREFORE CONDITIONAL UPON THE CAPACITY FOR LOVE AND SYMPATHY AND ALSO UPON IMAGINATION
lbi-7641-96252-0020 WHEN WE ARE MOVED TO TEARS NOT THROUGH OUR OWN SUFFERING BUT THROUGH THAT OF ANOTHER THIS HAPPENS AS FOLLOWS
lbi-7641-96252-0021 EITHER WE VIVIDLY PUT OURSELVES IN THE PLACE OF THE SUFFERER BY IMAGINATION OR SEE IN HIS FATE THE LOT OF HUMANITY AS A WHOLE AND CONSEQUENTLY FIRST OF ALL OUR OWN LOT AND THUS IN A VERY ROUNDABOUT WAY IT IS YET ALWAYS ABOUT OURSELVES THAT WE WEEP SYMPATHY WITH OURSELVES WHICH WE FEEL THIS SEEMS TO BE THE PRINCIPAL REASON OF THE UNIVERSAL AND THUS NATURAL WEEPING IN THE CASE OF DEATH
lbi-7641-96252-0022 FIRST OF ALL HE CERTAINLY WEEPS FOR THE FATE OF THE DEAD BUT HE ALSO WEEPS WHEN AFTER LONG HEAVY AND INCURABLE SUFFERING DEATH WAS TO THIS MAN A WISHED FOR DELIVERANCE
lbi-7641-96670-0000 THEY WERE IN THE LAND THIS PEOPLE SAID BEFORE THE MOON HAD COME INTO THE SKY
lbi-7641-96670-0001 AND MANY OF THE MAGICIANS OF EGYPT WHO HAD COME WITH KING SESOSTRIS STAYED IN THAT CITY OF AEA AND THEY TAUGHT PEOPLE SPELLS THAT COULD STAY THE MOON IN HER GOING AND COMING IN HER RISING AND SETTING
lbi-7641-96670-0002 MEDEA TOO HIS WISE DAUGHTER KNEW THE SECRETS TAUGHT BY THOSE WHO COULD SWAY THE MOON
lbi-7641-96670-0003 FOR JASON WAS THE GRANDSON OF CRETHEUS AND CRETHEUS WAS THE BROTHER OF ATHAMAS THEIR GRANDFATHER
lbi-7641-96670-0004 JASON TOOK PELEUS AND TELAMON WITH HIM
lbi-7641-96670-0005 AS THEY CAME TO THE CITY A MIST FELL AND JASON AND HIS COMRADES WITH THE SONS OF PHRIXUS WENT THROUGH THE CITY WITHOUT BEING SEEN
lbi-7641-96670-0006 THE MIST LIFTED AND BEFORE THE HEROES WAS THE WONDER OF THE PALACE IN THE BRIGHT LIGHT OF THE MORNING
lbi-7641-96670-0007 ON EACH SIDE OF THE COURTYARD WERE THE PALACE BUILDINGS IN ONE KING A EETES LIVED WITH APSYRTUS HIS SON AND IN THE OTHER CHALCIOPE AND MEDEA LIVED WITH THEIR HANDMAIDENS
lbi-7641-96670-0008 AND THEN A DOVE FLEW TOWARD HER IT WAS BEING CHASED BY A HAWK AND MEDEA SAW THE HAWK'S EYES AND BEAK
lbi-7641-96670-0009 WE PULLED AWAY FROM THAT PLACE AND THEREAFTER WE WERE DRIVEN BY THE WINDS BACK TO THE MOUTH OF THE PHASIS
lbi-7641-96670-0010 WITH HIM THERE CAME THE MIGHTIEST OF THE HEROES OF GREECE
lbi-7641-96670-0011 ALREADY HE HAS HEARD OF YOUR BITTER FOES THE SAUROMATAE
lbi-7641-96670-0012 HE WITH HIS COMRADES WOULD SUBDUE THEM FOR YOU
lbi-7641-96670-0013 A EETES'S HEART WAS FILLED WITH WRATH AS HE LOOKED UPON THEM AND HIS EYES SHONE AS A LEOPARD'S EYES
lbi-7641-96670-0014 AND THEN SPEAKING TO THE KING IN A QUIET VOICE JASON SAID
lbi-7641-96670-0015 HIS HEART WAS DIVIDED AS TO WHETHER HE SHOULD SUMMON HIS ARMED MEN AND HAVE THEM SLAIN UPON THE SPOT OR WHETHER HE SHOULD PUT THEM INTO DANGER BY THE TRIAL HE WOULD MAKE OF THEM
lbi-7641-96670-0016 IT MAY BE THAT YE ARE TRULY OF THE SEED OF THE IMMORTALS
lbi-7641-96670-0017 AND IT MAY BE THAT I SHALL GIVE YOU THE GOLDEN FLEECE TO BEAR AWAY AFTER I HAVE MADE TRIAL OF YOU
lbi-7641-96670-0018 SHE ENTERED SOFTLY AND SHE STOOD AWAY FROM HER FATHER AND THE FOUR WHO WERE SPEAKING WITH HIM
lbi-7641-96670-0019 SHE HAD A DARK FACE THAT WAS MADE VERY STRANGE BY HER CROWN OF GOLDEN HAIR
lbi-7641-96670-0020 KNOW THAT ON THE PLAIN OF ARES YONDER I HAVE TWO FIRE BREATHING BULLS WITH FEET OF BRASS
lbi-7641-96670-0021 THEN I SOWED THE FURROWS NOT WITH THE SEED THAT DEMETER GIVES BUT WITH TEETH OF A DRAGON
lbi-7641-96670-0022 IF YOU CAN ACCOMPLISH THIS THAT I ACCOMPLISHED IN DAYS GONE BY I SHALL SUBMIT TO YOU AND GIVE YOU THE GOLDEN FLEECE
lbi-7641-96670-0023 BUT IF YOU CANNOT ACCOMPLISH WHAT I ONCE ACCOMPLISHED YOU SHALL GO FROM MY CITY EMPTY HANDED FOR IT IS NOT RIGHT THAT A BRAVE MAN SHOULD YIELD AUGHT TO ONE WHO CANNOT SHOW HIMSELF AS BRAVE
lbi-7641-96670-0024 THEN JASON UTTERLY CONFOUNDED CAST HIS EYES UPON THE GROUND
lbi-7641-96670-0025 I WILL DARE THIS CONTEST MONSTROUS AS IT IS
lbi-7641-96670-0026 AS HE SAID THIS HE SAW THE EYES OF MEDEA GROW WIDE AS WITH FEAR
lbi-7641-96670-0027 PHRONTIS AND MELAS WENT TO WHERE THEIR MOTHER WAS
lbi-7641-96684-0000 AND AS A MORTAL APOLLO SOUGHT TO EARN HIS BREAD AMONGST MEN
lbi-7641-96684-0001 AFTERWARD PEOPLE WONDERED AT ADMETUS'S EVER SMILING FACE AND EVER RADIANT BEING
lbi-7641-96684-0002 THAT WAS BEFORE ADMETUS SAILED ON THE ARGO WITH JASON AND THE COMPANIONS OF THE QUEST
lbi-7641-96684-0003 THEREAFTER ADMETUS HAVING THE LOVE OF ALCESTIS WAS EVEN MORE HAPPY THAN HE HAD BEEN BEFORE
lbi-7641-96684-0004 A RADIANT FIGURE IT WAS AND ADMETUS KNEW THAT THIS WAS APOLLO COME TO HIM AGAIN
lbi-7641-96684-0005 BUT APOLLO TURNED TO ADMETUS A FACE THAT WAS WITHOUT JOY
lbi-7641-96684-0006 WHAT YEARS OF HAPPINESS HAVE BEEN MINE O APOLLO THROUGH YOUR FRIENDSHIP FOR ME SAID ADMETUS
lbi-7641-96684-0007 BUT STILL APOLLO STOOD BEFORE HIM WITH A FACE THAT WAS WITHOUT JOY
lbi-7641-96684-0008 HE SPOKE AND HIS VOICE WAS NOT THAT CLEAR AND VIBRANT VOICE THAT HE HAD ONCE IN SPEAKING TO ADMETUS
lbi-7641-96684-0009 ADMETUS ADMETUS HE SAID IT IS FOR ME TO TELL YOU THAT YOU MAY NO MORE LOOK ON THE BLUE SKY NOR WALK UPON THE GREEN EARTH
lbi-7641-96684-0010 IT IS FOR ME TO TELL YOU THAT THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD WILL HAVE YOU COME TO HIM ADMETUS ADMETUS KNOW THAT EVEN NOW THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD IS SENDING DEATH FOR YOU
lbi-7641-96684-0011 IF ONE WILL GO WILLINGLY IN THY PLACE WITH DEATH THOU CANST STILL LIVE ON GO ADMETUS
lbi-7641-96684-0012 AND THEN HE CAME UPON AN ANCIENT WOMAN WHO SAT UPON STONES IN THE COURTYARD GRINDING CORN BETWEEN TWO STONES
lbi-7641-96684-0013 THERE SHE WAS SITTING AS HE HAD FIRST KNOWN HER WITH HER EYES BLEARED AND HER KNEES SHAKING AND WITH THE DUST OF THE COURTYARD AND THE HUSKS OF THE CORN IN HER MATTED HAIR
lbi-7641-96684-0014 HE WENT TO HER AND SPOKE TO HER AND HE ASKED HER TO TAKE THE PLACE OF THE KING AND GO WITH DEATH
lbi-7641-96684-0015 BUT WHEN SHE HEARD THE NAME OF DEATH HORROR CAME INTO THE FACE OF THE ANCIENT WOMAN AND SHE CRIED OUT THAT SHE WOULD NOT LET DEATH COME NEAR HER
lbi-7641-96684-0016 ADMETUS TOOK THE MAN'S SHRIVELED HAND AND HE ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD NOT TAKE THE KING'S PLACE AND GO WITH DEATH THAT WAS COMING FOR HIM
lbi-7641-96684-0017 THEN ADMETUS WENT INTO THE PALACE AND INTO THE CHAMBER WHERE HIS BED WAS AND HE LAY DOWN UPON THE BED AND HE LAMENTED THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO GO WITH DEATH THAT WAS COMING FOR HIM FROM THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD AND HE LAMENTED THAT NONE OF THE WRETCHED ONES AROUND THE PALACE WOULD TAKE HIS PLACE
lbi-7641-96684-0018 ONE SHOULD GO IN YOUR PLACE FOR YOU ARE THE KING AND HAVE MANY GREAT AFFAIRS TO ATTEND TO
lbi-7641-96684-0019 NOW THE FOOTSTEPS SEEMED TO STOP
lbi-7641-96684-0020 IT WAS NOT SO TERRIBLE FOR HIM AS BEFORE
lbi-7641-96684-0021 AND THE WORDS HE HAD SPOKEN HE WOULD HAVE TAKEN BACK THE WORDS THAT HAD BROUGHT HER CONSENT TO GO WITH DEATH IN HIS PLACE
lbi-7641-96684-0022 DEATH WOULD SOON BE HERE FOR HER
lbi-7641-96684-0023 NO NOT HERE FOR HE WOULD NOT HAVE DEATH COME INTO THE PALACE
lbi-7641-96684-0024 HE LIFTED ALCESTIS FROM THE BED AND HE CARRIED HER FROM THE PALACE
lbi-7641-96684-0025 NO MORE SPEECH CAME FROM HER
lbi-7641-96684-0026 AND AS FOR ADMETUS HE WENT WITHIN THE CHAMBER AND KNELT BESIDE THE BED ON WHICH ALCESTIS HAD LAIN AND THOUGHT OF HIS TERRIBLE LOSS
lbi-7641-96684-0027 TO WHAT GOD IS THAT SACRIFICE DUE
lbi-7641-96684-0028 AND THEN HERACLES FELT THAT ANOTHER LABOR WAS BEFORE HIM
lbi-7641-96684-0029 I HAVE DRAGGED UP FROM THE UNDERWORLD HE THOUGHT THE HOUND THAT GUARDS THOSE WHOM DEATH BRINGS DOWN INTO THE REALM OF THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD
lbi-7641-96684-0030 WHY SHOULD I NOT STRIVE WITH DEATH
lbi-7641-96684-0031 AND WHAT A NOBLE THING IT WOULD BE TO BRING BACK THIS FAITHFUL WOMAN TO HER HOUSE AND TO HER HUSBAND
lbi-7641-96684-0032 HE LEFT THE PALACE OF ADMETUS AND HE WENT TO THE TEMPLE OF THE GODS
lbi-7641-96684-0033 YOU ARE HELD BY ME DEATH AND YOU WILL NOT BE LET GO UNLESS YOU PROMISE TO GO FORTH FROM THIS TEMPLE WITHOUT BRINGING ONE WITH YOU
lbi-7641-96684-0034 AND DEATH KNOWING THAT HERACLES COULD HOLD HIM THERE AND THAT THE BUSINESS OF THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD WOULD BE LEFT UNDONE IF HE WERE HELD PROMISED THAT HE WOULD LEAVE THE TEMPLE WITHOUT BRINGING ONE WITH HIM
lbi-7641-96684-0035 SHE WAS VEILED AND ADMETUS COULD NOT SEE HER FEATURES
lbi-7641-96684-0036 HERE IS A WOMAN WHOM I AM BRINGING BACK TO HER HUSBAND I WON HER FROM AN ENEMY
lbi-7641-96684-0037 THIS I CANNOT DO SAID ADMETUS I HAVE HAD PANGS ENOUGH
lbi-7641-96684-0038 THEN ADMETUS RAISED THE VEIL OF THE WOMAN HE HAD TAKEN ACROSS THE THRESHOLD OF HIS HOUSE
lbi-7697-105815-0000 HE NOW WENT ON TILL HE CAME TO THE HOUSE AT THE DOOR OF WHICH HE WAS TO KNOCK THIS HE DID TWO OR THREE TIMES
lbi-7697-105815-0001 CHRISTIAN I HAVE COME TO SEE THE GOOD MAN OF THE HOUSE
lbi-7697-105815-0002 CHRISTIAN SIR I AM COME FROM THE CITY OF DESTRUCTION AND AM ON MY WAY TO MOUNT ZION
lbi-7697-105815-0003 I WAS TOLD BY THE MAN THAT STANDS AT THE GATE THAT IF I CAME HERE YOU WOULD SHOW ME GOOD THINGS THAT WOULD HELP ME
lbi-7697-105815-0004 HE STOOD AS IF HE WOULD PLEAD FOR MEN AND A CROWN OF GOLD HUNG NEAR HIS HEAD
lbi-7697-105815-0005 CHRISTIAN WHAT DOES THIS MEAN
lbi-7697-105815-0006 THEN HE TOOK HIM TO A LARGE ROOM THAT WAS FULL OF DUST FOR IT HAD NOT BEEN SWEPT AND INTERPRETER TOLD HIS MAN TO SWEEP IT
lbi-7697-105815-0007 CHRISTIAN WHAT MEANS THIS
lbi-7697-105815-0008 THEN YOU NEXT SAW THE MAID COME IN TO LAY THE DUST SO IS SIN MADE CLEAN AND LAID LOW BY FAITH IN THE BOOK
lbi-7697-105815-0009 JUST AS CHRISTIAN CAME UP TO THE CROSS HIS LOAD SLID FROM HIS BACK CLOSE TO THE MOUTH OF THE TOMB WHERE IT FELL IN AND I SAW IT NO MORE
lbi-7697-105815-0010 AS HE STOOD THUS AND WEPT LO THREE BRIGHT ONES CAME TO HIM AND ONE OF THEM SAID PEACE BE TO THEE THOU HAST GRACE FROM THY SINS
lbi-7697-105815-0011 CHRISTIAN GAVE THREE LEAPS FOR JOY AND SANG AS HE WENT AH WHAT A PLACE IS THIS BLEST CROSS BLEST TOMB
lbi-7697-105815-0012 HE WENT ON THUS TILL HE CAME TO A VALE WHERE HE SAW THREE MEN WHO WERE IN A SOUND SLEEP WITH CHAINS ON THEIR FEET
lbi-7697-105815-0013 CHRISTIAN SIRS WHENCE COME YOU AND WHERE DO YOU GO
lbi-7697-105815-0014 FORMALIST AND HYPOCRISY WE WERE BORN IN THE LAND OF VAIN GLORY AND ARE ON OUR WAY TO MOUNT ZION FOR PRAISE
lbi-7697-105815-0015 KNOW YOU NOT THAT HE THAT COMES NOT IN AT THE DOOR BUT CLIMBS UP TO GET IN THE SAME IS A THIEF
lbi-7697-105815-0016 THEY TOLD CHRISTIAN THAT HE HAD NO NEED FOR CARE ON THAT SCORE FOR LONG USE HAD MADE IT LAW AND THEY COULD PROVE THAT IT HAD BEEN SO FOR YEARS
lbi-7697-105815-0017 YES SAID THEY NO DOUBT OF IT
lbi-7697-105815-0018 AND IF WE GET IN THE ROAD AT ALL PRAY WHAT ARE THE ODDS
lbi-7697-105815-0019 IS NOT OUR CASE AS GOOD AS YOURS
lbi-7697-105815-0020 I SAW THEN THAT THEY ALL WENT ON TILL THEY CAME TO THE FOOT OF THE HILL OF DIFFICULTY WHERE THERE WAS A SPRING
lbi-7697-105815-0021 NOW WHEN CHRISTIAN GOT AS FAR AS THE SPRING OF LIFE HE DRANK OF IT AND THEN WENT UP THE HILL
lbi-7697-105815-0022 NOW HALF WAY UP WAS A CAVE MADE BY THE LORD OF THAT HILL THAT THOSE WHO CAME BY MIGHT REST THERE
lbi-7697-105815-0023 TIMOROUS SAID THAT ZION WAS THE HILL THEY MEANT TO CLIMB BUT THAT WHEN THEY HAD GOT HALF WAY THEY FOUND THAT THEY MET WITH MORE AND MORE RISK SO THAT GREAT FEAR CAME ON THEM AND ALL THEY COULD DO WAS TO TURN BACK
lbi-7697-105815-0024 YES SAID MISTRUST FOR JUST IN FRONT OF US THERE LAY TWO BEASTS OF PREY IN OUR PATH WE KNEW NOT IF THEY SLEPT OR NOT BUT WE THOUGHT THAT THEY WOULD FALL ON US AND TEAR OUR LIMBS
lbi-7697-105815-0025 YET HE THOUGHT ONCE MORE OF WHAT HE HAD HEARD FROM THE MEN AND THEN HE FELT IN HIS CLOAK FOR HIS SCROLL THAT HE MIGHT READ IT AND FIND SOME PEACE
lbi-7697-105815-0026 HE FELT FOR IT BUT FOUND IT NOT
lbi-7697-105815-0027 SO HE FELL DOWN ON HIS KNEES TO PRAY THAT GOD WOULD GIVE HIM GRACE FOR THIS ACT AND THEN WENT BACK TO LOOK FOR HIS SCROLL
lbi-7697-105815-0028 OH FOOL THAT I AM SAID HE TO SLEEP IN THE DAY TIME SO TO GIVE WAY TO THE FLESH AS TO USE FOR EASE THAT REST WHICH THE LORD OF THE HILL HAD MADE BUT FOR THE HELP OF THE SOUL
lbi-7697-105815-0029 SUCH WAS THE LOT OF THE JEWS FOR THEIR SIN THEY WERE SENT BACK BY THE WAY OF THE RED SEA AND I AM MADE TO TREAD THOSE STEPS WITH GRIEF WHICH I MIGHT HAVE TROD WITH JOY HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THIS SLEEP
lbi-7697-105815-0030 HOW FAR MIGHT I HAVE BEEN ON MY WAY BY THIS TIME
lbi-7697-105815-0031 NOW BY THIS TIME HE HAD COME TO THE VALE ONCE MORE WHERE FOR A SPELL HE SAT DOWN AND WEPT BUT AT LAST AS HE CAST A SAD GLANCE AT THE FOOT OF THE BENCH HE SAW HIS SCROLL WHICH HE CAUGHT UP WITH HASTE AND PUT IN HIS CLOAK
lbi-7697-105815-0032 WORDS ARE TOO WEAK TO TELL THE JOY OF CHRISTIAN WHEN HE HAD GOT BACK HIS SCROLL
lbi-7697-105815-0033 HE LAID IT UP IN THE BREAST OF HIS COAT AND GAVE THANKS TO GOD
lbi-7697-105815-0034 WITH WHAT A LIGHT STEP DID HE NOW CLIMB THE HILL
lbi-7697-105815-0035 AH THOUGHT HE THESE BEASTS RANGE IN THE NIGHT FOR THEIR PREY AND IF THEY SHOULD MEET WITH ME IN THE DARK HOW SHOULD I FLY FROM THEM
lbi-7697-105815-0036 THE NAME OF THE MAN WHO KEPT THE LODGE OF THAT HOUSE WAS WATCHFUL AND WHEN HE SAW THAT CHRISTIAN MADE A HALT AS IF HE WOULD GO BACK HE CAME OUT TO HIM AND SAID IS THY STRENGTH SO SMALL
lbi-7697-105815-0037 FEAR NOT THE TWO WILD BEASTS FOR THEY ARE BOUND BY CHAINS AND ARE PUT HERE TO TRY THE FAITH OF THOSE THAT HAVE IT AND TO FIND OUT THOSE THAT HAVE NONE
lbi-7697-105815-0038 KEEP IN THE MIDST OF THE PATH AND NO HARM SHALL COME TO THEE
lbi-7697-105815-0039 THEN I SAW IN MY DREAM THAT STILL HE WENT ON IN GREAT DREAD OF THE WILD BEASTS HE HEARD THEM ROAR YET THEY DID HIM NO HARM BUT WHEN HE HAD GONE BY THEM HE WENT ON WITH JOY TILL HE CAME AND STOOD IN FRONT OF THE LODGE WHERE WATCHFUL DWELT
lbi-7697-105815-0040 CHRISTIAN SIR WHAT HOUSE IS THIS MAY I REST HERE TO NIGHT
lbi-7697-105815-0041 WHEN WATCHFUL TOLD HER WHY CHRISTIAN HAD COME THERE SHE SAID WHAT IS YOUR NAME
lbi-7697-105815-0042 THEN CHRISTIAN BENT DOWN HIS HEAD AND WENT WITH THEM TO THE HOUSE
lbi-7697-105815-0043 PIETY COME GOOD CHRISTIAN SINCE OUR LOVE PROMPTS US TO TAKE YOU IN TO REST LET US TALK WITH YOU OF ALL THAT YOU HAVE SEEN ON YOUR WAY
lbi-7697-105815-0044 CHRISTIAN WITH A RIGHT GOOD WILL AND I AM GLAD THAT YOU SHOULD ASK IT OF ME
lbi-7697-105815-0045 PRUDENCE AND FIRST SAY WHAT IS IT THAT MAKES YOU WISH SO MUCH TO GO TO MOUNT ZION
lbi-7697-105815-0046 THERE THEY SAY IS NO DEATH AND THERE I SHALL DWELL WITH SUCH AS LOVE THE LORD
lbi-7697-105815-0047 CHARITY HAVE YOU A WIFE AND BABES CHRISTIAN YES I HAVE
lbi-7697-105815-0048 CHARITY AND WHY DID YOU NOT BRING THEM WITH YOU
lbi-7697-105815-0049 BUT THEY WOULD NOT COME WITH ME NOR HAVE ME LEAVE THEM
lbi-7697-105815-0050 THUS DID CHRISTIAN TALK WITH THESE FRIENDS TILL IT GREW DARK AND THEN HE TOOK HIS REST IN A LARGE ROOM THE NAME OF WHICH WAS PEACE THERE HE SLEPT TILL BREAK OF DAY AND THEN HE SANG A HYMN
lbi-7697-105815-0051 AND THEY BROUGHT OUT THE JAW BONE OF AN ASS WITH WHICH SAMSON DID SUCH GREAT FEATS AND THE SLING AND STONE WITH WHICH DAVID SLEW GOLIATH OF GATH
lbi-7697-105815-0052 WHAT IS THE NAME OF THIS LAND SAID CHRISTIAN
lbi-7697-105815-0053 THEN THEY TOLD HIM IT WAS IMMANUEL'S LAND
lbi-7697-105817-0000 MORE THAN THIS HE HATH BEEN HEARD TO RAIL ON YOU MY LORD WHO ARE NOW HIS JUDGE
lbi-7697-105817-0001 JUDGE THY JUST DOOM WOULD BE TO DIE ON THE SPOT STILL LET US HEAR WHAT THOU HAST TO SAY
lbi-7697-105817-0002 THEN THE JUDGE TO SUM UP THE CASE SPOKE THUS YOU SEE THIS MAN WHO HAS MADE SUCH A STIR IN OUR TOWN
lbi-7697-105817-0003 THUS WHILE ONE LOST HIS LIFE FOR THE TRUTH A NEW MAN ROSE FROM HIS DEATH TO TREAD THE SAME WAY WITH CHRISTIAN
lbi-7697-105817-0004 COME GOOD HOPEFUL SAID CHRISTIAN LET US WALK ON THE GRASS
lbi-7697-105817-0005 SO THEY SET OFF THROUGH THE FIELD
lbi-7697-105817-0006 HOPEFUL I HAD MY FEARS FROM THE FIRST AND SO GAVE YOU A HINT CHRISTIAN GOOD FRIEND I GRIEVE THAT I HAVE BROUGHT YOU OUT OF THE RIGHT PATH
lbi-7697-105817-0007 HOPEFUL SAY NO MORE NO DOUBT IT IS FOR OUR GOOD
lbi-7697-105817-0008 CHRISTIAN WE MUST NOT STAND THUS LET US TRY TO GO BACK
lbi-7697-105817-0009 THEN SAID GIANT DESPAIR YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO FORCE YOUR WAY IN HERE THE GROUND ON WHICH YOU LIE IS MINE
lbi-7697-105817-0010 THEY HAD NOT MUCH TO SAY AS THEY KNEW THAT THEY WERE IN FAULT
lbi-7697-105817-0011 AND BY THIS ACT WE KILL OUR SOULS AS WELL
lbi-7697-245712-0000 FOUR WHETHER IN THAT STATE MAN WOULD HAVE BEEN MASTER OVER MEN
lbi-7697-245712-0001 THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN HAD NO MASTERSHIP OF THE ANIMALS
lbi-7697-245712-0002 THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE BEFORE MAN HAD DISOBEYED NOTHING DISOBEYED HIM THAT WAS NATURALLY SUBJECT TO HIM
lbi-7697-245712-0003 SECONDLY THIS IS PROVED BY THE ORDER OF DIVINE PROVIDENCE WHICH ALWAYS GOVERNS INFERIOR THINGS BY THE SUPERIOR
lbi-7697-245712-0004 THIRDLY THIS IS PROVED FROM A PROPERTY OF MAN AND OF OTHER ANIMALS
lbi-7697-245712-0005 NOW WHATEVER IS PARTICIPATED IS SUBJECT TO WHAT IS ESSENTIAL AND UNIVERSAL
lbi-7697-245712-0006 THEREFORE THE SUBJECTION OF OTHER ANIMALS TO MAN IS PROVED TO BE NATURAL
lbi-7697-245712-0007 THEY WOULD NOT HOWEVER ON THIS ACCOUNT HAVE BEEN EXCEPTED FROM THE MASTERSHIP OF MAN AS NEITHER AT PRESENT ARE THEY FOR THAT REASON EXCEPTED FROM THE MASTERSHIP OF GOD WHOSE PROVIDENCE HAS ORDAINED ALL THIS
lbi-7697-245712-0008 THIS IS SIGNIFIED BY THE FACT THAT GOD LED THE ANIMALS TO MAN THAT HE MIGHT GIVE THEM NAMES EXPRESSIVE OF THEIR RESPECTIVE NATURES
lbi-7697-245712-0009 SO ALL ANIMALS WOULD HAVE OBEYED MAN OF THEIR OWN ACCORD AS IN THE PRESENT STATE SOME DOMESTIC ANIMALS OBEY HIM
lbi-7697-245712-0010 OBJECTION ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN WOULD NOT HAVE HAD MASTERSHIP OVER ALL OTHER CREATURES
lbi-7697-245712-0011 MUCH LESS THEREFORE WOULD IT HAVE OBEYED MAN IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE
lbi-7697-245712-0012 THEREFORE SINCE IT IS BY HIS REASON THAT MAN IS COMPETENT TO HAVE MASTERSHIP IT SEEMS THAT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN HAD NO DOMINION OVER PLANTS
lbi-7697-245712-0013 NOW IN MAN REASON HAS THE POSITION OF A MASTER AND NOT OF A SUBJECT
lbi-7697-245712-0014 I ANSWER THAT WE MUST NEEDS ADMIT THAT IN THE PRIMITIVE STATE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN SOME INEQUALITY AT LEAST AS REGARDS SEX BECAUSE GENERATION DEPENDS UPON DIVERSITY OF SEX AND LIKEWISE AS REGARDS AGE FOR SOME WOULD HAVE BEEN BORN OF OTHERS NOR WOULD SEXUAL UNION HAVE BEEN STERILE
lbi-7697-245712-0015 THERE MIGHT ALSO HAVE BEEN BODILY DISPARITY
lbi-7697-245712-0016 INEQUALITY MIGHT ALSO ARISE ON THE PART OF NATURE AS ABOVE DESCRIBED WITHOUT ANY DEFECT OF NATURE
lbi-7697-245712-0017 OBJECTION ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MASTER OVER MAN
lbi-7697-245712-0018 THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO MAN
lbi-7697-245712-0019 IN ANOTHER SENSE MASTERSHIP IS REFERRED IN A GENERAL SENSE TO ANY KIND OF SUBJECT AND IN THIS SENSE EVEN HE WHO HAS THE OFFICE OF GOVERNING AND DIRECTING FREE MEN CAN BE CALLED A MASTER
lbi-7697-245712-0020 SUCH A KIND OF MASTERSHIP WOULD HAVE EXISTED IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE BETWEEN MAN AND MAN FOR TWO REASONS
lbi-7697-245715-0000 BUT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO WEAKNESS OF OLD AGE
lbi-7697-245715-0001 ON THE CONTRARY EVERYTHING GENERATED IS FIRST IMPERFECT BUT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE CHILDREN WOULD HAVE BEEN BEGOTTEN BY GENERATION
lbi-7697-245715-0002 THEREFORE FROM THE FIRST THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPERFECT IN BODILY SIZE AND POWER
lbi-7697-245715-0003 THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE THERE WAS NO NEED FOR WOMEN TO BE BORN ON THE CONTRARY NATURE'S PROCESS IN GENERATION WOULD HAVE BEEN IN HARMONY WITH THE MANNER IN WHICH IT WAS ESTABLISHED BY GOD
lbi-8173-294714-0000 I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT MISTER VAN BRANDT IS IN PRISON FOR DEBT I SAID
lbi-8173-294714-0001 AND I SAW FOR MYSELF LAST NIGHT THAT HE HAD LEFT YOU HELPLESS
lbi-8173-294714-0002 HE LEFT ME THE LITTLE MONEY HE HAD WITH HIM WHEN HE WAS ARRESTED SHE REJOINED SADLY
lbi-8173-294714-0003 HIS CRUEL CREDITORS ARE MORE TO BLAME THAN HE IS FOR THE POVERTY THAT HAS FALLEN ON US
lbi-8173-294714-0004 EVEN THIS NEGATIVE DEFENSE OF VAN BRANDT STUNG ME TO THE QUICK I OUGHT TO HAVE SPOKEN MORE GUARDEDLY OF HIM I SAID BITTERLY
lbi-8173-294714-0005 I OUGHT TO HAVE REMEMBERED THAT A WOMAN CAN FORGIVE ALMOST ANY WRONG THAT A MAN CAN INFLICT ON HER WHEN HE IS THE MAN WHOM SHE LOVES
lbi-8173-294714-0006 SHE PUT HER HAND ON MY MOUTH AND STOPPED ME BEFORE I COULD SAY ANY MORE
lbi-8173-294714-0007 HOW CAN YOU SPEAK SO CRUELLY TO ME SHE ASKED
lbi-8173-294714-0008 YOU KNOW TO MY SHAME I CONFESSED IT TO YOU THE LAST TIME WE MET YOU KNOW THAT MY HEART IN SECRET IS ALL YOURS
lbi-8173-294714-0009 WHAT WRONG ARE YOU TALKING OF
lbi-8173-294714-0010 IS IT THE WRONG I SUFFERED WHEN VAN BRANDT MARRIED ME WITH A WIFE LIVING AT THE TIME AND LIVING STILL
lbi-8173-294714-0011 DO YOU THINK I CAN EVER FORGET THE GREAT MISFORTUNE OF MY LIFE THE MISFORTUNE THAT HAS MADE ME UNWORTHY OF YOU
lbi-8173-294714-0012 IT IS NO FAULT OF MINE GOD KNOWS BUT IT IS NOT THE LESS TRUE THAT I AM NOT MARRIED AND THAT THE LITTLE DARLING WHO IS PLAYING OUT THERE WITH HER DOLL IS MY CHILD
lbi-8173-294714-0013 AND YOU TALK OF MY BEING YOUR WIFE KNOWING THAT THE CHILD ACCEPTS ME AS HER SECOND FATHER I SAID
lbi-8173-294714-0014 IT WOULD BE BETTER AND HAPPIER FOR US BOTH IF YOU HAD AS LITTLE PRIDE AS THE CHILD PRIDE SHE REPEATED
lbi-8173-294714-0015 IN SUCH A POSITION AS MINE
lbi-8173-294714-0016 A HELPLESS WOMAN WITH A MOCK HUSBAND IN PRISON FOR DEBT
lbi-8173-294714-0017 AM I TO MARRY YOU FOR MY FOOD AND SHELTER
lbi-8173-294714-0018 AM I TO MARRY YOU BECAUSE THERE IS NO LAWFUL TIE THAT BINDS ME TO THE FATHER OF MY CHILD
lbi-8173-294714-0019 BAD AS HE IS HE HAS NOT FORSAKEN ME HE HAS BEEN FORCED AWAY
lbi-8173-294714-0020 MY ONLY FRIEND IS IT POSSIBLE THAT YOU THINK ME UNGRATEFUL ENOUGH TO CONSENT TO BE YOUR WIFE
lbi-8173-294714-0021 THE WOMAN IN MY SITUATION MUST BE HEARTLESS INDEED WHO COULD DESTROY YOUR PLACE IN THE ESTIMATION OF THE WORLD AND THE REGARD OF YOUR FRIENDS
lbi-8173-294714-0022 THE WRETCHEDEST CREATURE THAT WALKS THE STREETS WOULD SHRINK FROM TREATING YOU IN THAT WAY
lbi-8173-294714-0023 OH WHAT ARE MEN MADE OF
lbi-8173-294714-0024 HOW CAN YOU HOW CAN YOU SPEAK OF IT
lbi-8173-294714-0025 I YIELDED AND SPOKE OF IT NO MORE
lbi-8173-294714-0026 EVERY WORD SHE UTTERED ONLY INCREASED MY ADMIRATION OF THE NOBLE CREATURE WHOM I HAD LOVED AND LOST
lbi-8173-294714-0027 BITTERLY AS I HATED THE MAN WHO HAD PARTED US I LOVED HER DEARLY ENOUGH TO BE EVEN CAPABLE OF HELPING HIM FOR HER SAKE HOPELESS INFATUATION
lbi-8173-294714-0028 I DON'T DENY IT I DON'T EXCUSE IT HOPELESS INFATUATION YOU HAVE FORGIVEN ME I SAID
lbi-8173-294714-0029 LET ME DESERVE TO BE FORGIVEN
lbi-8173-294714-0030 IT IS SOMETHING TO BE YOUR ONLY FRIEND
lbi-8173-294714-0031 YOU MUST HAVE PLANS FOR THE FUTURE TELL ME UNRESERVEDLY HOW I CAN HELP YOU
lbi-8173-294714-0032 COMPLETE THE GOOD WORK THAT YOU HAVE BEGUN SHE ANSWERED GRATEFULLY HELP ME BACK TO HEALTH
lbi-8173-294714-0033 MAKE ME STRONG ENOUGH TO SUBMIT TO A DOCTOR'S ESTIMATE OF MY CHANCES OF LIVING FOR SOME YEARS YET
lbi-8173-294714-0034 A DOCTOR'S ESTIMATE OF YOUR CHANCES OF LIVING I REPEATED WHAT DO YOU MEAN
lbi-8173-294714-0035 I HARDLY KNOW HOW TO TELL YOU SHE SAID WITHOUT SPEAKING AGAIN OF MISTER VAN BRANDT
lbi-8173-294714-0036 DOES SPEAKING OF HIM AGAIN MEAN SPEAKING OF HIS DEBTS I ASKED
lbi-8173-294714-0037 WHY NEED YOU HESITATE
lbi-8173-294714-0038 YOU KNOW THAT THERE IS NOTHING I WILL NOT DO TO RELIEVE YOUR ANXIETIES
lbi-8173-294714-0039 NEVER LET ME TELL YOU THE PLAIN TRUTH
lbi-8173-294714-0040 THERE IS A SERIOUS NECESSITY FOR HIS GETTING OUT OF PRISON
lbi-8173-294714-0041 YES THIS IS HIS POSITION IN TWO WORDS A LITTLE WHILE SINCE HE OBTAINED AN EXCELLENT OFFER OF EMPLOYMENT ABROAD FROM A RICH RELATIVE OF HIS AND HE HAD MADE ALL HIS ARRANGEMENTS TO ACCEPT IT
lbi-8173-294714-0042 UNHAPPILY HE RETURNED TO TELL ME OF HIS GOOD FORTUNE AND THE SAME DAY HE WAS ARRESTED FOR DEBT
lbi-8173-294714-0043 THE SNARE THAT HAD BEEN SET FOR HER WAS PLAINLY REVEALED IN THOSE FOUR WORDS
lbi-8173-294714-0044 IN THE EYE OF THE LAW SHE WAS OF COURSE A SINGLE WOMAN SHE WAS OF AGE SHE WAS TO ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES HER OWN MISTRESS
lbi-8173-294714-0045 WHAT WAS THERE TO PREVENT HER FROM INSURING HER LIFE IF SHE PLEASED AND FROM SO DISPOSING OF THE INSURANCE AS TO GIVE VAN BRANDT A DIRECT INTEREST IN HER DEATH
lbi-8173-294714-0046 THANKS TO THE HAPPY ACCIDENT OF MY POSITION THE ONE CERTAIN WAY OF PROTECTING HER LAY EASILY WITHIN MY REACH
lbi-8173-294714-0047 I COULD OFFER TO LEND THE SCOUNDREL THE MONEY THAT HE WANTED AT AN HOUR'S NOTICE AND HE WAS THE MAN TO ACCEPT MY PROPOSAL QUITE AS EASILY AS I COULD MAKE IT
lbi-8173-294714-0048 YOU ARE QUITE MISTAKEN I REPLIED
lbi-8173-294714-0049 I AM ONLY DOUBTING WHETHER YOUR PLAN FOR RELIEVING MISTER VAN BRANDT OF HIS EMBARRASSMENTS IS QUITE SO SIMPLE AS YOU SUPPOSE
lbi-8173-294714-0050 ARE YOU AWARE OF THE DELAYS THAT ARE LIKELY TO TAKE PLACE BEFORE IT WILL BE POSSIBLE TO BORROW MONEY ON YOUR POLICY OF INSURANCE
lbi-8173-294714-0051 I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT SHE SAID SADLY
lbi-8173-294714-0052 WILL YOU LET ME ASK THE ADVICE OF MY LAWYERS
lbi-8173-294714-0053 THEY ARE TRUSTWORTHY AND EXPERIENCED MEN AND I AM SURE THEY CAN BE OF USE TO YOU
lbi-8173-294714-0054 CAUTIOUSLY AS I HAD EXPRESSED MYSELF HER DELICACY TOOK THE ALARM
lbi-8173-294714-0055 PROMISE THAT YOU WON'T ASK ME TO BORROW MONEY OF YOU FOR MISTER VAN BRANDT SHE REJOINED AND I WILL ACCEPT YOUR HELP GRATEFULLY
lbi-8173-294714-0056 I COULD HONESTLY PROMISE THAT
lbi-8173-294714-0057 MY ONE CHANCE OF SAVING HER LAY IN KEEPING FROM HER KNOWLEDGE THE COURSE THAT I HAD NOW DETERMINED TO PURSUE
lbi-8173-294714-0058 I ROSE TO GO WHILE MY RESOLUTION STILL SUSTAINED ME
lbi-8173-294714-0059 KISS ME SHE WHISPERED BEFORE YOU GO
lbi-8173-294714-0060 IT IS ONLY YOUR GOODNESS THAT OVERPOWERS ME
lbi-8254-115543-0000 THE NEXT DAY EVERYBODY IN THE HOUSE BEGAN TO MAKE PREPARATIONS FOR THE JOURNEY
lbi-8254-115543-0001 EVERYTHING WAS DONE VERY LEISURELY THOUGH THERE WAS A LOT OF TALKING AND DISPUTING AND THE GIVING OF CONTRARY ORDERS
lbi-8254-115543-0002 THE OLD PORTER WAS THERE DIRECTING AND SCOLDING THE SERVANTS AS THEY PILED THE RUGS AND BLANKETS AND BAGS OF FOOD AND POTS AND PANS AND DISHES INTO THE WAGON
lbi-8254-115543-0003 THERE WAS QUITE A PROCESSION WHEN AT LAST THE BIG WAGON RUMBLED OUT THROUGH THE GATEWAY
lbi-8254-115543-0004 BEHIND IT CAME THE GRANDMOTHER IN HER DHOOLIE DAK A SORT OF A LITTER OR EASY CHAIR SWUNG BETWEEN TWO LONG POLES
lbi-8254-115543-0005 BESIDES THE FAMILY THERE WERE MANY SERVANTS AND SEVERAL OTHERS WALKED BESIDE THE SLOW MOVING WAGON
lbi-8254-115543-0006 THE COOK TOO WENT WITH THEM
lbi-8254-115543-0007 GOOD BYE SHOUTED LITTLE NAO FROM HIS GARDEN WALL AS THEY WENT BY GOOD BYE
lbi-8254-115543-0008 THEY SHOUTED GREETINGS TO THEIR FRIEND THE POTTER AS THEY PASSED HIM AND ALSO TO THE OLD FAKIR SMEARED ALL OVER WITH ASHES WHO SAT IN A LITTLE BRICK HUT BY THE BRIDGE AND PRETENDED TO MAKE WONDERFUL CURES
lbi-8254-115543-0009 THIS IS MORE FUN THAN GOING TO SCHOOL SAID CHOLA AS THE OXEN PLODDED ALONG THROUGH CLOUDS OF DUST
lbi-8254-115543-0010 THESE LOVELY BIRDS ARE FOUND NEARLY EVERYWHERE IN INDIA AND IN SOME PARTS RUN QUITE WILD
lbi-8254-115543-0011 HIS LONG MATTED HAIR HUNG ON HIS SHOULDERS AND HE WAS SAYING HIS PRAYERS WITH THE HELP OF A ROSARY OF BEADS WHICH HE CONTINUALLY PASSED THROUGH HIS HANDS
lbi-8254-115543-0012 AS THE WAGON CAME UP A YOUNG MAN WHO ACCOMPANIED THE HOLY MAN RAN UP AND HELD OUT A BEGGING BOWL SAYING GIVE OH CHARITABLE PEOPLE TO THIS HOLY ONE
lbi-8254-115543-0013 NO COUNTRY IN THE WORLD HAS SO MANY BEGGARS AS INDIA
lbi-8254-115543-0014 MANY OF THEM ARE CALLED HOLY MEN BECAUSE THEY DO NOTHING BUT MAKE PILGRIMAGES FROM ONE SACRED PLACE TO ANOTHER LIVING SOLELY ON THE ALMS THAT ARE GIVEN TO THEM
lbi-8254-115543-0015 WHEN THEY HAD EATEN THEIR LUNCH THE YOUNG PEOPLE WENT TO EXPLORE THE GARDEN NEAR THEM
lbi-8254-115543-0016 PERHAPS THERE ARE DOGS SAID MAHALA A LITTLE FEARFULLY BUT THEY FORGOT ABOUT DOGS WHEN THEY SAW A THICKET OF SUGAR CANE DOWN BY A STREAM
lbi-8254-115543-0017 PERHAPS WE CAN BUY SOME FROM THE MAN THERE HE IS NOW PLOUGHING BY THE STREAM SAID CHOLA
lbi-8254-115543-0018 IT IS LOOKING FOR WATER SAID THE FARMER AS HE TOOK A LONG STALK OF CANE AND GENTLY GUIDED IT DOWN TO THE STREAM
lbi-8254-115543-0019 THE SNAKE IS ANOTHER SACRED ANIMAL OF THE HINDUS AND THEY WOULD NOT KILL OR INJURE ONE FOR ANYTHING
lbi-8254-115543-0020 AS THEY WERE ABOUT TO MOVE ON AGAIN THEY SAW A GREAT CLOUD OF DUST DOWN THE ROAD
lbi-8254-115543-0021 IT TURNED OUT THAT IT WAS A GREAT AND POWERFUL RAJAH GOING IN STATE ON A JOURNEY TO VISIT ANOTHER RAJAH OR RULER OF ONE OF THE SMALL KINGDOMS OR STATES OF WHICH MODERN INDIA WAS FORMERLY MADE UP
lbi-8254-115543-0022 FIRST THERE CAME A BIG ELEPHANT ALL DECORATED WITH SILK AND GOLD AND SILVER
lbi-8254-115543-0023 ON THE ELEPHANT'S BACK WAS A HOWDAH WHICH IS LIKE A BIG CHAIR WITH A CANOPY OVER IT AND IN THIS SITTING CROSS LEGGED WAS THE RAJAH A BIG FAT FELLOW DRESSED IN COLOURED SILKS AND JEWELS WITH A GREAT DIAMOND SET PLUME IN HIS TURBAN
lbi-8254-115543-0024 BEHIND THE HOWDAH STOOD A SERVANT HOLDING A BIG UMBRELLA OF FINE FEATHERS OVER THE RAJAH'S HEAD
lbi-8254-115543-0025 THE DRIVER SAT ON THE NECK OF THE ELEPHANT AND GUIDED THE BIG BEAST BY PRODDING HIM ON ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER WITH AN IRON SHOD STICK OR GOAD
lbi-8254-115543-0026 ISN'T IT FINE TO RIDE LIKE THAT ON A BIG ELEPHANT
lbi-8254-115543-0027 AND ALL THE REST OF THE DAY THE LITTLE FOLK TALKED OF NOTHING BUT THE GREAT RAJAH AND HIS ESCORT
lbi-8254-115543-0028 OUR PARTY CAME TO A HALT AMONG MANY OTHER BULLOCK CARTS THE OWNERS OF WHICH WERE ALREADY SITTING AROUND ON THE GROUND COOKING THEIR SUPPERS OR BARGAINING FOR FOOD AT THE LITTLE BOOTHS
lbi-8254-115543-0029 THESE THEY USED FOR PLATES HEAPING THEM UP WITH THEIR BOILED RICE AND CURRY AND FISH AND ALL SORTS OF PUDDINGS AND SWEETS
lbi-8254-115543-0030 AS SUPPER WAS BEING EATEN ANOTHER PARTY STOPPED AT THE PARAO AND CAMPED NOT FAR AWAY
lbi-8254-115543-0031 WHEN THE LITTER WAS PUT DOWN A YOUNG BOY STEPPED OUT LOOKING VERY PROUD AND HAUGHTY
lbi-8254-115543-0032 HIS SERVANTS AT ONCE SPREAD A HANDSOME RUG ON THE GROUND FOR HIM TO SIT ON AND RUSHED ABOUT WAITING ON HIM TAKING GOOD CARE TO KEEP EVERY ONE AT A DISTANCE
lbi-8254-115543-0033 YES AND HOW HE ORDERS EVERY ONE ABOUT HIM
lbi-8254-115543-0034 AROUND THE LITTLE BRAHMIN'S NECK WAS A THIN CORD OR THREAD WHICH WAS THE SIGN OF HIS HIGH CASTE
lbi-8254-115543-0035 MEANWHILE THE HAUGHTY LITTLE BRAHMIN ATE HIS SUPPER WITH HIS HEAD TURNED AWAY SO NO ONE COULD SEE HIM EAT AND THEN GROWING TIRED OF RESPECTFUL GLANCES OF THE CROWD AROUND HIM HE GOT INTO HIS LITTER AGAIN AND THE SERVANTS FASTENED THE CURTAINS TIGHTLY AROUND HIM
lbi-8254-115543-0036 EVERYBODY SLEPT SOUNDLY IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT ONE OF THE SERVANTS WAS BEATING A DRUM MOST OF THE NIGHT WHICH THEY REALLY BELIEVED WAS THE WAY TO KEEP OFF EVIL SPIRITS
lbi-8254-115543-0037 OH THE THIEVES HE CRIED
lbi-8254-115543-0038 THEY ARE AS BAD AS THE BEGGARS
lbi-8254-115543-0039 WHAT ART THOU GUARDING SO CAREFULLY SHRIYA ASKED HER BROTHER
lbi-8254-115543-0040 HE AND CHOLA WERE WALKING BESIDE THE WAGON FOR A CHANGE
lbi-8254-115543-0041 THE LATTICES WERE RAISED SO SHRIYA AND HER MOTHER AND AUNT COULD ENJOY THE FRESH AIR
lbi-8254-115543-0042 THEY ARE MY DOLLS SAID THE LITTLE GIRL SADLY AS SHE PATTED THE BUNDLE BESIDE HER
lbi-8254-115543-0043 I TAKE THEM AS AN OFFERING TO THE HOLY RIVER POOR LITTLE WOMAN
lbi-8254-115543-0044 MUST THOU SACRIFICE THY TOYS TOO
lbi-8254-115543-0045 SMILED HER UNCLE AS HE PATTED HER HEAD
lbi-8254-84205-0000 CHAPTER FORTY NINE GRIGGS IS STUBBORN
lbi-8254-84205-0001 THE DAYS GLIDED BY WITH THE STIFFNESS IN CHRIS LEE'S LIMBS GROWING LESS PAINFUL AND THE PONY RECOVERING FAST FOR THE CLEAR MOUNTAIN AIR SEEMED TO ACT LIKE A CURE FOR WOUNDS
lbi-8254-84205-0002 EVERY DAY THAT CAME SHOWED THE INJURED ANIMAL IN BETTER CONDITION
lbi-8254-84205-0003 ITS EFFORTS TO MOVE NO LONGER MADE CHRIS WINCE AND FORGET HIS OWN PAINS IN THOSE HE FELT AT SEEING THE MUSTANG SUFFER
lbi-8254-84205-0004 EVERY ONE WAS BUSY FOR THE KEEPING WATCH REGULARLY TOOK UP A GOOD DEAL OF TIME

lbi-8288-274150-0001 IN A WORD MALICORNE PHILOSOPHER THAT HE WAS THOUGH HE KNEW IT NOT HAD LEARNED HOW TO INSPIRE THE KING WITH AN APPETITE IN THE MIDST OF PLENTY AND WITH DESIRE IN THE ASSURANCE OF POSSESSION

lbi-8288-274150-0003 BUT THE DOOR REMAINED CLOSED AND NEITHER SAINT AIGNAN NOR THE PAINTER APPEARED NOR DID THE HANGINGS EVEN MOVE
