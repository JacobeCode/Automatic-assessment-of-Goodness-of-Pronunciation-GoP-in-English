lbi-3000-15664-0000 SHASTA RAMBLES AND MODOC MEMORIES
lbi-3000-15664-0001 ARCTIC BEAUTY AND DESOLATION WITH THEIR BLESSINGS AND DANGERS ALL MAY BE FOUND HERE TO TEST THE ENDURANCE AND SKILL OF ADVENTUROUS CLIMBERS BUT FAR BETTER THAN CLIMBING THE MOUNTAIN IS GOING AROUND ITS WARM FERTILE BASE ENJOYING ITS BOUNTIES LIKE A BEE CIRCLING AROUND A BANK OF FLOWERS
lbi-3000-15664-0002 PERHAPS THE PROFESSION OF DOING GOOD MAY BE FULL BUT EVERY BODY SHOULD BE KIND AT LEAST TO HIMSELF
lbi-3000-15664-0003 GO QUIETLY ALONE NO HARM WILL BEFALL YOU
lbi-3000-15664-0004 BUT IT IS FAR BETTER TO GO AFOOT
lbi-3000-15664-0005 ONE BLANKET WILL BE ENOUGH TO CARRY OR YOU MAY FOREGO THE PLEASURE AND BURDEN ALTOGETHER AS WOOD FOR FIRES IS EVERYWHERE ABUNDANT
lbi-3000-15664-0006 ONLY A LITTLE FOOD WILL BE REQUIRED
lbi-3000-15664-0007 THUS ONE SAUNTERS ON AND ON IN THE GLORIOUS RADIANCE IN UTTER PEACE AND FORGETFULNESS OF TIME
lbi-3000-15664-0008 YET STRANGE TO SAY THERE ARE DAYS EVEN HERE SOMEWHAT DULL LOOKING WHEN THE MOUNTAIN SEEMS UNCOMMUNICATIVE SENDING OUT NO APPRECIABLE INVITATION AS IF NOT AT HOME
lbi-3000-15664-0009 AT SUCH TIME ITS HEIGHT SEEMS MUCH LESS AS IF CROUCHING AND WEARY IT WERE TAKING REST
lbi-3000-15664-0010 EVERY CRYSTAL DANCES RESPONSIVE TO THE TOUCHES OF THE SUN AND CURRENTS OF SAP IN THE GROWING CELLS OF ALL THE VEGETATION ARE EVER IN A VITAL WHIRL AND RUSH AND THOUGH MANY FEET AND WINGS ARE FOLDED HOW MANY ARE ASTIR
lbi-3000-15664-0011 SLIGHT RAINSTORMS ARE LIKELY TO BE ENCOUNTERED IN A TRIP ROUND THE MOUNTAIN BUT ONE MAY EASILY FIND SHELTER BENEATH WELL THATCHED TREES THAT SHED THE RAIN LIKE A ROOF
lbi-3000-15664-0012 THEN THE SHINING OF THE WET LEAVES IS DELIGHTFUL AND THE STEAMY FRAGRANCE AND THE BURST OF BIRD SONG FROM A MULTITUDE OF THRUSHES AND FINCHES AND WARBLERS THAT HAVE NESTS IN THE CHAPARRAL
lbi-3000-15664-0013 A THOUSAND THOUSAND VOICES ARE HEARD BUT SO FINELY BLENDED THEY SEEM A PART OF THE NIGHT ITSELF AND MAKE A DEEPER SILENCE
lbi-3000-15664-0014 IN SETTING OUT FROM STRAWBERRY VALLEY BY BEARING OFF TO THE NORTHWESTWARD A FEW MILES YOU MAY SEE
lbi-3000-15664-0015 IN APPROACHING IT ITS SUSPICIOUS LOOKING YELLOW SPOTTED HOOD AND WATCHFUL ATTITUDE WILL BE LIKELY TO MAKE YOU GO CAUTIOUSLY THROUGH THE BOG WHERE IT STANDS AS IF YOU WERE APPROACHING A DANGEROUS SNAKE
lbi-3000-15664-0016 IT IS LINED WITH EMERALD ALGAE AND MOSSES AND SHADED WITH ALDER WILLOW AND THORN BUSHES WHICH GIVE IT A FINE SETTING
lbi-3000-15664-0017 IT IS THREE OR FOUR MILES LONG AND TERMINATES AT AN ELEVATION OF ABOUT NINE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FEET ABOVE SEA LEVEL IN MORAINE SPRINKLED ICE CLIFFS SIXTY FEET HIGH
lbi-3000-15664-0018 THE LONG GRAY SLOPES LEADING UP TO THE GLACIER SEEM REMARKABLY SMOOTH AND UNBROKEN
lbi-3000-15664-0019 MOST OF THE DRAINAGE OF THE GLACIER VANISHES AT ONCE IN THE POROUS ROCKS TO REAPPEAR IN SPRINGS IN THE DISTANT VALLEY AND IT IS ONLY IN TIME OF FLOOD THAT THE CHANNEL CARRIES MUCH WATER THEN THERE ARE SEVERAL FINE FALLS IN THE GORGE SIX HUNDRED FEET OR MORE IN HEIGHT
lbi-3000-15664-0020 TRACING THIS WILD CHANGING CHANNEL GORGE GULLY OR CANYON THE SECTIONS WILL SHOW MOUNT SHASTA AS A HUGE PALIMPSEST CONTAINING THE RECORDS LAYER UPON LAYER OF STRANGELY CONTRASTED EVENTS IN ITS FIERY ICY HISTORY
lbi-3000-15664-0021 REGAINING THE LOW GROUND AT THE BASE OF THE MOUNTAIN AND HOLDING ON IN YOUR GRAND ORBIT YOU PASS THROUGH A BELT OF JUNIPER WOODS CALLED THE CEDARS TO SHEEP ROCK AT THE FOOT OF THE SHASTA PASS
lbi-3000-15664-0022 HERE YOU STRIKE THE OLD EMIGRANT ROAD WHICH LEADS OVER THE LOW DIVIDE TO THE EASTERN SLOPES OF THE MOUNTAIN
lbi-3000-15664-0023 MOUNT BREMER IS THE MOST NOTED STRONGHOLD OF THE SHEEP IN THE WHOLE SHASTA REGION
lbi-3000-15664-0024 LARGE FLOCKS DWELL HERE FROM YEAR TO YEAR WINTER AND SUMMER DESCENDING OCCASIONALLY INTO THE ADJACENT SAGE PLAINS AND LAVA BEDS TO FEED BUT EVER READY TO TAKE REFUGE IN THE JAGGED CRAGS OF THEIR MOUNTAIN AT EVERY ALARM
lbi-3000-15664-0025 WHILE TRAVELING WITH A COMPANY OF HUNTERS I SAW ABOUT FIFTY IN ONE FLOCK
lbi-3000-15664-0026 THE MULE DEER ARE NEARLY AS HEAVY
lbi-3000-15664-0027 THEIR LONG MASSIVE EARS GIVE THEM A VERY STRIKING APPEARANCE
lbi-3000-15664-0028 BUT NEITHER THE GLORIFIED WOODS ON THE ONE HAND NOR THE LAKE ON THE OTHER COULD AT FIRST HOLD THE EYE
lbi-3000-15664-0029 THEN FELL THE GLOAMING MAKING EVERYTHING STILL MORE FORBIDDING AND MYSTERIOUS
lbi-3000-15664-0030 THEN DARKNESS LIKE DEATH
lbi-3000-15664-0031 TWO OR THREE MILES FARTHER ON IS THE MAIN STRONGHOLD OF THE MODOCS HELD BY THEM SO LONG AND DEFIANTLY AGAINST ALL THE SOLDIERS THAT COULD BE BROUGHT TO THE ATTACK
lbi-3000-15664-0032 THE DUCKS LESS WARY KEPT THEIR PLACES MERELY SWIMMING IN AND OUT THROUGH OPENINGS IN THE RUSHES RIPPLING THE GLASSY WATER AND RAISING SPANGLES IN THEIR WAKE
lbi-3000-15664-0033 THEY ARE BROAD RUGGED CREVASSED CLOUDLIKE MASSES OF DOWN GRINDING ICE POURING FORTH STREAMS OF MUDDY WATER AS MEASURES OF THE WORK THEY ARE DOING IN SCULPTURING THE ROCKS BENEATH THEM VERY UNLIKE THE LONG MAJESTIC GLACIERS OF ALASKA THAT RIVERLIKE GO WINDING DOWN THE VALLEYS THROUGH THE FORESTS TO THE SEA
lbi-3000-15664-0034 THUS THE SHASTA RIVER ISSUES FROM A LARGE LAKE LIKE SPRING IN SHASTA VALLEY AND ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THE VOLUME OF THE MC CLOUD GUSHES FORTH IN A GRAND SPRING ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN A FEW MILES BACK FROM ITS IMMEDIATE BASE
lbi-3000-15664-0035 SHOULD THE VOLUME OF THE STREAM WHERE YOU STRIKE IT SEEM SMALL THEN YOU WILL KNOW THAT YOU ARE ABOVE THE SPRING IF LARGE NEARLY EQUAL TO ITS VOLUME AT ITS CONFLUENCE WITH THE PITT RIVER THEN YOU ARE BELOW IT AND IN EITHER CASE HAVE ONLY TO FOLLOW THE RIVER UP OR DOWN UNTIL YOU COME TO IT
lbi-3000-15664-0036 UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS YOU MAY HEAR THE ROAR OF THE WATER RUSHING FROM THE ROCK AT A DISTANCE OF HALF A MILE OR EVEN MORE OR YOU MAY NOT HEAR IT UNTIL WITHIN A FEW RODS
lbi-3000-15664-0037 THE VIVID GREEN OF THE BOULDERS BENEATH THE WATER IS VERY STRIKING AND COLORS THE ENTIRE STREAM WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE PORTIONS BROKEN INTO FOAM
lbi-3000-15664-0038 ASPLENIUM EPILOBIUM HEUCHERA HAZEL DOGWOOD AND ALDER MAKE A LUXURIOUS FRINGE AND SETTING AND THE FORESTS OF DOUGLAS SPRUCE ALONG THE BANKS ARE THE FINEST I HAVE EVER SEEN IN THE SIERRA
lbi-3000-15664-0039 TRACING RIVERS TO THEIR FOUNTAINS MAKES THE MOST CHARMING OF TRAVELS
lbi-3000-15664-0040 AS THE LIFE BLOOD OF THE LANDSCAPES THE BEST OF THE WILDERNESS COMES TO THEIR BANKS AND NOT ONE DULL PASSAGE IS FOUND IN ALL THEIR EVENTFUL HISTORIES
lbi-3000-15664-0041 TRACING THE MC CLOUD TO ITS HIGHEST SPRINGS AND OVER THE DIVIDE TO THE FOUNTAINS OF FALL RIVER NEAR FORT CROOK THENCE DOWN THAT RIVER TO ITS CONFLUENCE WITH THE PITT ON FROM THERE TO THE VOLCANIC REGION ABOUT LASSEN'S BUTTE THROUGH THE BIG MEADOWS AMONG THE SOURCES OF THE FEATHER RIVER AND DOWN THROUGH FORESTS OF SUGAR PINE TO THE FERTILE PLAINS OF CHICO THIS IS A GLORIOUS SAUNTER AND IMPOSES NO HARDSHIP
lbi-3000-15664-0042 THE ASCENT OF LASSEN'S BUTTE IS AN EASY WALK AND THE VIEWS FROM THE SUMMIT ARE EXTREMELY TELLING
lbi-3000-15664-0043 THE LOFTY ICY SHASTA TOWERING HIGH ABOVE ALL SEEMS BUT AN HOUR'S WALK FROM YOU THOUGH THE DISTANCE IN AN AIR LINE IS ABOUT SIXTY MILES
lbi-3000-15664-0044 THE BIG MEADOWS LIE NEAR THE FOOT OF LASSEN'S BUTTE A BEAUTIFUL SPACIOUS BASIN SET IN THE HEART OF THE RICHLY FORESTED MOUNTAINS SCARCELY SURPASSED IN THE GRANDEUR OF ITS SURROUNDINGS BY TAHOE
lbi-3000-15664-0045 THE GREAT WILDS OF OUR COUNTRY ONCE HELD TO BE BOUNDLESS AND INEXHAUSTIBLE ARE BEING RAPIDLY INVADED AND OVERRUN IN EVERY DIRECTION AND EVERYTHING DESTRUCTIBLE IN THEM IS BEING DESTROYED
lbi-3000-15664-0046 EVERY LANDSCAPE LOW AND HIGH SEEMS DOOMED TO BE TRAMPLED AND HARRIED
lbi-3081-166546-0000 WHEN WE TOOK OUR SEATS AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE IT WAS WITH THE FEELING OF BEING NO LONGER LOOKED UPON AS CONNECTED IN ANY WAY WITH THIS CASE
lbi-3081-166546-0001 INSTANTLY THEY ABSORBED ALL MY ATTENTION THOUGH I DARED NOT GIVE THEM A DIRECT LOOK AND CONTINUED TO OBSERVE THEM ONLY IN THE GLASS
lbi-3081-166546-0002 YES AND A VERY RESPECTABLE ONE
lbi-3081-166546-0003 THE LADY IS NOT THE MOTHER OF THE BOYS BUT THEIR AUNT
lbi-3081-166546-0004 THE BOYS BELONG TO THE GENTLEMAN WHO IS A WIDOWER
lbi-3081-166546-0005 GEORGE NODDED
lbi-3081-166546-0006 THE BOYS LOOK WIDE AWAKE ENOUGH IF THE FATHER DOES NOT
lbi-3081-166546-0007 DO THEY STILL INSIST THAT MISS CHALLONER WAS THE ONLY PERSON IN THE ROOM WITH THEM AT THIS TIME
lbi-3081-166546-0008 GEORGE
lbi-3081-166546-0009 HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A SUICIDE
lbi-3081-166546-0010 I KNOW IT SOUNDS FOOLISH BUT THE ALTERNATIVE IS SO IMPROBABLE
lbi-3081-166546-0011 THE BOYS LOOK WIDE AWAKE ENOUGH BUT WHO CAN TELL I WOULD SOONER BELIEVE THAT
lbi-3081-166546-0012 A MAN WAS LOOKING IN FROM THE CORRIDOR BEHIND AT THE FOUR PERSONS WE WERE JUST DISCUSSING
lbi-3081-166546-0013 I INQUIRED OF GEORGE WITH MY EYES STILL ON THIS FURTIVE WATCHER
lbi-3081-166546-0014 I TOOK QUITE A FANCY TO HIM WHY
lbi-3081-166546-0015 I AM LOOKING AT HIM NOW
lbi-3081-166546-0016 JUST AN EVERYDAY DETECTIVE BUT AMBITIOUS I SUPPOSE AND QUITE ALIVE TO THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING THOROUGH
lbi-3081-166546-0017 YES HE'S MERCURIAL IN ALL HIS MOVEMENTS
lbi-3081-166546-0018 WHAT DOES HE WANT
lbi-3081-166546-0019 I ASKED AS SOON AS GEORGE HAD RETURNED TO MY SIDE
lbi-3081-166546-0020 HE WANTS ME TO STAND READY TO OBEY ANY SUMMONS THE POLICE MAY SEND ME
lbi-3081-166546-0021 I EMPHASISED COMPLACENTLY
lbi-3081-166546-0022 HE APPEARED TO KNOW FOR HE TOLD ME AT ONCE THAT HE WAS DETECTIVE GRYCE A MAN WHO HAD GROWN OLD IN SOLVING JUST SUCH BAFFLING PROBLEMS AS THESE
lbi-3081-166546-0023 HE GAVE UP WORK SOME TIME AGO I HAVE BEEN TOLD MY HUSBAND WENT ON BUT EVIDENTLY A GREAT CASE STILL HAS ITS ALLUREMENT FOR HIM
lbi-3081-166546-0024 THE TRAIL HERE MUST BE A VERY BLIND ONE FOR THEM TO CALL HIM IN
lbi-3081-166546-0025 I WISH WE HAD NOT LEFT SO SOON
lbi-3081-166546-0026 HE WAS LATE OF COURSE BUT WHEN HE DID APPEAR I ALMOST FORGOT OUR USUAL GREETING IN MY HURRY TO ASK HIM IF HE HAD SEEN THE EVENING PAPERS
lbi-3081-166546-0027 HOWEVER A LITTLE LATER WE HAD A COMFORTABLE CHAT
lbi-3081-166546-0028 IT WAS ONE WHICH GAVE ME A SMALL TRIUMPH OVER GEORGE
lbi-3081-166546-0029 THE SUGGESTION HE HAD LAUGHED AT WAS NOT SO ENTIRELY FOOLISH AS HE HAD BEEN PLEASED TO CONSIDER IT
lbi-3081-166546-0030 THEIR GREETING WAS CORDIAL AND THE LINES ON THE LATTER'S FACE RELAXED A LITTLE AS HE MET THE STILL BRIGHT EYE OF THE MAN UPON WHOSE INSTINCT AND JUDGMENT SO MUCH RELIANCE HAD ALWAYS BEEN PLACED
lbi-3081-166546-0031 THIS IS VERY GOOD OF YOU HE BEGAN GLANCING DOWN AT THE AGED DETECTIVE'S BUNDLED UP LEGS AND GENTLY PUSHING A CHAIR TOWARDS HIM
lbi-3081-166546-0032 IT'S THE MOST INEXPLICABLE THERE
lbi-3081-166546-0033 BUT CLEWS THERE ARE ABSOLUTELY NONE
lbi-3081-166546-0034 THAT IS WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND ANY PERHAPS YOU CAN
lbi-3081-166546-0035 AT LEAST THAT IS WHAT WE HOPE
lbi-3081-166546-0036 IT'S A CASE IN A THOUSAND GRYCE
lbi-3081-166546-0037 THE OLD MAN'S EYES SHOT FIRE AND UNCONSCIOUSLY ONE FOOT SLIPPED TO THE FLOOR
lbi-3081-166546-0038 SHE HAD NO COMPANION NEAR HER
lbi-3081-166546-0039 NO WORD NO CRY JUST A COLLAPSE AND SUDDEN FALL
lbi-3081-166546-0040 IN OLDEN DAYS THEY WOULD HAVE SAID STRUCK BY A BOLT FROM HEAVEN
lbi-3081-166546-0041 WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT GRYCE
lbi-3081-166546-0042 I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE THE DESK YOU SPEAK OF AND THE SPOT WHERE SHE FELL
lbi-3081-166546-0043 A YOUNG FELLOW WHO HAD BEEN HOVERING IN THE BACKGROUND AT ONCE STEPPED FORWARD
lbi-3081-166546-0044 HE WAS THE PLAIN FACED DETECTIVE WHO HAD SPOKEN TO GEORGE
lbi-3081-166546-0045 THIS SWEETWATER AS THEY CALLED HIM WAS I HAVE SINCE UNDERSTOOD ONE OF HIS PROTEGES AND MORE OR LESS OF A FAVOURITE
lbi-3081-166546-0046 BEEN OVER THE GROUND STUDIED THE AFFAIR CAREFULLY
lbi-3081-166546-0047 VERY WELL THEN YOU'RE IN A POSITION TO PIONEER ME
lbi-3081-166546-0048 WELL WELL THAT'S HONEST AT ALL EVENTS
lbi-3081-166546-0049 BUT I'M IN NO POSITION TO MAKE PROMISES
lbi-3081-166546-0050 OLD DAYS DON'T RETURN FOR THE ASKING
lbi-3081-166546-0051 WHETHER HE GOT ANYTHING ELSE IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY FROM HIS MANNER AS HE FINALLY SANK INTO A CHAIR BY ONE OF THE OPENINGS AND LOOKED DOWN ON THE LOBBY BELOW
lbi-3081-166546-0052 ONE OR TWO OF THE MUSICIANS FROM THE END OF THE HALL
lbi-3081-166546-0053 NATURALLY THEY REACHED HER FIRST
lbi-3081-166546-0054 MARK SOWERBY AND CLAUS HENNERBERG
lbi-3081-166546-0055 HONEST GERMANS MEN WHO HAVE PLAYED HERE FOR YEARS
lbi-3081-166546-0056 WHO CAME NEXT ON THE SCENE SOME PEOPLE FROM THE LOBBY
lbi-3081-166546-0057 ANYBODY BEFORE THE FATHER CAME IN
lbi-3081-166546-0058 YES MISS CLARKE THE MIDDLE AGED LADY WITH THE PARRISHES
lbi-3081-166546-0059 I SUPPOSE SHE HAS BEEN CAREFULLY QUESTIONED VERY I SHOULD SAY
lbi-3081-166546-0060 AND SHE SPEAKS OF NO WEAPON
lbi-3081-166546-0061 NOT TILL THE DOCTOR CAME HER DOCTOR WHO WAS HAPPILY IN HIS OFFICE IN THIS VERY BUILDING
lbi-3081-166546-0062 YES MISTER SLATER THE ASSISTANT MANAGER WHO WAS IN THE LOBBY AT THE TIME SAYS THAT TEN MINUTES AT LEAST MUST HAVE ELAPSED
lbi-3081-166546-0063 NO DOUBT
lbi-3081-166546-0064 SWEETWATER SOMEONE DREW THAT WEAPON OUT
lbi-3081-166546-0065 NOT ALTOGETHER BY ME
lbi-3081-166546-0066 WHEREVER SHE PLEASES ONLY I CAN'T WALK FAR
lbi-3081-166546-0067 IT HAS NOT BEEN RUNNING SINCE LAST NIGHT OR IT WOULD BE FULL OF CURIOUS PEOPLE ALL THE TIME HUSTLING TO GET A GLIMPSE OF THIS PLACE
lbi-3081-166546-0068 BUT THEY'LL PUT A MAN ON FOR YOU
lbi-3081-166546-0069 VERY GOOD MANAGE IT AS YOU WILL
lbi-3081-166546-0070 I'LL WAIT HERE TILL YOU'RE READY EXPLAIN YOURSELF TO THE LADY TELL HER I'M AN OLD AND RHEUMATIC INVALID WHO HAS BEEN USED TO ASKING HIS OWN QUESTIONS
lbi-3081-166546-0071 AS HER QUIET FIGURE APPEARED IN THE DOORWAY SWEETWATER STOLE A GLANCE AT MISTER GRYCE
lbi-3081-166546-0072 THERE WAS NO DOUBTING THEM IN THIS INSTANCE
lbi-3081-166546-0073 YES
lbi-3081-166546-0074 FOR SOME LITTLE TIME THAT IS IT SEEMED LONG THOUGH I BELIEVE IT WAS NOT MORE THAN A MINUTE BEFORE TWO MEN CAME RUNNING FROM THE MUSICIANS GALLERY
lbi-3081-166546-0075 YES MANY TIMES
lbi-3081-166546-0076 WHAT MADE THE DIFFERENCE
lbi-3081-166546-0077 MISS CLARKE STARTED AND HER SWEET FACE SHOWED A MOMENT'S PERPLEXITY DID I SHE QUERIED MUSINGLY
lbi-3081-166546-0078 NO A VERY NATURAL ONE I SHOULD SAY
lbi-3081-166546-0079 AND THE GLANCE SHE CAST HIM WHILE NOT MEETING HIS EYE SHOWED THAT SHE UNDERSTOOD THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ADMISSION
lbi-3081-166546-0080 I KNOW SHE SAID WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO ASK ME NOW
lbi-3081-166546-0081 THERE WAS NO PONIARD IN THE WOUND
lbi-3081-166546-0082 THE TIME IS NARROWED DOWN TO ONE AND IN THAT ONE MISS CLARKE WAS THE ONLY PERSON TO TOUCH HER
lbi-3081-166546-0083 I WILL TROUBLE YOU NO FURTHER
lbi-3081-166546-0084 SWEETWATER HELP ME OUT OF THIS
lbi-3081-166546-0085 BUT VIGOUR RETURNED TO HIM BEFORE HE HAD WELL REACHED THE DOOR AND HE SHOWED SOME OF HIS OLD SPIRIT AS HE THANKED MISS CLARKE AND TURNED TO TAKE THE ELEVATOR
lbi-3081-166546-0086 THE NEXT MINUTE SHE WAS IN THIS LADY'S ARMS
lbi-3081-166546-0087 NO WEAPON PROTRUDED FROM THE WOUND NOR WAS ANY FOUND ON OR NEAR HER IN THE MEZZANINE WHAT FOLLOWS
lbi-3081-166546-0088 SHE STRUCK THE BLOW HERSELF AND THE STRENGTH OF PURPOSE WHICH LED HER TO DO THIS GAVE HER THE ADDITIONAL FORCE TO PULL THE WEAPON OUT AND FLING IT FROM HER
lbi-3081-166546-0089 IT DID NOT FALL UPON THE FLOOR AROUND HER THEREFORE IT FLEW THROUGH ONE OF THOSE OPENINGS INTO THE LOBBY AND THERE IT EITHER WILL BE OR HAS BEEN FOUND
lbi-3170-137482-0000 WITH AN EDUCATION WHICH OUGHT TO HAVE ENSURED ME AN HONOURABLE STANDING IN THE WORLD WITH SOME INTELLIGENCE WIT GOOD LITERARY AND SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE AND ENDOWED WITH THOSE ACCIDENTAL PHYSICAL QUALITIES WHICH ARE SUCH A GOOD PASSPORT INTO SOCIETY I FOUND MYSELF AT THE AGE OF TWENTY THE MEAN FOLLOWER OF A SUBLIME ART IN WHICH IF GREAT TALENT IS RIGHTLY ADMIRED MEDIOCRITY IS AS RIGHTLY DESPISED
lbi-3170-137482-0001 I WAS COMPELLED BY POVERTY TO BECOME A MEMBER OF A MUSICAL BAND IN WHICH I COULD EXPECT NEITHER ESTEEM NOR CONSIDERATION AND I WAS WELL AWARE THAT I SHOULD BE THE LAUGHING STOCK OF THE PERSONS WHO HAD KNOWN ME AS A DOCTOR IN DIVINITY AS AN ECCLESIASTIC AND AS AN OFFICER IN THE ARMY AND HAD WELCOMED ME IN THE HIGHEST SOCIETY
lbi-3170-137482-0002 I FELT THAT IN MY FIRST PROFESSION AS I WAS NOT BLESSED WITH THE VOCATION NECESSARY TO IT I SHOULD HAVE SUCCEEDED ONLY BY DINT OF HYPOCRISY AND I SHOULD HAVE BEEN DESPICABLE IN MY OWN ESTIMATION EVEN IF I HAD SEEN THE PURPLE MANTLE ON MY SHOULDERS FOR THE GREATEST DIGNITIES CANNOT SILENCE A MAN'S OWN CONSCIENCE
lbi-3170-137482-0003 BESIDES I WAS OF OPINION THAT A MAN'S PROFESSION WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE OUGHT TO SUPPLY HIM WITH ENOUGH MONEY TO SATISFY ALL HIS WANTS AND THE VERY POOR PAY OF AN OFFICER WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENT TO COVER MY EXPENSES BECAUSE MY EDUCATION HAD GIVEN ME GREATER WANTS THAN THOSE OF OFFICERS IN GENERAL
lbi-3170-137482-0004 OUR SCANDALOUS PROCEEDINGS OFTEN EXPOSED US TO THE GREATEST DANGER
lbi-3170-137482-0005 WE WOULD VERY OFTEN SPEND THE WHOLE NIGHT RAMBLING ABOUT THE CITY INVENTING AND CARRYING INTO EXECUTION THE MOST IMPERTINENT PRACTICAL JOKES
lbi-3170-137482-0006 WE DID THE SAME WITH PHYSICIANS WHOM WE OFTEN SENT HALF DRESSED TO SOME NOBLEMAN WHO WAS ENJOYING EXCELLENT HEALTH
lbi-3170-137482-0007 WHENEVER WE COULD CONTRIVE TO GET INTO A CHURCH TOWER WE THOUGHT IT GREAT FUN TO FRIGHTEN ALL THE PARISH BY RINGING THE ALARM BELL AS IF SOME FIRE HAD BROKEN OUT BUT THAT WAS NOT ALL WE ALWAYS CUT THE BELL ROPES SO THAT IN THE MORNING THE CHURCHWARDENS HAD NO MEANS OF SUMMONING THE FAITHFUL TO EARLY MASS
lbi-3170-137482-0008 THIS IS THE AMUSING ADVENTURE WHICH CLOSED OUR EXPLOITS
lbi-3170-137482-0009 IN EVERY ONE OF THE SEVENTY TWO PARISHES OF THE CITY OF VENICE THERE IS A LARGE PUBLIC HOUSE CALLED MAGAZZINO
lbi-3170-137482-0010 YET THERE ARE A FEW PRIVATE ROOMS WHICH CONTAIN A TABLE SURROUNDED WITH BENCHES IN WHICH A RESPECTABLE FAMILY OR A FEW FRIENDS CAN ENJOY THEMSELVES IN A DECENT WAY
lbi-3170-137482-0011 THE WAITER OF THE MAGAZZINO CAME TO BE PAID AND OUR CHIEF GAVE HIM WHAT WAS DUE ENJOINING SILENCE UNDER PENALTY OF DEATH
lbi-3170-137482-0012 WE TOOK OUR THREE PRISONERS TO A LARGE BOAT
lbi-3170-137482-0013 WHERE IS MY HUSBAND
lbi-3170-137482-0014 NEVER FEAR YOU SHALL SEE HIM AGAIN TO MORROW
lbi-3170-137482-0015 MY READERS MAY IMAGINE WHETHER WE FELT INCLINED TO LAUGH WHEN THE CHARMING CREATURE BADE US GOOD NIGHT THANKING US ALL WITH PERFECT GOOD FAITH
lbi-3170-137482-0016 TWO DAYS AFTERWARDS OUR NOCTURNAL ORGY BEGAN TO BE TALKED OF
lbi-3170-137482-0017 IT WENT ON TO SAY THAT THE TWO MEN WHO HAD CARRIED HER OFF HAD TAKEN HER TO SUCH A PLACE WHERE THEY HAD AN HOUR LATER BEEN MET BY THE OTHER SIX AND THAT THEY HAD ALL REPAIRED TO THE TWO SWORDS WHERE THEY HAD SPENT AN HOUR IN DRINKING
lbi-3170-137482-0018 THERE WAS NO COWARDLY TRAITOR AMONGST US ALTHOUGH WE WERE ALL POOR BUT FEAR HAD ITS EFFECT AND OUR NOCTURNAL PRANKS WERE NOT RENEWED
lbi-3170-137482-0019 I PICKED IT UP AND COMING UP TO HIM JUST AS HE WAS GOING DOWN THE STEPS I HANDED IT TO HIM
lbi-3170-137482-0020 I TOLD HIM AND HE INSISTED UPON MY COMING WITH HIM IN THE GONDOLA SAYING THAT HE WOULD LEAVE ME AT MY HOUSE
lbi-3170-137482-0021 I RUBBED IT WITH ALL MY STRENGTH BUT HE TOLD ME IN A SORT OF INDISTINCT WHISPER THAT THE NUMBNESS WAS SPREADING ALL ALONG THE LEFT SIDE AND THAT HE WAS DYING
lbi-3170-137482-0022 I JUMPED OUT OF THE GONDOLA AND FOUND MYSELF ON THE VERY SPOT WHERE THREE YEARS BEFORE I HAD TAUGHT RAZETTA SUCH A FORCIBLE LESSON I ENQUIRED FOR A SURGEON AT THE FIRST COFFEE HOUSE AND RAN TO THE HOUSE THAT WAS POINTED OUT TO ME
lbi-3170-137482-0023 TAKING EVERYTHING UPON MYSELF I ORDERED A SERVANT TO HURRY OUT FOR A PHYSICIAN WHO CAME IN A SHORT TIME AND ORDERED THE PATIENT TO BE BLED AGAIN THUS APPROVING THE FIRST BLEEDING PRESCRIBED BY ME
lbi-3170-137482-0024 THINKING I HAD A RIGHT TO WATCH THE SICK MAN I SETTLED MYSELF NEAR HIS BED TO GIVE HIM EVERY CARE HE REQUIRED
lbi-3170-137482-0025 THEY DID NOT KNOW WHO I WAS AND DID NOT LIKE TO ASK ME WHILST I THOUGHT IT BETTER TO PRESERVE A MODEST SILENCE
lbi-3170-137482-0026 HE HAD GAMBLED AND LOST A GREAT DEAL AND HIS BROTHER WAS HIS MOST BITTER ENEMY BECAUSE HE WAS INFATUATED WITH THE IDEA THAT HE HAD TRIED TO POISON HIM
lbi-3170-137482-0027 THE PHYSICIAN WHO ATTENDED HIM WAS NAMED TERRO HE THOUGHT BY SOME PECULIAR TRAIN OF REASONING THAT HE COULD CURE HIM BY APPLYING A MERCURIAL OINTMENT TO THE CHEST TO WHICH NO ONE RAISED ANY OBJECTION
lbi-3170-137482-0028 DELIGHTED WITH SUCH A FORTUNATE RESULT WE LAY DOWN AGAIN
lbi-3170-137482-0029 HE ENTREATED ME TO TELL HIM THE TRUTH
lbi-3170-137482-0030 WHAT EXTRAORDINARY THINGS WILL SOMETIMES OCCUR FROM MERE CHANCE OR FROM THE FORCE OF CIRCUMSTANCES
lbi-3170-137482-0031 UNWILLING TO HURT HIS VANITY BY TELLING HIM THAT HE WAS MISTAKEN I TOOK THE WILD RESOLUTION OF INFORMING HIM IN THE PRESENCE OF HIS TWO FRIENDS THAT I POSSESSED A CERTAIN NUMERAL CALCULUS WHICH GAVE ANSWERS ALSO IN NUMBERS TO ANY QUESTIONS I LIKED TO PUT
lbi-3170-137482-0032 I OBEYED IMPLICITLY AND MET YOUR EXCELLENCY
lbi-3170-137482-0033 THE THREE FRIENDS WERE ASTOUNDED
lbi-3170-137482-0034 I DECLARED MYSELF QUITE WILLING FOR IT WAS NECESSARY TO BRAZEN IT OUT AFTER HAVING VENTURED AS FAR AS I HAD DONE
lbi-3170-137482-0035 HE WROTE THE QUESTION AND GAVE IT TO ME I READ IT I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND EITHER THE SUBJECT OR THE MEANING OF THE WORDS BUT IT DID NOT MATTER I HAD TO GIVE AN ANSWER
lbi-3170-137482-0036 IF THE QUESTION WAS SO OBSCURE THAT I COULD NOT MAKE OUT THE SENSE OF IT IT WAS NATURAL THAT I SHOULD NOT UNDERSTAND THE ANSWER
lbi-3170-137482-0037 THEY ALL ASKED ME HOW LONG I WOULD REQUIRE TO TEACH THEM THE RULES OF MY SUBLIME CALCULUS
lbi-3170-137482-0038 NOT VERY LONG I ANSWERED AND I WILL TEACH YOU AS YOU WISH ALTHOUGH THE HERMIT ASSURED ME THAT I WOULD DIE SUDDENLY WITHIN THREE DAYS IF I COMMUNICATED MY SCIENCE TO ANYONE BUT I HAVE NO FAITH WHATEVER IN THAT PREDICTION
lbi-3170-137482-0039 THEY BELIEVED THAT THROUGH ME THEY POSSESSED THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE THE UNIVERSAL PANACEA THE INTERCOURSE WITH ALL THE ELEMENTARY HEAVENLY AND INFERNAL SPIRITS THEY HAD NO DOUBT WHATEVER THAT THANKS TO MY SUBLIME SCIENCE THEY COULD FIND OUT THE SECRETS OF EVERY GOVERNMENT IN EUROPE
lbi-3170-137482-0040 BUT ALTHOUGH BELIEVING FULLY IN MY ORACLES THEY WERE TOO KIND HEARTED TO THINK THEM THE WORK OF THE DEVIL AND IT SUITED THEIR NATURAL GOODNESS BETTER TO BELIEVE MY ANSWERS INSPIRED BY SOME HEAVENLY SPIRIT
lbi-3170-137482-0041 THEY WERE NOT ONLY GOOD CHRISTIANS AND FAITHFUL TO THE CHURCH BUT EVEN REAL DEVOTEES AND FULL OF SCRUPLES
lbi-3170-137482-0042 AS FOR THE EUCHARIST TRANSUBSTANTIATION THE REAL PRESENCE IT WAS ALL NO MYSTERY TO THEM BUT PALPABLE EVIDENCE AND YET THEY WERE NOT JESUITS
lbi-3170-137482-0043 I MIGHT BE TOLD THAT IF I HAD WISHED TO FOLLOW THE RULES OF PURE MORALITY I OUGHT EITHER TO HAVE DECLINED INTIMATE INTERCOURSE WITH THEM OR TO HAVE UNDECEIVED THEM
lbi-3170-137482-0044 BESIDES I FOUND IT VERY FLATTERING TO MY VANITY TO BECOME THE SUBJECT OF THE SPECULATIVE CHATTERING OF EMPTY FOOLS WHO HAVING NOTHING ELSE TO DO ARE ALWAYS TRYING TO FIND OUT THE CAUSE OF EVERY MORAL PHENOMENON THEY MEET WITH WHICH THEIR NARROW INTELLECT CANNOT UNDERSTAND
lbi-3170-137482-0045 WHOEVER YOU MAY BE I AM INDEBTED TO YOU FOR MY LIFE
lbi-3170-137482-0046 YOUR APARTMENT IS READY YOU MAY SEND YOUR CLOTHES YOU SHALL HAVE A SERVANT A GONDOLA AT YOUR ORDERS MY OWN TABLE AND TEN SEQUINS A MONTH
lbi-3170-137482-0047 YOU NEED NOT THINK OF THE FUTURE THINK ONLY OF ENJOYING YOURSELF AND TAKE ME AS YOUR ADVISER IN EVERYTHING THAT MAY HAPPEN TO YOU IN EVERYTHING YOU MAY WISH TO UNDERTAKE AND YOU MAY BE CERTAIN OF ALWAYS FINDING ME YOUR FRIEND
lbi-3170-137482-0048 I THREW MYSELF AT HIS FEET TO ASSURE HIM OF MY GRATITUDE AND EMBRACED HIM CALLING HIM MY FATHER
lbi-3536-23268-0000 SIR EDWARD NOT WHOLLY DISCOURAGED BY THE DENIAL WITH WHICH DORRIFORTH HAD WITH DELICACY ACQUAINTED HIM STILL HOPED FOR A KIND RECEPTION AND WAS SO OFTEN AT THE HOUSE OF MISSUS HORTON THAT LORD FREDERICK'S JEALOUSY WAS EXCITED AND THE TORTURES HE SUFFERED IN CONSEQUENCE CONVINCED HIM BEYOND A DOUBT OF THE SINCERITY OF HIS AFFECTION
lbi-3536-23268-0001 EVERY TIME HE BEHELD THE OBJECT OF HIS PASSION FOR HE STILL CONTINUED HIS VISITS THOUGH NOT SO FREQUENTLY AS HERETOFORE HE PLEADED HIS CAUSE WITH SUCH ARDOUR THAT MISS WOODLEY WHO WAS SOMETIMES PRESENT AND EVER COMPASSIONATE COULD NOT RESIST WISHING HIM SUCCESS
lbi-3536-23268-0002 YET DID THE WATCHFUL MISS WOODLEY OFTENTIMES HEAR A SIGH ESCAPE FROM HER UNKNOWN TO HERSELF TILL SHE WAS REMINDED OF IT AND THEN A SUDDEN BLUSH WOULD INSTANTLY OVERSPREAD HER FACE
lbi-3536-23268-0003 NIGHT AFTER NIGHT HIS SLEEP HAD BEEN DISTURBED BY FEARS FOR HER WHEN ABROAD MORNING AFTER MORNING IT HAD BEEN BROKEN BY THE CLAMOUR OF HER RETURN
lbi-3536-23268-0004 I HOPE MISS MILNER YOU PASS THIS EVENING AT HOME
lbi-3536-23268-0005 I THOUGHT MISS MILNER YOU GAVE ME YOUR WORD THAT YOU WOULD PASS THIS EVENING AT HOME
lbi-3536-23268-0006 YES INDEED AND I BELIEVE IT IS RIGHT THAT I SHOULD KEEP MY FIRST PROMISE IS IT NOT
lbi-3536-23268-0007 MISSUS HORTON ROSE FROM HER SEAT MOVED THE DECANTERS AND FRUIT ROUND THE TABLE STIRRED THE FIRE AND CAME BACK TO HER SEAT AGAIN BEFORE ANOTHER WORD WAS UTTERED
lbi-3536-23268-0008 NOR HAD THIS GOOD WOMAN'S OFFICIOUS LABOURS TAKEN THE LEAST FROM THE AWKWARDNESS OF THE SILENCE WHICH AS SOON AS THE BUSTLE SHE HAD MADE WAS OVER RETURNED IN ITS FULL FORCE
lbi-3536-23268-0009 MISS MILNER YOU SHALL NOT LEAVE THE HOUSE THIS EVENING SIR
lbi-3536-23268-0010 AND HE WALKED IMMEDIATELY OUT OF THE APARTMENT BY ANOTHER DOOR
lbi-3536-23268-0011 HER HAND FELL MOTIONLESS FROM THAT WHICH SHE HELD SHE APPEARED MOTIONLESS HERSELF TILL MISSUS HORTON BESEECHING HER NOT TO BE UNEASY AT THE TREATMENT SHE HAD RECEIVED MADE HER TEARS FLOW AS IF HER HEART WAS BREAKING
lbi-3536-23268-0012 IT WAS NOT FROM ANY REAL CAUSE OF GRIEF THAT SHE WEPT BUT THERE WAS A MAGNETIC QUALITY IN TEARS WHICH ALWAYS ATTRACTED HER'S
lbi-3536-23268-0013 DO YOU THINK I WOULD GO ANSWERED MISS MILNER WITH AN EAGERNESS THAT FOR A TIME SUPPRESSED HER TEARS IN CONTRADICTION TO HIS WILL
lbi-3536-23268-0014 IF YOU THINK SO MADAM I SEE NOTHING THAT SHOULD PREVENT ME NOW
lbi-3536-23268-0015 NIECE I COMMAND YOU NOT TO STIR OUT OF THIS ROOM THIS EVENING
lbi-3536-23268-0016 MISS WOODLEY OBEDIENTLY SAT DOWN AND THOUGH HER THOUGHTS AND HEART WERE IN THE CHAMBER OF HER FRIEND SHE NEVER MARKED BY ONE IMPERTINENT WORD OR BY ONE LINE OF HER FACE THE RESTRAINT SHE SUFFERED
lbi-3536-23268-0017 AT THE USUAL HOUR MISTER DORRIFORTH AND HIS WARD WERE SUMMONED TO TEA HE ENTERED WITH A COUNTENANCE WHICH EVINCED THE REMAINS OF ANGER HIS EYE GAVE TESTIMONY OF HIS ABSENT THOUGHTS AND THOUGH HE TOOK UP A PAMPHLET AFFECTING TO READ IT WAS PLAIN TO DISCERN THAT HE SCARCELY KNEW HE HELD IT IN HIS HAND
lbi-3536-23268-0018 MISS WOODLEY THOUGHT IT HER DUTY TO BE MUTE AND NOW THE GINGLE OF A TEA SPOON WAS LIKE A DEEP TONED BELL ALL WAS SO QUIET
lbi-3536-23268-0019 MISSUS HORTON TOO IN THE SELF APPROVING REFLECTION THAT SHE WAS NOT IN A QUARREL OR ALTERCATION OF ANY KIND FELT HERSELF AT THIS MOMENT REMARKABLY PEACEFUL AND CHARITABLE
lbi-3536-23268-0020 MISS WOODLEY DID NOT RECOLLECT HERSELF SO BUT WAS SO IN REALITY IN HER PEACE AND CHARITY WERE INSTINCTIVE VIRTUES ACCIDENT COULD NOT INCREASE THEM
lbi-3536-23268-0021 HE COUGHED DRANK HIS TEA ENDEAVOURED TO TALK BUT FOUND IT DIFFICULT SOMETIMES READ AND IN THIS MANNER NEAR TWO HOURS WERE PASSED AWAY WHEN MISS MILNER CAME INTO THE ROOM NOT DRESSED FOR A BALL BUT AS SHE HAD RISEN FROM DINNER
lbi-3536-23268-0022 DORRIFORTH READ ON AND SEEMED AFRAID OF LOOKING UP LEST HE SHOULD SEE WHAT HE COULD NOT HAVE PARDONED
lbi-3536-23268-0023 AFTER A FEW MINUTES PAUSE AND SOME LITTLE EMBARRASSMENT ON THE PART OF MISSUS HORTON AT THE DISAPPOINTMENT SHE HAD TO ENCOUNTER FROM THIS UNEXPECTED DUTIFUL CONDUCT SHE ASKED MISS MILNER IF SHE WOULD NOW HAVE ANY TEA
lbi-3536-23268-0024 DORRIFORTH THEN LAID THE BOOK OUT OF HIS HAND AND BY THE TIME THE SERVANT HAD LEFT THE ROOM THUS BEGAN
lbi-3536-23268-0025 IT IS OFTEN THE UNGRATEFUL TASK OF A FRIEND TO BE TROUBLESOME SOMETIMES UNMANNERLY
lbi-3536-23268-0026 FORGIVE THE DUTIES OF MY OFFICE AND BELIEVE THAT NO ONE IS HALF SO MUCH CONCERNED IF IT ROBS YOU OF ANY DEGREE OF HAPPINESS AS I MYSELF AM
lbi-3536-23268-0027 WHAT HE SAID HE LOOKED WITH SO MUCH SINCERITY THAT HAD SHE BEEN BURNING WITH RAGE AT HIS LATE BEHAVIOUR SHE MUST HAVE FORGIVEN HIM FOR THE REGRET WHICH HE SO FORCIBLY EXPREST
lbi-3536-23268-0028 SHE WAS GOING TO REPLY BUT FOUND SHE COULD NOT WITHOUT ACCOMPANYING HER WORDS WITH TEARS THEREFORE AFTER THE FIRST ATTEMPT SHE DESISTED
lbi-3536-23268-0029 ON THIS HE ROSE FROM HIS CHAIR AND GOING TO HER SAID ONCE MORE SHEW YOUR SUBMISSION BY OBEYING ME A SECOND TIME TO DAY
lbi-3536-23268-0030 KEEP YOUR APPOINTMENT AND BE ASSURED THAT I SHALL ISSUE MY COMMANDS WITH MORE CIRCUMSPECTION FOR THE FUTURE AS I FIND HOW STRICTLY THEY ARE COMPLIED WITH
lbi-3536-8226-0000 IN THE LAST COMMUNICATION WHICH HE HAD RECEIVED FROM LADY MILBOROUGH SHE HAD SCOLDED HIM IN TERMS THAT WERE FOR HER SEVERE BECAUSE HE HAD NOT RETURNED TO HIS WIFE AND TAKEN HER OFF WITH HIM TO NAPLES
lbi-3536-8226-0001 AND NOW IT HAD COME TO PASS THAT HIS SOLE REMAINING ALLY MISTER SAMUEL BOZZLE THE EX POLICEMAN WAS BECOMING WEARY OF HIS SERVICE
lbi-3536-8226-0002 AT LAST HE SENT WORD TO SAY THAT HE HIMSELF WOULD BE IN ENGLAND BEFORE THE END OF MARCH AND WOULD SEE THAT THE MAJESTY OF THE LAW SHOULD BE VINDICATED IN HIS FAVOUR
lbi-3536-8226-0003 IN MAKING THIS HE HAD EXPECTED NO SUCCESS THOUGH FROM THE ENERGETIC NATURE OF HIS DISPOSITION HE HAD MADE THE ATTEMPT WITH SOME ZEAL
lbi-3536-8226-0004 MISSUS BOZZLE WAS DISPOSED TO THINK THAT LADIES OF QUALITY AMONG WHOM MADAME T WAS ENTITLED IN HER ESTIMATION TO TAKE RANK WERE SELDOM BETTER THAN THEY OUGHT TO BE AND SHE WAS QUITE WILLING THAT HER HUSBAND SHOULD EARN HIS BREAD BY WATCHING THE LADY OR THE LADY'S LOVER
lbi-3536-8226-0005 AND HAD THE CASE BEEN BROUGHT BEFORE THE JUDGE ORDINARY BY MEANS OF HER HUSBAND'S EXERTIONS SHE WOULD HAVE TAKEN PLEASURE IN READING EVERY WORD OF THE EVIDENCE EVEN THOUGH HER HUSBAND SHOULD HAVE BEEN EVER SO ROUGHLY HANDLED BY THE LAWYERS
lbi-3536-8226-0006 A DISTINCT PROMISE OF A HUNDRED POUNDS WAS MADE TO HIM IF HE WOULD HAVE THE CHILD READY TO HAND OVER TO TREVELYAN ON TREVELYAN'S ARRIVAL IN ENGLAND
lbi-3536-8226-0007 OF COURSE IT AIN'T SAID MISSUS BOZZLE
lbi-3536-8226-0008 THE PATERNAL PARENT HAS A RIGHT TO HIS INFANTS NO DOUBT THAT WAS BOZZLE'S LAW
lbi-3536-8226-0009 HE CAN'T SUCKLE EM CAN HE
lbi-3536-8226-0010 WHEN A MARRIED WOMAN HAS FOLLOWERS AND THE HUSBAND DON'T GO THE WRONG SIDE OF THE POST TOO OR IT AIN'T PROVED AGAIN HIM THAT HE DO THEY'LL NEVER LET HER HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE CHILDREN
lbi-3536-8226-0011 I'LL TELL YOU WHAT IT IS B EXCLAIMED MISSUS BOZZLE IT'S MY BELIEF AS HE AIN'T QUITE RIGHT UP HERE AND MISSUS BOZZLE TOUCHED HER FOREHEAD
lbi-3536-8226-0012 DRAT EM ALL WHAT IS IT THEY WANTS THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY WANTS
lbi-3536-8226-0013 IT'S THAT AS MAKES EM I WON'T SAY WHAT
lbi-3536-8226-0014 BUT AS FOR THIS HERE CHILD B
lbi-3536-8226-0015 TREVELYAN HAD FOLLOWED HIS LETTER QUICKER THAN HE HAD INTENDED WHEN IT WAS WRITTEN AND WAS NOW WITH HIS PRIME MINISTER BEFORE HIS PRIME MINISTER HAD BEEN ABLE TO TAKE ANY ACTION ON THE LAST INSTRUCTION RECEIVED
lbi-3536-8226-0016 DOES ONE MISTER SAMUEL BOZZLE LIVE HERE ASKED TREVELYAN
lbi-3536-8226-0017 THEN BOZZLE CAME FORWARD AND INTRODUCED HIS WIFE
lbi-3536-8226-0018 BUT TREVELYAN WAS OF A DIFFERENT OPINION AND HE WAS DISGUSTED AND REVOLTED MOST UNREASONABLY BY THE APPEARANCE OF HIS MINISTER'S DOMESTIC ARRANGEMENTS
lbi-3536-8226-0019 BOZZLE HAD ALWAYS WAITED UPON HIM WITH A DECENT COAT AND A WELL BRUSHED HAT AND CLEAN SHOES
lbi-3536-8226-0020 IT IS VERY MUCH EASIER FOR SUCH MEN AS MISTER BOZZLE TO CARRY DECENCY OF APPEARANCE ABOUT WITH THEM THAN TO KEEP IT AT HOME
lbi-3536-8226-0021 PERHAPS YOU COULD PUT ON YOUR COAT AND WALK OUT WITH ME FOR A FEW MINUTES SAID TREVELYAN
lbi-3536-8226-0022 MISSUS BOZZLE WHO WELL UNDERSTOOD THAT BUSINESS WAS BUSINESS AND THAT WIVES WERE NOT BUSINESS FELT NO ANGER AT THIS AND HANDED HER HUSBAND HIS BEST COAT
lbi-3536-8226-0023 BOZZLE AWAY FROM HIS OWN HOME OUT ON BUSINESS WITH HIS COAT BUTTONED OVER HIS BREAST AND HIS BEST HAT IN HIS HAND WAS AWARE THAT HE COMMANDED RESPECT AND HE COULD CARRY HIMSELF ACCORDINGLY
lbi-3536-8226-0024 I DO NOT SUPPOSE THAT ANYBODY WILL QUESTION MY RIGHT TO HAVE THE CARE OF MY OWN CHILD SAID TREVELYAN
lbi-3536-8226-0025 IF YOU WOULD HAVE GONE TO MISTER SKINT SIR SUGGESTED BOZZLE
lbi-3536-8226-0026 AS HE WENT ABOUT HIS EYES WERE EVER CAST DOWNWARDS AND HE WALKED WITH A QUICK SHUFFLING GAIT AND HE SUSPECTED OTHERS FEELING THAT HE HIMSELF WAS SUSPECTED
lbi-3536-8226-0027 AND ALL WORK HAD CEASED WITH HIM
lbi-3536-8226-0028 HE'S UP IN TOWN SIR A MINDING OF HIS PARLIAMENTARY DUTIES
lbi-3536-8226-0029 I'VE WATCHED AS SHARP AS WATCHING CAN GO PRETTY NEAR
lbi-3536-8226-0030 BUT IF YOU ASK ME MY OPINION WHY IN COURSE THEY'VE BEEN TOGETHER SOMEWHERE
lbi-3536-8226-0031 AND BOZZLE AS HE SAID THIS SMILED ALMOST ALOUD
lbi-3536-8226-0032 AND HE DID GO AWAY LEAVING BOZZLE STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF STONY WALK
lbi-3576-138058-0000 MASTER AND MAN DISMOUNTED FROM THEIR BEASTS AND AS SOON AS THEY HAD SETTLED THEMSELVES AT THE FOOT OF THE TREES SANCHO WHO HAD HAD A GOOD NOONTIDE MEAL THAT DAY LET HIMSELF WITHOUT MORE ADO PASS THE GATES OF SLEEP
lbi-3576-138058-0001 BUT DON QUIXOTE WHOM HIS THOUGHTS FAR MORE THAN HUNGER KEPT AWAKE COULD NOT CLOSE AN EYE AND ROAMED IN FANCY TO AND FRO THROUGH ALL SORTS OF PLACES
lbi-3576-138058-0002 AT ONE MOMENT IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE WAS IN THE CAVE OF MONTESINOS AND SAW DULCINEA TRANSFORMED INTO A COUNTRY WENCH SKIPPING AND MOUNTING UPON HER SHE ASS AGAIN THAT THE WORDS OF THE SAGE MERLIN WERE SOUNDING IN HIS EARS SETTING FORTH THE CONDITIONS TO BE OBSERVED AND THE EXERTIONS TO BE MADE FOR THE DISENCHANTMENT OF DULCINEA
lbi-3576-138058-0003 WHO IS TOUCHING ME AND UNTRUSSING ME
lbi-3576-138058-0004 DULCINEA IS PERISHING THOU ART LIVING ON REGARDLESS I AM DYING OF HOPE DEFERRED THEREFORE UNTRUSS THYSELF WITH A GOOD WILL FOR MINE IT IS HERE IN THIS RETIRED SPOT TO GIVE THEE AT LEAST TWO THOUSAND LASHES
lbi-3576-138058-0005 SEEING THIS SANCHO GOT UP AND GRAPPLING WITH HIS MASTER HE GRIPPED HIM WITH ALL HIS MIGHT IN HIS ARMS GIVING HIM A TRIP WITH THE HEEL STRETCHED HIM ON THE GROUND ON HIS BACK AND PRESSING HIS RIGHT KNEE ON HIS CHEST HELD HIS HANDS IN HIS OWN SO THAT HE COULD NEITHER MOVE NOR BREATHE
lbi-3576-138058-0006 HOW NOW TRAITOR EXCLAIMED DON QUIXOTE
lbi-3576-138058-0007 DOST THOU REVOLT AGAINST THY MASTER AND NATURAL LORD
lbi-3576-138058-0008 DOST THOU RISE AGAINST HIM WHO GIVES THEE HIS BREAD
lbi-3576-138058-0009 DON QUIXOTE GAVE HIS PROMISE AND SWORE BY THE LIFE OF HIS THOUGHTS NOT TO TOUCH SO MUCH AS A HAIR OF HIS GARMENTS AND TO LEAVE HIM ENTIRELY FREE AND TO HIS OWN DISCRETION TO WHIP HIMSELF WHENEVER HE PLEASED
lbi-3576-138058-0010 SANCHO ROSE AND REMOVED SOME DISTANCE FROM THE SPOT BUT AS HE WAS ABOUT TO PLACE HIMSELF LEANING AGAINST ANOTHER TREE HE FELT SOMETHING TOUCH HIS HEAD AND PUTTING UP HIS HANDS ENCOUNTERED SOMEBODY'S TWO FEET WITH SHOES AND STOCKINGS ON THEM
lbi-3576-138058-0011 HE TREMBLED WITH FEAR AND MADE FOR ANOTHER TREE WHERE THE VERY SAME THING HAPPENED TO HIM AND HE FELL A SHOUTING CALLING UPON DON QUIXOTE TO COME AND PROTECT HIM
lbi-3576-138058-0012 DON QUIXOTE DID SO AND ASKED HIM WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM AND WHAT HE WAS AFRAID OF
lbi-3576-138058-0013 SANCHO REPLIED THAT ALL THE TREES WERE FULL OF MEN'S FEET AND LEGS
lbi-3576-138058-0014 DON QUIXOTE WAS ON FOOT WITH HIS HORSE UNBRIDLED AND HIS LANCE LEANING AGAINST A TREE AND IN SHORT COMPLETELY DEFENCELESS HE THOUGHT IT BEST THEREFORE TO FOLD HIS ARMS AND BOW HIS HEAD AND RESERVE HIMSELF FOR A MORE FAVOURABLE OCCASION AND OPPORTUNITY
lbi-3576-138058-0015 HE WAS MOUNTED UPON A POWERFUL HORSE AND HAD ON A COAT OF MAIL WITH FOUR OF THE PISTOLS THEY CALL PETRONELS IN THAT COUNTRY AT HIS WAIST
lbi-3576-138058-0016 HE SAW THAT HIS SQUIRES FOR SO THEY CALL THOSE WHO FOLLOW THAT TRADE WERE ABOUT TO RIFLE SANCHO PANZA BUT HE ORDERED THEM TO DESIST AND WAS AT ONCE OBEYED SO THE GIRDLE ESCAPED

lbi-3576-138058-0021 THEY MADE HASTE TO OVERTAKE THEM WHICH AS THE PARTY MOVED SLOWLY THEY WERE ABLE TO DO WITH EASE
lbi-3576-138058-0022 THE WOUNDED GENTLEMAN OPENED HIS ALL BUT CLOSED EYES AND RECOGNISING CLAUDIA SAID I SEE CLEARLY FAIR AND MISTAKEN LADY THAT IT IS THOU THAT HAST SLAIN ME A PUNISHMENT NOT MERITED OR DESERVED BY MY FEELINGS TOWARDS THEE FOR NEVER DID I MEAN TO NOR COULD I WRONG THEE IN THOUGHT OR DEED

lbi-3576-138058-0028 CLAUDIA TOLD HIM SHE MEANT TO GO TO A MONASTERY OF WHICH AN AUNT OF HERS WAS ABBESS WHERE SHE INTENDED TO PASS HER LIFE WITH A BETTER AND EVERLASTING SPOUSE

lbi-3576-138058-0037 THE CAPTAINS SHOWED PLAINLY THE CONCERN THEY FELT THE REGENT'S LADY WAS DOWNCAST AND THE PILGRIMS DID NOT AT ALL ENJOY SEEING THEIR PROPERTY CONFISCATED

lbi-3576-138058-0039 ONE OF THE SQUIRES OBSERVED IN HIS MIXTURE OF GASCON AND CATALAN THIS CAPTAIN OF OURS WOULD MAKE A BETTER FRIAR THAN HIGHWAYMAN IF HE WANTS TO BE SO GENEROUS ANOTHER TIME LET IT BE WITH HIS OWN PROPERTY AND NOT OURS
lbi-3576-138058-0040 THEY WERE ALL TAKEN ABACK AND NOT ONE OF THEM DARED TO UTTER A WORD SUCH DEFERENCE DID THEY PAY HIM
